PRESS RELEASE  
ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE INTERVENTION  
OF THE CENTRAL BANK  
 
  
The Central Bank of Turkey has announced through several press releases that 
under the floating exchange rate regime the level of exchange rate is determined by 
supply and demand conditions in the currency markets, and that the Central Bank 
closely monitors the volatility in the exchange rate, and may directly intervene in the 
markets in the event of an excessive volatility that m ight occur in either directions.  
The recently observed foreign exchange sales arising from the global liquidity 
conditions have led to excessive volatility in exchange rates. The appreciation of 
Turkish lira has become more apparent in the face of the US d ollar volatility in 
international markets. Therefore, the Central Bank has decided to directly intervene in 
the markets today by buying foreign currency in order to prevent the current and 
expected excessive volatility.
