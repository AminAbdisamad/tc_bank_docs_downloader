SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: June 16, 2008
Inflation Developments
1. Consumer prices increased by 1.49 percent in May and annual inflation rose to 10.74
percent. The rise in food and energy prices continued to be the major driver of
inflation, accounting for about 7 percentage points of annual inflation as of May.
2. The year-on-year rate of increase in food and nonalcoholic beverages surged to an
all-time high of 15.69 percent since the inception of the new consumer index in 2003.
Even though fresh fruit and vegetable prices displayed some correction, inflation in
other unprocessed food prices continued to rise, driving up annual inflation in overall
unprocessed food to 8.26 percent in May. Yet, a further correction in fresh fruit and
vegetable prices is likely to be observed in June as well. Meanwhile, the processed
food prices continued to accelerate in May, pushing the group’s annual inflation as
high as 22.83 percent. Sub-groups, particularly bread and grain prices and prices for
oils and fats, continued to increase markedly. The annual inflation in processed food
prices is expected to remain elevated for some time.
3. Energy prices were up 0.77 percent in May to an annual rate of 17.70 percent, as fuel
prices rose by 2.58 percent due to record-high world oil prices. Domestic energy
prices are likely to continue increasing in the short term on the back of the adoption of
automatic price adjustment mechanism in setting electricity tariffs.
4. Inflation in goods excluding energy and unprocessed food increased by 1.35
percentage points to an annual rate of 9.90 percent in May, of which 7.40 percentage
points can be explained by the rise in processed food prices.
5. The impact of higher food and energy prices on services inflation continued into May.
Prices for catering and transport services have shown a monthly increase of 1.82 and
1.79 percent, respectively, which together accounted for almost half of the annual
services inflation rate of 9.86 percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (the
Committee) noted that prices for services other than catering and transport remained
relatively flat, and that the annual rental inflation registered a decline of 6 points over
the past one year.
6. Core inflation indicators have continued to rise due to first and second round effects
of the ongoing supply shocks. The Committee stated that inflation is expected to
decelerate starting the final quarter of the year, although base effects are likely to
keep annual inflation at elevated levels in the short term.

Factors Affecting Inflation
7. Data available for the first half of the year suggest an ongoing moderation in the
economic activity. During the first four months, industrial production was nearly
unchanged from the last quarter in 2007 on a seasonally adjusted basis.
8. The global credit crunch continues to restrain domestic demand. The seasonally
adjusted CNBC-e consumption index continued to decline during April and May.
Domestic sales of automobiles and white goods and imports of consumer goods also
indicate a similar picture. The Committee emphasized that the chemical production,
which is sensitive to changes in domestic demand, fell significantly in both monthly
and annual terms between March and April. Moreover, imports of consumer goods
were down from the first-quarter average in April in seasonally adjusted terms.
9. The CNBC-e consumer confidence index, which has been falling since the last
quarter of 2007, also remained weak in May. Moreover, recent data indicate that real
consumer loans further moderated in April and May.
10. The Committee assessed that soaring food prices and ongoing uncertainties continue
to curb the domestic demand. Indicators from the Consumer Tendency Survey,
especially on households’ willingness to purchase semi-durable and durable goods,
lend support for this assessment.
11. Global and domestic uncertainties have been slowing down the investment demand.
The Committee noted that the number of newly established firms has dropped over
the first half of 2008, indicating an ongoing moderation in business investment.
12. Despite the positive outlook for external demand, machinery-equipment production
continued to flatten in April. The decline in domestic sales of commercial vehicles
during the first quarter accelerated in April and May, confirming the slowdown in
investment demand. Imports of capital goods, which displayed a slowdown in the first
quarter, further continued to moderate in April on a seasonally adjusted basis.
13. After having remained flat in 2007 on the back of slowing construction activity, the
production of nonmetallic minerals grew by an annual rate of 6.9 percent during
January-April 2008, making a positive contribution to industrial production. Although
the first-quarter rise in construction employment suggests a rebound over the
previous year, tightening credit conditions and ongoing uncertainties are expected to
put more pressure on the housing market. In fact, households’ willingness to
purchase a new house has been declining, as suggested by the Consumer Tendency
Survey.
14. Labor market conditions improved slightly during the first quarter, mainly driven by the
manufacturing industry employment. In contrast, the service-sector employment has

slowed down further. Accordingly, the Committee indicated that the recent trend in
non-farm employment contain the unit labor costs and consumer demand.
15. External demand has remained relatively strong. Seasonally adjusted figures indicate
that external demand in April was stronger compared to the first-quarter average. As
suggested by the robust pace of exports and the marked slowdown in imports, net
exports are expected to make a positive contribution to economic growth during the
second quarter of the year.
16. In sum, recent readings on supply and demand conditions have been largely in line
with the predictions of the April Inflation Report. Accordingly, aggregate demand
conditions continue to support disinflation.

Monetary Policy and Risks
17. The Committee reassessed the inflation outlook presented under three alternative
scenarios in the April Inflation Report. Recently there have been favorable
developments in unprocessed food prices, while oil prices have followed a
significantly higher course than the prices assumed in the baseline scenario in the
April Inflation Report. Consequently, inflation is expected to decelerate starting from
the last quarter of the year, ending 2009 close to the 7.5 percent inflation target.
18. The Committee emphasized that tighter credit conditions and the weakening in
consumer confidence have continued to moderate domestic demand, hence
supporting disinflation. Relatively moderate pace of inflation in services excluding
transport and catering—items sensitive to food and energy price developments—
support this view. Nevertheless, persisting supply side shocks continue to delay
disinflation, having adverse effects on inflation expectations. In this respect, monetary
tightening exercised in May and June should be perceived as an attempt to
coordinate inflation expectations around the revised targets and thus to prevent the
materialization of second round effects. Adverse impacts of the supply side shocks on
the economy will be more limited should the economic agents align their expectations
for the next three years with the target rates of 7,5 percent, 6.5 percent and 5.5
percent, respectively.
19. The Committee also assessed the liquidity projections and the liquidity management
strategy. Excess liquidity sterilized in the overnight market has been shrinking in the
second half of 2008 due to a reduction in the amount of FX purchased through
regular auctions, fall in Treasury’s foreign debt rollover ratio, and rising money
demand. Accordingly, the Central Bank has provided the required liquidity into the
system via repo auctions, targeting overnight interest rates to materialize at levels
close to Central Bank borrowing rate. Current projections do not point to a permanent
shortage in liquidity. Accordingly, overnight interest rate in the money market will be

targeted to stay close to the Central Bank borrowing rate in the forthcoming period.
Hence, Central Bank’s overnight borrowing rate will continue to be the key policy rate.
20. Main risks to the inflation outlook can be listed as follows:
21. Developments in oil prices continue to pose risks on inflation all over the world. The
automatic adjustment mechanism in electricity tariffs, to be launched soon, is likely to
further increase the domestic energy prices. Considering the ongoing uncertainties
regarding energy prices, the Central Bank will continue to provide the inflation outlook
under alternative scenarios.
22. The persistence of global inflationary pressures is yet to be seen and the impact of
ongoing difficulties in the financial system on the overall economy still continues to be
a major source of uncertainty. A protracted period of global uncertainty has been
keeping risk appetite at low levels and leading to a slowdown in capital flows to
emerging markets. The Committee once again emphasized that monetary policy
would not react to temporary fluctuations in financial markets, but will not hesitate to
implement the necessary monetary tightening should the volatility in the financial
markets translate into a generalized deterioration in the pricing behavior.
23. In sum, the Committee stated that ongoing uncertainties and supply side shocks
continued to pose risks on inflation, and that the Central Bank would consider a
further measured rate hike when needed, so as to prevent the potential second-round
effects of such risk factors. Accordingly, upcoming data related to inflation outlook will
be monitored carefully. The extent and timing of a possible future rate hike will
depend on developments in global markets, external demand, fiscal policy
implementation, and other factors affecting the medium term inflation outlook.
24. Prudent monetary policy is necessary but not a sufficient condition for attaining price
stability. The support from fiscal policy and structural reforms are also critical in this
respect. Preserving the resilience of the economy, especially under current
conditions, requires the continuation of fiscal discipline and structural reforms. In this
respect, the European Union accession process and the implementation of structural
reforms remain to be of utmost importance. In particular, advances in structural
reforms, which would improve the quality of fiscal discipline and enhance the
productivity, are monitored closely with regard to their implications on macroeconomic
and price stability.
