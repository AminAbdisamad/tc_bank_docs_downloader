THE CBRT PRESS RELEASE 
ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE BUYING AUCTIONS 
Considering that strong reserve position would boos t the marketâ€™s confidence in the 
current program and observing the excess foreign ex change supply, the Central Bank of 
Turkey (CBRT) has been conducting daily foreign exc hange buying auctions since 6 May 
2003. The amount of daily auctions was recently rev ised by our press release of 6 October 
2003, and it was also announced that the CBRT might , with a prior notice, make changes in 
the amounts of daily auctions and/or optional selli ng due to unexpected developments in the 
excess foreign exchange supply. 
Due to the recently observed decline in the foreign  exchange supply, the CBRT has 
decreased its daily buying auctions to USD 40 milli on effective from 21 October 2003 for the 
rest of October 2003. Therefore, the maximum amount  of daily foreign exchange buying 
auction can amount to USD 60 million, by the utiliz ation of the buying auction of USD 40 
million and the optional selling of USD 20 million.  
As was announced by previous press releases, the CB RT may, with a prior notice, 
suspend the auctions before the end of the period i n the cases where the depth of foreign 
exchange market is lost and excessive volatility is  observed in exchange rates due to an 
exogenous shock or unpredictable developments. As u sual, the CBRT will continue to closely 
monitor the volatility in exchange rates and will d irectly intervene in the market in case of an 
excessive volatility in both directions.
