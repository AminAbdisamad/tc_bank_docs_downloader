The Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) has been implement ing an inflation 
targeting regime since the beginning of 2006. This regime establishes a framework 
under which the CBT is accountable for achieving it s main goal of price stability, and 
for the policies implemented to pursue this goal. W ithin this framework, as stipulated 
by Article 42 of the Law, the accountability proces s is triggered when there is a 
significant deviation or potential deviation from t he established inflation targets.  
 
The inflation target for end-2010 was jointly set w ith the Government at 6.5 
percent. The CBT policy document “Monetary and Exch ange Rate Policy in 2010”, 
issued on December 10, 2009 stated that if the abso lute value of the difference 
between the actual inflation rate and the target ra te exceeds 2 percentage points at 
the end of any quarter, the accountability mechanis m would be enforced. In this 
context, it was stated that the CBT, in the case in flation falls outside the band within 
that year, would explain through the quarterly Inflation Report the r easons for the 
breach, and the measures that would be taken to ens ure that inflation would revert to 
the pre-established targets. Should inflation fall outside the uncertainty band at the 
end of the year, the CBT would write an open letter  to the Government.  
 
The inflation outturn as of March 2010 was 9.56 per cent, breaching the upper 
limit of the uncertainty band, which was set at 8.5  percent. Accordingly, attached, for 
your consideration, is the latest Inflation Report issued on April 29, 2010, which 
explains the reasons for the breach of the target, and the strategy adopted by the 
CBT to bring inflation back in line with the medium -term targets. 
 
Yours Sincerely,
