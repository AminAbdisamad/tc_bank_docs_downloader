PRESS RELEASE ON EXPORT REDISCOUNT CREDITS
In order to spur balanced growth, the limit for export rediscount credits is increased by
25 percent. Moreover, the cost of these credits with a maturity longer than four
months is reduced by 20 basis points.
The contribution of export rediscont credits to the CBRT’s reserves is expected to
reach USD 13 billion in year 2014. The increase in limits, reduction of costs and easing
of the conditions are envisaged to lead to a surge in the utilization of export rediscount
credits by exporters and to an increase in the amount contributed from this channel to
the CBRT’s foreign exchange reserves in year 2015.
1. The overall limit for the export rediscount credits, which are granted to exporters
by CBRT is increased from USD 12 billion to USD 15 billion, of which USD 14 billion
have been allocated to Export Credit Bank of Turkey, Inc. (Turkish Eximbank) and 1
billion USD to other commercial banks.
2. In line with the increased overall limit for export rediscount credits, the credit limit
per company for Foreign Trade Capital Companies is raised from USD 240 million to
USD 300 million and for other companies, it is raised from USD 180 million to USD
250 million.
3. The cost of export rediscount credits with a maturity of 121-240 days is reduced by
20 basis points and the interest rate to be applied to these credits is the six-month
LIBOR/EURIBOR interest rate starting from today.
4. A new type of post shipment rediscount export credits for exporters; that are
prepared based on export receivables and assigned to factoring companies which
are then presented to Turkish Eximbank for endorsment and transfered to CBRT, is
launched by the Central Bank of Turkey.
