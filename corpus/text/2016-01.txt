Press Release on FX Collateral Deposit Limits
As stated in the paragraph 20 of the Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2016
document published on December 9th 2015; “Changes made to the guidelines for the
use of FX deposits as collateral have somewhat lowered banks’ need for swap deals
with the market. Banks’ need for swaps can be further reduced through a rise in the
use of this option and in the limits allotted to banks”.
Accordingly, FX deposit limits are increased from 3 billion USD to 3,6 billion USD and
from 900 million EUR to 1,8 billion EUR as of 7 January 2016.
Any further revisions of the FX deposit limits will be announced one business day
before the implementation date, on the pages of Anadolu Ajansı DV006, Reuters CBTJ
and Bloomberg CBT.
