The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to adjust the short term
interest rates as follows:
a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) has been kept at 5.75 percent.
b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate has been kept at 5 percent while lending
rate has been cut from 10 percent to 9.5 percent. Interest rate on borrowing facilities
provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been cut from 9.5 percent to 9
percent.
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing
rate has been kept at 0 percent while lending rate has been cut from 13 percent to 12.5
percent.
Recent data confirm that the rebalancing between the domestic and external demand
continues as envisaged. Domestic demand follows a moderate pace, while exports continue to
increase despite the weakening global outlook. Overall, aggregate demand conditions support
disinflation and current account deficit continues to decline gradually.
The Committee expects the fall in inflation to become more evident during the last
quarter of the year. However, a cautious stance regarding pricing behavior is warranted given
that inflation will stay above the target rate for some time due to recent increases in
administered and energy prices.
Although the risk appetite has improved due to recent developments in financial
markets, ongoing uncertainties regarding the global economy necessitate the monetary policy to
remain flexible on both sides. Therefore, the impact of the measures undertaken on credit,
domestic demand, and inflation expectations will be monitored closely and the funding amount
will be adjusted in either direction, as needed.
The Committee has stated that increasing the reserve option coefficients and narrowing
the interest rate corridor by a measured amount would support financial stability. If deemed
necessary, a measured step in the same direction may be taken in the forthcoming period.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to
revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five
working days.
