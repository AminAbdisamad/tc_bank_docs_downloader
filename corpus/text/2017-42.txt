Press  Release  on Reserve  Requirements  
In the recent  period,  the markets  have  witnessed  unsound  price  formations  that are 
inconsistent  with  economic  fundamentals.   
Taking  this development  into account , with  a view  to supporting  price  stability  and financial  
stability,  the upper  limit  and the tranches  for the FX maintenance  facility  within  the reserve  
options  mechanism  have  been  revised.  
Accordingly,  the upper  limit  for the FX maintenance  facility  has been  lowered  to 55 percent  
from  60 percent  and all tranches  have  been  reduced  by 5 points.
