TURKISH LIRA DEPOSIT BUYING AUCTIONS PROGRAM FOR MA Y 2003 
 
The Central Bank will continue to conduct Turkish l ira deposit buying auctions 
in May 2003 with a standard four-week maturity that  was initiated in April 2002 as a 
supplement to its existing instruments with the aim  of enhancing the effectiveness of 
its efforts to sterilize the excess Turkish lira li quidity in the system. 
  
As was in April 2003, the Central Bank will hold Tu rkish lira deposit buying 
auctions on Wednesdays and Fridays each week and th e maximum amount at each 
auction will be limited to 200 trillion Turkish lir as. 
 
On the other hand, as has already been made public in the Letters of Intent and 
the previous Central Bank press releases, in the ca ses where there is an excess foreign 
exchange supply resulting from the reverse currency  substitution process and the 
strong balance of payments position, the Central Ba nk may resume foreign exchange 
buying auctions with the aim of enhancing its forei gn exchange reserves, without 
conflicting with the floating exchange rate regime,  and without disrupting the long-
term trend and the natural equilibrium level of the  exchange rate. In this respect, the 
developments arising from the excess foreign exchan ge supply are being closely 
monitored by the Central Bank. In the event of a de cision on the resumption of holding 
programmed foreign exchange buying auctions, the Ce ntral Bank will start the 
auctions by making the announcement in advance.
