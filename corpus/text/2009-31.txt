CBRT PRESS RELEASE ON REQUIRED RESERVES  
As a result of both the reduced foreign funding facilities of the banking sector 
and the increased prudence of banks due to the global crisis, credit supply has 
deteriorated. Credit demand, on the other hand, has recessed because of the 
slowing economic activity and uncertainties. These developments, in turn, have resulted in contraction of the credit market.  
Meanwhile, subsequent policy rate cuts since November 2008 have recently 
started to weigh more on market and retail bank interest rates and with the support of the measures on Turkish Lira and foreign currency liquidity taken by the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) coupled with the favorable developments regar ding 
risk perceptions in global markets, a recovery has started to be observed in credit growth, albeit modestly.  
In this conjuncture, in order to support the upward trend in credit growth by 
way of reducing intermediation costs and injecting permanent liq uidity into the 
market, in addition to the measures that have already been taken by the Bank, the Turkish Lira required reserve ratio, which currently stands at 6 percent, has been 
reduced by 1 percentage point to 5 percent.  
By this reduction in the Turkis h Lira required reserve ratio, a permanent 
liquidity that is equivalent to approximately TL 3.3 billion has been provided to the banking system
. 
The required reserve ratio, which is one of the effective tools that can be used 
to permanently change the amou nt of liquidity in the market, may be re- adjusted in 
both directions when deemed necessary, depending on the nature of developments 
in liquidity conditions and credit markets.
