PRESS RELEASE 
ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE INTERVENTION 
OF THE CENTRAL BANK  
 
  
The Central Bank of Turkey has announced in several  press releases that under 
the floating exchange rate regime the level of exch ange rate is determined by supply 
and demand conditions in the currency markets, and that the Central Bank closely 
monitors the volatility of the exchange rate, and m ay directly intervene in the markets 
in the event of excessive volatility occurring in e ither directions. 
In the same way, the Central Bank directly interven ed in the foreign currency 
market on 13 June 2006 by selling foreign currency in order to curb the excessive 
volatility in line with the liquidity shortage in t he foreign currency market, driven also 
by current global liquidity conditions. 
However, as the excessive volatility of the exchang e rate has recently been 
observed to continue, the Central Bank has decided today to intervene in the exchange 
rate once again by selling foreign currency.
