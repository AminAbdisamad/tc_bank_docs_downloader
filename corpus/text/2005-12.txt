February Inflation and Outlook

I. GENERAL EVALUATTON

i. According to the indices with base year 2003, in February 2005, the CPI rose by
0.02 percent and the PPI by 0.11İ percent. The annual rates of increase in the CPI
and PPI declined to 8.69 percent and 10.58 percent, respectively.

2. CPI excluding unprocessed food, energy, alcoholic beverages, tobacco products,
administered prices and indirect taxes, which is one of the special CPI aggregates,
dropped by 0.18 percent (Table i). The annual rate of increase for the aforementioned aggregate, which was 8.77 percent in January 2005, declined to 8.58
percent in February (Figure İ). All the special CPI aggregates in the SIS bulletin,
underline a lower rate of annual inflation.

3. In February 2005, the PPI excluding agriculture rose by 0.17 percent (Table İ).
The same index increased by i2.12 percent annualiy (Figure İ).

4. Within this framework, in February, the decline in consumer inflation relatively

gained pace and February 2005 has become a favorable month in terms of inflation

developments.

Developments in Consumer Prices

5. The main factors determining consumer inflation in February 2005 are i) the
increase in Special Consumption Tax (SCT) of cigarettes and alcohol, ii) the cut in

VAT at the beginning of the year İli) the appreciation of the New Turkish Lira.

6. The increase in the SCT of cigarettes and alcohol, caused increases in the prices
of alcoholic beverages in rates varying between 1İ7.6 percent and 23.5 percent at the
beginning of the month. In the days that followed, the SCT increases led to a 4-5
percent rise in some foreign cigarettes. Accordingiy, in February 2005, the item with
the highest rate of increase within the CPI became alcoholic beverages and tobacco

products with 1.95 percent.

7. The fact that the share of alcoholic beverages and tobacco group, whose prices
are determined mostly by the public, has risen remarkably according to the index
with 2003 base year compared to the index with 1994 base year, indicates that
lump-sum tax increases will be more influential on inflation compared to the previous
period. That is why it is important to make these increases compatible with the end
year target and spread them throughout the year.

8. Besides the increase in the SCT, another tax issue affecting February inflation
was a İ0 percent cut in the VAT on food, education and health. The impact of the
cut was not very visible in the food and non-alcoholic beverages group due to
seasonal price increases. However, price increases having realized below seasonal

averages in this group in January and February, highlight the fact that the decline in

05-01

05-02
VAT might have been effective. On the other hand, in the education and health
groups, the influence of VAT cut is more apparent: prices of education services have
dropped by 0.69 percent in the last two months. During this period, in which prices
of health services are generally adjusted for the next six months, the price increases
in the health services group, were recorded at historically low levels. Health group
prices which had risen 7.26 percent in the January-February period of the previous
year, increased by only 0.17 percent in the same period this year. Thus, the annual
price increase in the health group that stood at İ1./70 percent by the end of 2004,

declined to 4.3İ percent, as of February.

9. Along with this, in the November 2004 and February 2005 period, the
appreciation of the New Turkish lira in terms of the US dollar with the average value
of 10.4 percent limited the price increase in most of the goods items. Indeed,
according to the series obtained using the three-digit classification of the index with
2003 base year, prices of the goods group declined by 0.29 percent in February
2005. In addition to this, exchange rate developments were also influential on the
0.27 percent decline in the entertainment and culture group (in the new index,

technological goods like DVD players and laptops are included in this group).

10.On the other hand, prices of the services group rose by 0.51İ percent in
February. Though this rate is above the increases in the general CPI and goods
prices, it is considerabiy below the February increases of previous years. While prices
of restaurant-hotel services and rents rose by 1İ.48 percent and İ.24 percent,
respectively, the decline in the prices of education and health services by 0.43

percent and 0.29 percent partially compensated for these increases.

Developments in Producer Prices

11. In February, the PPI increased by 0.11İ percent. Compared to December 2003,
the PPI decreased by 0.30 percent and compared to the same month last year, İt

increased by 10.58 percent.

12. While monthly agricultural prices dropped by 0.12 percent, the PPI, excluding
agriculture, (the industrial sector) increased by 0.17 percent. In year-on-year terms,
the former increased by 5.49 percent and the latter by 12.12 percent. In the light of
these figures, it can be asserted that the relative prices have developed cyclicaliy in

favor of the industrial sector.

13. Manufacturing industry prices increased by 0.14 percent in February. The 4.3
percent rise in coke coal and refined oil prices, which stemmed from the
developments in international oil prices, became the primary determinants of this
increase. As the unfavorable impact of international energy prices on manufacturing
industry prices is expected to persist in the upcoming period, it is important that oil

prices are closely followed.

14. Energy prices (electricity, gas, water) within the PPI increased by 0.12 percent.

The year-on-year rise in energy prices has reached 3.32 percent.

15. Tobacco products prices within the manufacturing sector have decreased by a
significant 22.70 percent, which can be accepted as the effect of the rise in SCT on
tobacco products. As taxes are not included in the calculation of the production
prices, any rise in SCT exerts a downward pressure on prices excluding tax. While
this implies a decline in profit margins, it is believed that a direct correspondence
cannot be established between the decline in tobacco products prices and production

COSİs.

16.1In the manufacturing industry sector, prices in the basic metal industry
decreased by 1İ.96 percent in February. Meanwhile, prices of metal products
increased by 0.72 percent and machinery-eguipment by 0.56 percent. It is expected
that the decline in the basic metal industry prices will be reflected in the prices of
metal products and machinery-eguipment. However, the downward effect might be

rather limited as international basic metal prices are on the rise.

17. The 12 percent decline in the prices of office machines manufacturing is also a
development worth noting. However, the subject decline is believed to be caused by
the annual price adjustments and no further downward pricing is expected. On the
contrary, the prices in this sector are likely to display a gradual but limited rise due

to input costs and demand developments throughout the year.

IT. OUTLOOK

Inflation Developments

18. Towards the end of 2004, there has been a downward movement in the inflation
trend due to a slowdown in the rise in costs. Inflation figures of February support a
favorable outlook. It is expected that the historically low accumulated inflation
figures recorded in February would push the inflation expectations down. This will
contribute to the easing of the rigidity created by services sector prices and the

inertia in inflation.

19.1It would be useful to exclude the CPI from the effects of some exogenous
factors for a better evaluation of the inflation figures. For instance, unexpected
changes in raw materlal prices, prices affected by weather conditions and public
prices may affect indices and lead to misinterpretation of main inflation trend.
Moreover, the absence of well-established fiscal discipline and structural changes
that the economy undergoes can lead to freguent changes in taxes. The special CPI
aggregates (F and G), which have been developed with the aim of isolating inflation
from such external factors, have displayed a declining trend since October 2004.

Therefore, it can be asserted that the downward trend in overall inflation continues.

20. Meanwhile, developments in producer prices sub-items emit positive signals as
to the future inflation trend. As the PPI has started to be constructed from pre-tax
producer prices with the new index, the information contained in producer prices for
consumer prices has weakened. However, the accumulated decline in the PPI in the
first two months of the year would help limit the rise in consumer prices through the
cost channel. As a result, inflation figures recorded in the first two months are

promising.

21. While analyzing inflation, the Central Bank takes into account the medium-term
outlook and makes use of past inflation figures for information that they provide
about the future inflation trend. Any downward/upward movement in inflation in a
given month does not mean an overall upward/downward movement in inflation.
Therefore, opting for a medium-term point of view is very important while making
such an analysis. Seasonal conditions, public price adjustments, changes in tax rates
and oill prices can easily lead to lower/higher rates in inflation in any month. For
instance, in August 2004, the current inflation figures were higher-than-expected,

however the Central Bank interpreted the information contained in these figures
correctly and lowered interest rates by projecting that the future inflation trend
would be downward. The Bank's projections proved to be true as the favorable trend
in inflation continued. We would like to underline that closely monitoring the Bank's
future inflation trend projections would assist and enhance comprehension of the
Bank's decisions and discourage negative critics that could undermine the credibility

of monetary polices.

22. Likewise, another false evaluation is made about “deflation danger.” Deflation is
described as a persistent decrease in the general price level. The drop observed in
inflation in recent months should not be perceived as an ongoing decline in the
general level of prices. Considering the trend of the CPI and the special CPI
aggregates, it is clear that the Turkish economy is far from deflation, contrary to
some statements made in public. Furthermore, such a risk is out of guestion in the
medium term given that economic reforms are continuousiy carried out. In the
harmonization process to the EU, the increasing productivity in sectors subject to
foreign trade will bolster real wages. This increase in real wages will raise wages in
the services sector and continue to exert pressure on prices in the overall economy.
This situation, which is also referred to as the Balassa-Samuelson effect, is freguentliy
seen in the economies of developing countries. For this reason, deflation is out of
guestion and it is almost inevitable that inflation figures will continue to remain
above the EU average during the convergence process of these economles.
Undoubtediy, these predictions are made in the main scenario, in which structural
adjustments are being carried out and bureaucratic barriers against investment and

production are being removed.

Macroeconomic Outlook

23. The outlook report of September 2004, when the Central Bank lowered interest
rates, drew attention to the fact that both the growth rate of the economy and the
domestic demand would slow-down, due to the developments in money demand,
credits, automobile sales and liguidity. In fact, the rise in industrial production held
back in the last guarter of 2004. In addition to these developments, domestic sales
of automobiles and commercial vehicles dropped in January compared to the

previous year. This, along with the fact that deferred demand is fulfilled to a great
extent, indicate that the relative slow-down in the rate of increase of demand in the

second half of 2004 continues in January 2005.

24. Meanwhile, investments are expected to recover in the second guarter of the
year owing to the increase in the real sector confidence index. Recently, imports of
intermediary goods have continued to grow and new orders made by the domestic
market for the next three-month period, published in the Business Tendency Survey,
display a significant rise. Moreover, the same survey point to positive expectations
for financing —costs. Industrial production data for January — shows
that the increases in production are converging to program projections. In light of
these data, the revival in production is predicted to continue and a relative revival in
economic activity is expected in the first guarter of the year, compared to the

previous guarter on seasonally adjusted terms.

2b5. Labor market developments in the last guarter of 2004: indicate an ongoing rise
in total employment. Considering the latest developments in employment and
production, the increase in labor efficiency lost momentum as it was expected in our
previous reports. Taking into account the upward trend of real wages, this situation
supports our expectation that real unit wages will not affect cost conditions as
favorably as they had done in previous periods. Meanwhile, the appreciation of YIL
against foreign currencies on both nominal and real basis in the previous period has

had a favorable effect on unit costs.

26. In light of supply and demand developments, domestic demand is expected to
be below the potential production level of the economy. The slow recovery of the
consumer confidence index observed as of August 2004 and low capacity utilization
ratios, which have not reached a İlevel to exert pressure on prices, support this
prediction. Moreover, as a result of the current incomes policy, the consumption
composition is expected to continue contributing to the decline in inflation. However,
credit utilizattıon has increased in consumption financing parallel to the rise in
installment sales and expectations for a drop in interest rates. This situation is being
closely monitored in terms of both domestic demand and financial stability. The legal
regulations regarding credit card utilization are expected to diminish related potential

risks.

27. In short, supply-demand conditions maintain their favorable course in terms of

their direct and indirect effects on prices. Iİt is foreseen that the growth rate will be
converging to program projections as of the second half of the year owing to
increasing consumer and producer confidence and sustainable performance of
exports. Predictions for the year 2005 indicate that the said growth will not threaten
the decline in inflation. In conclusion, domestic demand developments will maintain
their modest course in the short term and the increase in labor productivity is

expected to continue, although at a slower pace.

28. Nevertheless, the analysis mentioned above gives a short-term outlook. In the
medium term, the course of favorable developments in inflation is based on the
medium term trend followed by the macroeconomic variables affecting inflation. The
main factors are the developments in productivity and the supply-demand balance.
The outlook of productivity and the general balance depends on external factors and

current and future macroeconomic policies.

29. At this point, it is useful to emphasize once again the support given to the
disinflation process by current economic policies: The budgetary discipline and the
inflation-focused  monetary policy that have been implemented with  strict
determination for the last three years has kept inflationary pressures under control
by preventing domestic demand from exceeding sustainable growth rates. In
addition to these factors and with the contribution of a series of structural
arrangements reducing the inefficiencies in the economy, as well as steps taken in
the area of Central Bank independence, a significant achievement has been obtained
in terms of expectation management and the credibility of economic policies. Thus,
the disinflation process and the high growth rates could be sustained at the same
time. Factors such as the implementation of structural reforms, higher integration to
the world, keeping domestic demand under control and the floating exchange rate

regime also enhanced domestic competition and resulted in productivity increases.

The Relation Between Inflation and the Exchange Rates

30. It was mentioned in sections where developments in the sub-items of inflation
were analyzed that exchange rate developments contributed to the İow inflation
figures in the first two months of the year. At this point, it will be useful to reemphasize certain points which are believed not yet to have been properly

understood regarding the inflation-exchange rate relationship: Studies have revealed
that the pass-through from exchange rates to İnflation was extremely strong in
Turkey before 2001. However, the same studies also point to an evident break, affer
the 2001 crisis, in the exchange rate pass-through to prices. The main reasons of
this break can be listed as; decline in the duration and persistence of exchange rate
movements following the adoption of the floating exchange rate regime, increased
domestic competition on account of changing economic conditions, inflation targets
acting more as a nominal anchor, owing to increasing credibility of economic policies,

and changing pricing behavior of firms as a result of the fall in inflation.

31. — However, independent of the monetary and exchange rate policies, the fact
that Turkey is an open economy, unable to set prices in international markets, makes
it inevitable that inflation will be influenced by fluctuations in the exchange rate. This
also has to do with the fact that the goods basket covered by the CPI consists mostly
of traded goods, as well as the high share of imported intermediate goods in the
composition of the input costs of the economy in general. However, what needs to
be emphasized here is that, under the current regime, the influence of the exchange
rate on inflation decreased in an obvious manner, compared to the pre-2001 period,
and that the exchange rate is no more the main determinant of inflation, but oni/y
öne of the determinants. Besides, the exchange rate developments under the
floating exchange rate regime are the results of the current economic policies. İt is
possible that there might be fluctuations stemming from external shocks in the
coming period, as was the case in the past. What needs to be emphasized here is
that as long as the necessary steps are taken on the road to macroeconomic
stability, such shocks will be bound to be temporary deviations from the main trend;
otherwise, they may pose serious risks to inflation, causing deterioration in

expectations.

32. — Another issue that needs to be discussed is how the price index change
affected the inflation-exchange rate relationship. The answer to this guestion can be
reached by looking from two different angles. The first angle considers the content
of the index. Compared to the CPI index with a 1994 base year, the CPI index with a
2003 base year contains more goods groups, with prices susceptible to the
exchange rate. This causes the reflections of exchange rate movements on the
general index to appear slightly higher (in either direction). However, in spite of the
influence caused by the new price index, the exchange rate-inflation relationship is

estimated to be much weaker compared to the pre-2001 period. As for the PPI, the
announcement of producer prices, which exclude taxes, together with the index with
2003 as the base year, increased the susceptibility of this index to the exchange
rate. In conclusion, it can be asserted that, independent of the composition of the
index, the relationship between inflation and the exchange rate has weakened in the

structural sense.

33. — The second angle is one of time . It is guite difficult to make comparisons
between the old and the new price indices, with regard to the course of the passthrough in time. The main source of this difficulty is that the new index series does
not have sufficient number of observations to secure the reliability of the statistical
analysis yet. In this case, although the known statistical technigues seem to be
applicable from a solely-numerical perspective, the results produced by these

technigues provide evidence which is far from reliable enough.

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy

34. Needless to say, it is impossible to foresee the future course of exchange rates
of the upcoming period. The Central Bank does not act with a certain exchange level
in mind while implementing its exchange rate policy; it mainiy focuses on keeping
the potential volatility in exchange rates at İow levels in order to ensure financial
market stability. Recently, developments about European Union negotiations have
boosted the capital inflow via reinforcing favorable expectations about the future. At
this point, it is crucilal to be cautious against the perceptions that all problems have
been overcome. ÂAs a matter of fact, Turkey has just started to overcome the
economic collapse brought about by the crisis in 2001 and the actions initiated to
fully establish macroeconomic stability have not yet been completed. It should be
always kept in mind that only through macroeconomic stability would it be possible
to keep the volatility of asset prices to a minimum İlevel in the medium-term.
Accordingiy, stimulating the structural arrangements bears great importance for
increasing the resilience to exogenous shocks and reducing the potential volatility

brought about by the likelihood of a reversal in global liguidity conditions.

35. Another important development in terms of the monetary policy of the upcoming
period is the increase in New Turkish lira-denominated İlong-term bond issues of
international institutions. For these institutions will try to close their positions,
creating a demand for domestic bond markets. This demand will extend the

borrowing maturity as well as reduce the borrowing cost;: and this, in turn, will
increase the relative effectiveness of the monetary policy via alleviating fiscal
dominance. These developments bode well for the inflation targeting policy to be
adopted in 2006. With the extension of maturities and the decline in risk premium,
not only the current but also the future stance of monetary policy will have gained

importance and this will provide the market players with a medium-term perspective.

36. In conclusion, there seem to be no obvious risks to the inflation target in the
short-term other than significant exogenous shocks: however, we are in a period
where the medium-term outlook is shaped by structural reforms. In light of the
above mentioned analyses as well as the other developments in the previous month
and taking into account the evaluations made at the Monetary Policy Board meeting
held on March 8, 2005, the Central Bank decided to cut the short-term interest rates
applicable on the CBRT Interbank Money Market and Istanbul Stock Exchange RepoReverse Repo Market by İ point to be effective as of March 9, 2005. The Central
Bank is maintaining its cautiousiy optimistic stance for the upcoming period. The
above mentioned points indicate that fiscal discipline and structural arrangements
are essential for sustaining the downward trend in inflation in the medium-term and
establishing macroeconomic stability permanently. For this reason, while following a
policy focused on future inflation, the Central Bank is trying to anticipate the inflation
outlook on the one hand, and monitoring the developments in social security and
restructuring in income management that will increase the guality of primary surplus,
on the other hand. İt is also closely monitoring the other developments in banking
draft law and fiscal policy, and is taking into account the potential risks while making
its monetary policy decisions. In this context, any arrangement to be made with the
aim of improving the guality of fiscal discipline, reinforcing macroeconomic stability
and reducing inefficiencies in the economy will increase the likelihood of decline in

interest rates.

37.The first point worth emphasizing here is that the current account deficit or
exchange rate or any other variable is included in the decision-making process mnot
directiy but indirectiy, only to the extent that ihey contain information for future
inflation. In other words, the interest rate decisions of the Central Bank are never
aimed at directly affecting other variables but future inflation. The second point is
that the fall in short-term interest rates is not a sufficient condition for a fall in longterm interest rates. İt is the improvement in the guality of fiscal discipline as well as

the permanent reduction in risk premium, rather than an artificial cut in short-term
interest rates, that will assure a permanent fall in long-term nominal and real interest
rates. Within this framework, the pace of implementation and continuation of the
steps to be taken in the restructuring of revenue administration, social security

reforms, banking draft law and corporate governance are of critical importance.
