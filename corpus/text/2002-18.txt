PRESS RELEASE  
 
 
In addition to monthly Business Tendency Survey results, published since 1987, the 
Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey has started to publish the overall results of 
the Survey of Expectations that has been conducted as a pilot study since August 3, 
2001. Now that a stable number of respondents is reached and hesitations related to 
questions in the Survey are clarified, the overall results of the Survey are now 
available on the Web site http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/  under the heading of 
“Publications/Periodic Publications/Survey of Expectations ”. 
The aim of the Survey is to determine the  expectations of decision makers and 
experts in the real and financial sectors regarding consumer price index (CPI), 
interest rates, exchange rate, current account balance and the GNP growth rate. The 
Survey is conducted twice a month (at the first and thi rd weeks). From now on, the 
overall results of the Survey will be published twice a month on the Web site stated 
above, after we have received responses to our Survey.  
Please be informed that the previously announced results might be revised later on, 
due to late responses received after the announcement of the overall results. The 
published overall results are offered to the users along with sample size, minimum 
and maximum values, standard deviation, mean, median, mode and appropriate 
mean for each questi on. The selection of the appropriate mean is done by comparing 
mean, median, mode and alpha -trimmed mean.
