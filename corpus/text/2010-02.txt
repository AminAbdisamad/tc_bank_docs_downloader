PRESS RELEASE ON CAPACITY UTILIZATION RATE OF  
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY  
 
The evaluations made during the Official Statistics Program implementation, 
which were launched in 2007, indicated drawbacks arising from the fact that 
“Business Tendency Survey (BTS)” of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey 
(CBRT)  and “Tendencies in Manufacturing Industry (TMI)” survey of the Turkish 
Statistical Institute (TurkStat)  involve similar questions aiming at the same scope of 
survey units . Therefore,  it has been decided that the capacity utilization rate series  
released by the TurkStat  on the basis of the  TMI survey findings  will henceforth be 
prepared and announced by the CBRT, based on the BTS results. The said implementation was put into effect in January 2010 through a protocol signed 
between the CBRT and the TurkStat on December 10, 2009  
The BTS took place within the scope of Short -Term Business Statistics under 
the Official Statistics Program for 2007- 2011, which was drawn up by the TurkStat in 
2006.  As required by the Program objectives, studies were carried out in order to 
ensure its harmonization with the international standards and the expansion of the 
scope of survey units.  
In line with the aforementioned studies, the scope and methodology of the 
BTS were expanded as of January 2007 so as to produce also the results of the TMI 
survey, and as to ensure its full harmonization with the international standards. 
Additionally, the BTS has  been  conducted via the joint financing of the European 
Commission and the CBRT within the scope of the “ Joint Harmonised European 
Union Programme of Business  and Consumer  Surveys”  since May 2007.  
Within the context of these developments; data pertaining to “Capacity 
Utilization Rates” will be compiled by the CBRT on the basis of monthly BTS results 
from January 2010 onwards and will be published at the internet address, 
www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/Publications/Periodic  Publications/Capacity Utilization 
Rate of  Manufacturing Industry  in accordance with National Data Release Calendar 
and, also within the content of “Data/Statistical Data- Electronic Data Distribution 
System (EDDS )”.
