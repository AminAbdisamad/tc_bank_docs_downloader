PRESS RELEASE ON  
THE TECHNICAL CHANGE ON INTEREST RATES  
 
As it is known, the Central Bank announced its liqu idity management strategy for 
2006 with the press release of 5 December 2005, ent itled “General Framework of Inflation 
Targeting Regime and Monetary and Exchange Rate Pol icy for 2006”.  
In Article 59 of the press release, it was stated t hat some technical interest rate 
changes for narrowing the potential volatility marg ins of the overnight interest rates were 
required in view of significant declines in New Tur kish Lira interest rates. It was stated that 
the interest rate, which was set by the Central Ban k in the light of current liquidity conditions 
for daily borrowing transactions, was a benchmark i nterest rate and should not be perceived as 
an interest rate change that was made in considerat ion of the inflation target. It was also 
announced that the margins of basic policy interest  rates were narrowed. Meanwhile, in 
Article 61 of the same press release, it was assert ed that the Central Bank might change both 
the liquidity management strategy and interest rate  margins in cases of unpredictable changes 
in market conditions and in accordance with new req uirements.  
In this framework, with the aim of enhancing the ef fectiveness and flexibility of 
liquidity management, it was decided to make some t echnical changes in the borrowing-
lending interest rate margins, while maintaining CB RT borrowing interest rates unchanged. 
Accordingly: 
a)  The CBRT overnight borrowing interest rate is 17.25 percent, while the CBRT 
lending interest rate is raised to 22.25 percent  from 20.25  percent , 
b)  Within the framework of the Late Liquidity Window F acility, the CBRT overnight 
borrowing interest rate is 13.25 percent, while the lending interest rate is raised to 
25.25 percent  from 23.25 percent , 
c)  The interest rates applicable to overnight and one- week maturity borrowing 
facilities provided for primary dealer banks via re po transactions within the 
framework of open market transactions are raised to  21.25 percent  from 19.25 
percent .
