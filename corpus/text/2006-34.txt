PRESS RELEASE ON
THE TECHNICAL CHANGE ON INTEREST RATES

As it is known, the Central Bank announced its liquidity management strategy for
2006 with the press release of 5 December 2005, entitled “General Framework of Inflation
Targeting Regime and Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2006”.
In Article 59 of the press release, it was stated that some technical interest rate
changes for narrowing the potential volatility margins of the overnight interest rates were
required in view of significant declines in New Turkish Lira interest rates. It was stated that
the interest rate, which was set by the Central Bank in the light of current liquidity conditions
for daily borrowing transactions, was a benchmark interest rate and should not be perceived as
an interest rate change that was made in consideration of the inflation target. It was also
announced that the margins of basic policy interest rates were narrowed. Meanwhile, in
Article 61 of the same press release, it was asserted that the Central Bank might change both
the liquidity management strategy and interest rate margins in cases of unpredictable changes
in market conditions and in accordance with new requirements.
In this framework, with the aim of enhancing the effectiveness and flexibility of
liquidity management, it was decided to make some technical changes in the borrowinglending interest rate margins, while maintaining CBRT borrowing interest rates unchanged.
Accordingly:
a) The CBRT overnight borrowing interest rate is 17.25 percent, while the CBRT
lending interest rate is raised to 22.25 percent from 20.25 percent,
b) Within the framework of the Late Liquidity Window Facility, the CBRT overnight
borrowing interest rate is 13.25 percent, while the lending interest rate is raised to
25.25 percent from 23.25 percent,
c) The interest rates applicable to overnight and one-week maturity borrowing
facilities provided for primary dealer banks via repo transactions within the
framework of open market transactions are raised to 21.25 percent from 19.25
percent.
