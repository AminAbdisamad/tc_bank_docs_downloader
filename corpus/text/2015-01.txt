PRESS RELEASE ON RESERVE REQUIREMENTS  
With a view to supporting financial stability and by taking into account the latest 
developments in global markets, the reserve requirement ratios of foreign exchange 
(FX) denominated liabilities of banks and financing companies are revised in order to 
encourage the extension of maturities  of non -core liabilities , as follows . 
 
Liabilities other than 
deposits/participation funds  Current 
Ratios 
(%) New 
Ratios

With maturity up to (and including) 1 year  13 18 
With maturity up to (and including) 2 
years  11 13 
With maturity up to (and including) 3 
years  11 8 
With maturity up to (and including) 5 
years  6 7 
With maturity longer than 5 years  6 6 
 
The increase in FX reserve requirement ratios, would contribute to the Central Bank 
FX reserves by approximately  USD 3.2 billion . The average  reserve requirement ratio 
for FX, which currently stands at 11.7 percent, will rise to 12.8 percent.  
Besides, to strengthen the automatic stabilizing feature of the Reserve Options 
Mechanism (ROM), technical adjustments are i mplemented in reserve option 
tranches and coefficients, in a way also to largerly compensate for  the FX liquidity 
withdrawal that would arise from the changes in FX reserve requirement ratios. In 
that context, the number of tranches in the ROM, which allow s banks to hold Turkish 
lira required reserves in FX, has been increased while the upper limit left unchanged. 
The new tranches and the corresponding reserve option coefficients (ROCs) have 
been revised as follows.

Banks and financing companies have been consistently using the facility. The 
utilization ratio as of the latest maintenance period stood at 86.1 percent (51.6/60). 
Currently, foreign exchange worth USD 33 billion is being held for Turkish lira 
required reserves. Should the facility continue to be used at the same level , the 
revisio ns in ROM would  release approximately USD 2.4 billion from Central Bank 
reserves.  
The revisions will be effective as of the calculation period  dated  13 February 2015 
and the maintenance period will begin on 27 February 2015.
