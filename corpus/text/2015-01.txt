PRESS RELEASE ON RESERVE REQUIREMENTS
With a view to supporting financial stability and by taking into account the latest
developments in global markets, the reserve requirement ratios of foreign exchange
(FX) denominated liabilities of banks and financing companies are revised in order to
encourage the extension of maturities of non-core liabilities, as follows.

The increase in FX reserve requirement ratios, would contribute to the Central Bank
FX reserves by approximately USD 3.2 billion. The average reserve requirement ratio
for FX, which currently stands at 11.7 percent, will rise to 12.8 percent.
Besides, to strengthen the automatic stabilizing feature of the Reserve Options
Mechanism (ROM), technical adjustments are implemented in reserve option
tranches and coefficients, in a way also to largerly compensate for the FX liquidity
withdrawal that would arise from the changes in FX reserve requirement ratios. In
that context, the number of tranches in the ROM, which allows banks to hold Turkish
lira required reserves in FX, has been increased while the upper limit left unchanged.
The new tranches and the corresponding reserve option coefficients (ROCs) have
been revised as follows.

Banks and financing companies have been consistently using the facility. The
utilization ratio as of the latest maintenance period stood at 86.1 percent (51.6/60).
Currently, foreign exchange worth USD 33 billion is being held for Turkish lira
required reserves. Should the facility continue to be used at the same level, the
revisions in ROM would release approximately USD 2.4 billion from Central Bank
reserves.
The revisions will be effective as of the calculation period dated 13 February 2015
and the maintenance period will begin on 27 February 2015.
