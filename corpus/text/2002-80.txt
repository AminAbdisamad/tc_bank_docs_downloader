which are the main monetary aggregates on the Central Bank (CBRT) balance sheet,
were specified as the indicative targets for the second half of 2002, in the January 18,

realized are given below:

1- The ceiling specified as the performance criterion for the Base Money, the
nominal anchor in the monetary program, was scheduled to be TL 10.600 trillion for
end-September, the calculation of which being based on the averages of the last 5
working days of the month. The average Base Money of the last five days of
September stayed at TL 10.104 trillion, remaining below the TL 10.600 trillion
ceiling.

2- According to the monetary program, the credits obtained by the Treasury
from the İnternational Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2002, and the Treasury's foreign
currency denominated debts with a maturity less than one year are deducted from the
CBRT Net İnternational Reserves in order to determine Net İnternational Reserves.

end-September was minus USD (-) 8,500 million. The realizations pertaining to the
Net İnternational Reserves and sub-items recorded on September 30, 2002 are shown
