The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has d ecided to keep policy rates 
unchanged as follows: 
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 15.2 5 percent, and lending rate at 
19.25 percent, 
b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 
p.m. at 11.25 percent, lending rate at 22.25 percen t, 
c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week matu rity borrowing facilities 
provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 18.25 percent. 
 
Deepening problems in international credit markets continue to restrain the domestic 
demand, while external demand remains strong. Overa ll, aggregate demand conditions will 
continue to support disinflation. However, rising f ood and energy prices and ongoing 
uncertainties in the global economy have worsened i nflation expectations and increased 
the upside risk on inflation. 
The Central Bank of Turkey is strongly committed to  prevent the potential second-
round effects of the recent deterioration in inflat ion expectations. In this regard, the 
Committee will be more responsive to bad news than good news and will consider a 
measured tightening when needed. Future monetary po licy decisions will depend on 
developments regarding global market conditions, ex ternal demand, fiscal policy 
implementation, and other factors affecting the med ium term inflation outlook. 
It should be emphasized that any new data or inform ation related to the inflation 
outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance . 
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meetin g will be released within 
eight working days.
