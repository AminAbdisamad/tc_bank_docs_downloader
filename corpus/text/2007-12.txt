SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 14 May 2007

Inflation Developments
1.

Consumer prices increased by 1.21% in April, bringing annual inflation down
to 10.72%. Yet, the surge in clothing prices restrained the decline in inflation
despite the considerable slowdown in inflation of consumer durables and
services.

2.

The rise in the annual inflation of clothing and footwear can be attributed to the
recent cost-driven hikes in apparel manufacturing prices. Recent course in
clothing and footwear prices suggest that the price developments in this group will
contribute less to the disinflation process in 2007 compared to 2005 and 2006. On
the other hand, the prices of durable goods exhibited a favorable outlook in April,
possibly owing to the strength of Turkish lira as well as the slowdown in domestic
demand.

3.

Recent price developments suggest that services inflation has been easing,
albeit modestly. Annual services inflation dropped to its lowest level since
September 2006. Monthly hikes in services prices from January to April fell
behind the year-ago levels of the same period. Along with the slowdown in
domestic demand, services inflation is expected to decline further gradually in the
upcoming period, yet, the Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) considers
that this improvement may be limited given the backward-looking pricing
behavior, the high-sensitivity of service prices to wage hikes and the relatively low
productivity in this sector.

4.

Monthly inflation in the housing utilities continued to ease in April. On the other
hand, prices of petroleum products re-accelerated by a 6.13% rise in the last two
months, slowing down the decline in headline inflation.

5.

Although clothing prices displayed a sharp rise in April, the favorable
developments in prices of durable goods and services pulled the annual inflation
of all special CPI aggregates down. With the disappearance of the exchange rate
pass-through effect of May and June 2006, the downward trend in the annual rate
of increase of H index will be further noticed in the upcoming period.

6.

Unprocessed food prices continued to rise dramatically, at a rate of 16.63%
per annum. Fruit prices soared by 42.52% in the first four months of 2007, up
from an average 3% monthly rise for the same period in 2005 and 2006. Due to
warm weather conditions beyond seasonal norms, the declines in fresh vegetable
and fruit prices, which normally take place in the summer season, may shift from
June to May. Moreover, exchange rate movements and the subsequent passthrough in May 2006 constitute a high base on the consumer price index. In this
regard, the Committee noted that a partial correction in unprocessed food prices,
and the base effect may contribute to the decline in annual inflation in May.

7.

In light of these developments, the Committee assessed that the awaited signs
of disinflation have emerged in April and that the disinflation trend will be more
significant in the upcoming period.
Factors Affecting Inflation

8.

The Committee identifies the recent data on economic activity as broadly
consistent with the outlook presented in the April Inflation Report.

9.

The slowdown in private consumption demand continues. Consumer credits
exhibit a pattern as outlined in the inflation report. Automobile loans continue to
decrease in real terms. Housing loans are on a rise, albeit at a modest pace.
Personal expenditure loans, on the other hand, continue to increase at a relatively
higher rate but do not reveal a notable acceleration. Despite a limited fall
observed recently, bank loan rates are still above the previous year’s levels and
continue to curb credit expansion.

10. Leading indicators suggest that the slowdown in domestic demand continues.
Sales of automobiles and white goods fell in the first quarter of 2007 in seasonally
adjusted terms. Falling domestic automobile sales in April signify that the private
demand may continue to slowdown in the second quarter. The Committee judges
that tightened financing conditions and growing uncertainties will continue to
suspend the durable goods demand.
11. Foreign demand remains robust. The strong export performance compensates
the negative impact of the slowdown in domestic demand on overall economic
activity. Exports in the first quarter prevailed over imports in real terms. Leading
indicators of April and May suggest that the strong export performance continues.
12. The robust external demand supports industrial production. As suggested by
seasonally adjusted data, industrial production displayed a flat course in the first
quarter. Despite the ongoing stability in industrial production, the fact that last
year’s production was highly volatile may lead to fluctuations in annual growth
rates. Indeed, industrial production rose sharply by around 7.8% in the first
quarter of 2007 owing to the base effect of last year’s first quarter; however, in the

upcoming months, it may display low annual growth rates due to high base in the
second quarter of 2006.
13. Imports of capital goods rose in the first quarter, whereas machineryequipment investments were restrained by the low course of light commercial
vehicle sales. April figures suggest that the slowdown in commercial vehicle sales
continues. Production and import data on non-metallic minerals, on the other
hand, do not refer to any significant slowdown in construction activities.
14. In sum, the recent data confirm the outlook presented in the April Inflation
Report. Aggregate demand conditions continue to support disinflation. Demand
for durable goods and machinery-equipment investment continue to ease, while
strong external demand moderates the slowdown in overall economic activity.
15. The growth rate in services employment decelerated in the last three quarters.
This trend is in line with the slowdown in economic activity. Moreover, industrial
production remained relatively strong while industrial employment displayed a
slowdown, suggesting that labor productivity continued to rise.
16. The recently elevated prices of crude oil and commodities add to the
inflationary pressures via imported input costs and thus curb the disinflation
process. These price movements are closely monitored.
17. Market expectations for end-year inflation increased slightly in April, possibly
due to higher-than–expected inflation outturns. However, the medium-term
inflation expectations have not deteriorated. Inflation expectations for the next 12
months have been improving modestly since early 2007, while those for the next
24 months stayed flat at around 5.5% in general. Medium-term expectations
should move downward as the disinflation process accelerates in the upcoming
period.
Monetary Policy and Risks
18. Global bond issues of foreign financial institutions in YTL and the robust
privatization revenues have been increasing the supply of loanable funds. These
developments exert a downward pressure on bank lending rates. However, the
tight stance of monetary policy and the ongoing perceptions of uncertainty
continue to restrain the demand for credit. Accordingly, consumer credits are
expected to maintain their modest course in the upcoming period.
19. Other monetary indicators also display a similar outlook. Specifically, the
gradual slowdown in the annual growth of banknotes in circulation since the
second half of 2006 is noteworthy. However, the information included in monetary
indicators should be handled with caution due to possible shifts in money demand
arising from changes in portfolio preferences or financial system deepening.

20. The ongoing slowdown in private consumption and investment demand reveal
that the monetary tightening since June 2006 is affecting the domestic demand as
expected. Against this background, disinflation is expected to become more
significant in the upcoming period. However, there are some remaining risks to
the inflation outlook:
21. Possibility of stronger-than-expected inertia in inflation poses a significant risk
for the medium-term inflation outlook. Currently, medium-term inflation
expectations are not aligned with the targets. Although, the Committee expects
the decline in inflation to deliver an improvement in inflation expectations in the
period ahead, the current course of expectations continues to pose a significant
risk to the inflation outlook through wage and price setting behavior.
22. Uncertainties over the lagged effects of monetary policy stand as a major risk
to inflation outlook. The monetary tightening since June 2006 is affecting the
domestic demand as expected. The lagged effects on inflation are yet to be seen.
Although the rate of increase in durable goods and services prices decelerated in
the recent period, these developments do not provide enough evidence to claim
that the current inflation trend is in line with medium-term targets. In addition, the
course of non-interest budget expenditures exacerbates the uncertainty over the
lagged effects of monetary policy.
23. Recently, the developments on international liquidity conditions and global risk
appetite have been in favor of developing countries. However, ongoing
uncertainties concerning global economy and volatile commodity prices pose risk
to inflation. Should any such shock threaten the medium-term inflation outlook,
the Central Bank will react depending on the source of the shock.
24. The Central Bank does not respond to temporary fluctuations in inflation.
Decisions of the Monetary Policy Committee are based on an overall evaluation
of all factors affecting medium-term inflation, rather than temporary fluctuations in
inflation. In other words, the Central Bank decisions are focused on achieving
consistency between medium-term inflation and the targets. In this regard,
although disinflation is expected to become more significant in the upcoming
period, the Committee, with a medium term perspective, decided to keep the
policy rates unchanged against the risks such as the gap between inflation
expectations and targets, the backward looking pricing behavior, elevated oil
prices, prevailing uncertainties, and the stickiness related to services price
inflation.
25. Moreover, the potential impacts of the progress in the structural reform agenda
and the developments in incomes policy as well as public sector non-interest
expenditures on inflation and inflation expectations are carefully evaluated. Within
this framework, the Committee assessed that meeting the medium term inflation
targets requires the maintenance of the tight policy stance.

25. Prudent monetary policy is necessary but not sufficient for achieving price
stability. The role of fiscal policy and structural reforms are also critical in this
process. Developments in structural reforms that would enhance the quality of
fiscal discipline are closely monitored both in terms of macroeconomic stability
and price stability. The European Union accession process and the sustained
implementation of the structural reforms envisaged in the economic program also
remain to be of concern. Continued determination in implementing the decisive
steps taken in these areas in recent years will strengthen the resilience of the
economy against possible changes in the global economy.
