The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short
term interest rates as follows:
a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) was kept constant at 7 percent,
b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate was reduced from 5.75 percent to
1.75 percent, while lending rate was kept constant at 8.75 percent. The interest
rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions
was kept constant at 7.75 percent.
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.):
Borrowing rate was reduced from 1.75 percent to 0 percent, while lending rate
was kept at 11.75 percent.
Recent data releases suggest that economic activity continues to recover with
the support of domestic demand. However, it would take a long time before industrial
capacity utilization rates return to their pre-crisis levels, due to weak external demand
outlook. Although employment conditions continue to improve, unemployment rates
remain at high levels. Therefore, it is expected that inflation would be on a declining
path in the forthcoming period, while core inflation indicators would remain consistent
with the medium-term targets.
In light of these assessments, the Committee has reiterated that it would be
necessary to maintain the policy rate at current levels for some time, and to keep it at
low levels for a long period.
Recent surge in capital inflows exacerbates the divergence between the growth
rates of domestic and external demand, widening the current account deficit through
rapid credit growth and increasing import demand and thus highlighting the risks
regarding financial stability. In order to encourage the lengthening of the maturities in
the Turkish lira money market transactions, the Committee has decided to allow
overnight interest rates to diverge from the policy rate temporarily, when needed. To this
end, the Committee has decided to widen the gap between lending and borrowing rates
by reducing the borrowing rates by 400 basis points. Moreover, observing the favorable
developments in credit conditions, the Committee has indicated that it would be
appropriate to proceed with the remaining measures outlined in the exit strategy.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation
outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within
eight working days.
