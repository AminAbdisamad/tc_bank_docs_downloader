PRESS RELEASE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE
INTERBANK MONEY MARKET, BANKS’ BORROWING LIMITS IN THE
INTERBANK MONEY MARKET AND LIQUIDITY FACILITIES OFFERED TO
PRIMARY DEALER BANKS

1. “Implementation Instructions for the Interbank Money Market” booklet dated
February 2000 has been updated in order to include the current
implementation instructions that were sent to banks on various dates following
its issue date and the changes made to the current implementations. The
changes in the implementation instructions will become effective as of July 9,
2007. The fundamental changes in the implementation instructions for the
Interbank Money Market (IMM) operations are as follows:
i) In order to support banks’ liquidity management and enhance the
effectiveness and flexibility of the payment system, Late Liquidity
Window (LON) operations that are conducted between 4 p.m.– 4:30
p.m. currently will be carried out between 4 p.m.– 5 p.m. on business
days and between 4 p.m. – 5:15 p.m. on the last business day of the
reserve maintenance period..
ii) The minimum transaction limit for YTL deposit and LON transactions
has been increased to YTL 100.000 and multiples from YTL 50.000 and
multiples; while the minimum transaction limit for Intra-Day Liquidity
Facility (IDLF) transactions has been decreased to YTL 100.000 and
multiples from YTL 250.000 and multiples.
iii) Gold deposits, which are among the collateral types but not actively
used, will no longer be accepted as collateral due to the difficulties in
implementation.
iv) Central Bank Liquidity Bills will be accepted as collateral too.
v) In order to facilitate the collateral management of banks, government
securities shall be accepted as collateral until one business day prior to
their maturity date, instead of three working days.

2. To enhance the Central Bank’s flexibility and efficiency of liquidity
management and to encourage widespread utilization of the liquidity facilities
of the Bank by the banking system, the total borrowing limit allocated to banks
in the IMM has been increased. However, the liquidity facility offered to
primary dealer banks within the framework of open market operations has
been reduced. Considering the increase in the asset growth of the banking
system between the years 2003 - 2006, the IMM total borrowing limit of the
banking system, which was latest set on July 22, 2004, has almost been
doubled to be effective as of July 9, 2007. The limit allocated to the banks is
determined according to the share of their assets in the aggregate banking
system. On the other hand, the unlimited borrowing facility provided to banks
against adequate collateral from the LON quota announced at O/N maturity in
line with the Central Bank’s lender of the last resort function will continue.
3. As indicated in the press release dated September 03, 2002, the CBRT
provides liquidity facility for the primary dealer banks in order to support the
primary dealership system. Considering the increase of the borrowing limit
provided for the banking system in the IMM with the aim of securing a wider
utilization of the CBRT liquidity facilities for the banking system, the liquidity
facility provided to primary dealer banks is revised as follows to be effective
from the beginning of the new primary dealership term (September 03, 2007):
i)

The total amount of liquidity facility provided for the primary
dealer banks has been decreased to 7 percent from 10 percent of
the outstanding Turkish lira denominated Treasury securities
purchased from Treasury auctions (including the net amount of
the Turkish lira denominated securities purchased from auctions,
public offerings, TAP sales, noncompetitive sales and switching
auctions and excluding FX indexed securities). Primary dealer
banks will continue to use the liquidity facility in the form of O/N
or one-week repo transactions at any time, between10 a.m – 4
p.m, as currently in practice.

ii)

The amount of government securities, which a primary dealer
bank is authorized to sell, has been reduced from 50 percent to
40 percent of its total liquidity facility. In using government
securities selling facility the following principles shall apply:

a) The banks in need of liquidity shall inform the CBRT about their
demands for selling benchmark government securities.
b) The CBRT shall contact with other primary dealer banks and
may preferably announce auctions for the government security
or securities that it deems appropriate. CBRT, if necessary,
may use the quotation method.
c) In this framework, the maximum daily amount of government
securities that the CBRT can buy shall not exceed 20 percent
of the total selling facility.
d) While the repo facility for primary dealer banks is automatically
available, the CBRT might disregard primary dealer banks’
demands for selling government securities, if there is enough
liquidity in the government securities secondary market and/or
there is no liquidity shortage in the market.
e) When a bank uses government securities selling facility, the
total liquidity and government security selling facility shall be
reduced as much as the amount of government securities sold.
