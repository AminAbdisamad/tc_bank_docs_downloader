DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Meeting Date: February 14, 2008
Committee Members
Durmuş Yılmaz (Governor), Erdem Başçı, Burhan Göklemez, M. İbrahim Turhan, Mehmet
Yörükoğlu.
The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) decided to lower the policy rates
as follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate from 15.50 to 15.25 percent, and lending rate
from 19.50 to 19.25 percent,
b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate applied between 4:00 p.m. –
5:00 p.m. from 11.50 to 11.25 percent, lending rate from 22.50 to 22.25 percent,
c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for
primary dealers via repo transactions from 18.50 to 18.25 percent.
Recent readings on economic activity suggest that the economy continues to
grow at a moderate pace. Weakened global credit conditions restrain domestic demand.
Moreover, the expected slowdown in global economic activity may lead to a reduction in
the contribution of external demand to the economic growth in the medium term.
Accordingly, aggregate demand conditions will continue to support disinflation. In this
context, inflation is expected to decelerate in the medium term despite risks from food
and energy prices.
The Committee underlined that the primary goal of the Central Bank of Turkey
(CBT) is to achieve price stability, and noted that monetary policy remains restrictive
even after the recent rate cuts. Although unprocessed food prices may display
temporary fluctuations, inflation excluding energy and food items is expected to remain
close to 4 percent. Yet, ongoing uncertainties in the global economy and the risks to the
price setting behavior compel the CBT to be attentive to the incoming information.
Accordingly, the Committee will closely monitor the lagged impacts of the recent rate
cuts. Besides, the second round effects on the wage and price setting behavior of
elevated food and energy prices and of the developments in incomes policy will be
watched closely. The timing of further easing will depend on developments regarding
global market conditions, external demand, fiscal policy implementation, and other
factors affecting the medium term inflation outlook.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation
outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within
eight working days.
