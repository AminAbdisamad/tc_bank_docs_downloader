PRESS RELEASE
ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE INTERVENTION OF THE
CENTRAL BANK
The Central Bank has announced through several press releases that, under the
floating exchange rate regime, the level of exchange rate is determined by
supply and demand conditions in the markets, but still the volatility in the
exchange rate has been closely observed, and that the Central Bank may directly
intervene in the markets in the event of an excessive volatility that might occur
in both directions. In this context, the Central Bank directly intervened in the
foreign exchange markets in 2002, namely on 11th of July and 24th of December
by selling foreign currency and on 2nd of December by buying foreign currency,
due to the excessive volatility in exchange rates.
There has recently been an excessive volatility in exchange rates, especially as
of end April, due to the ending of Iraq war and investorsâ€™ tendency toward
Turkish lira investment instruments as well as the upsurge in FX selling because
of the need for Turkish lira liquidity, resulting from tax payments and lack of
foreign exchange demand. Favorable expectations created by inflation figures
announced on 3rd of May and the successful borrowing of the Treasury over the
amounts to be redeemed has contributed to the reduction in excess TL liquidity.
Hence, the Central Bank has directly intervened in the markets today by buying
foreign currency in order to dampen excess volatility. As in all other
interventions in both directions, this intervention should not be interpreted as a
concern of the Central Bank about the actual level of exchange rates.
Moreover, the Central Bank has initiated to hold foreign exchange buying
auctions as of 6th of May due to the excess foreign exchange supply that started
at the end of February 2003. The purpose here is to strengthen the international
reserve position in a way not to contradict with the floating exchange rate
system and without disrupting the long-term trend and natural equilibrium of
exchange rate. In this framework, the Central Bank will continue to conduct
foreign exchange buying auctions within the principles stated in our
announcement of May 5, 2003.
