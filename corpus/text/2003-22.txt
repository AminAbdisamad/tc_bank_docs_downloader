PRESS RELEASE 
ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE INTERVENTION  OF THE 
CENTRAL BANK 
 
The Central Bank has announced through several pres s releases that, under the 
floating exchange rate regime, the level of exchang e rate is determined by 
supply and demand conditions in the markets, but st ill the volatility in the 
exchange rate has been closely observed, and that t he Central Bank may directly 
intervene in the markets in the event of an excessi ve volatility that might occur 
in both directions. In this context, the Central Ba nk directly intervened in the 
foreign exchange markets in 2002, namely on 11 th  of July and 24th of December 
by selling foreign currency and on 2 nd  of December by buying foreign currency, 
due to the excessive volatility in exchange rates. 
There has recently been an excessive volatility in exchange rates, especially as 
of end April, due to the ending of Iraq war and inv estorsâ€™ tendency toward 
Turkish lira investment instruments as well as the upsurge in FX selling because 
of the need for Turkish lira liquidity, resulting f rom tax payments and lack of 
foreign exchange demand. Favorable expectations cre ated by inflation figures 
announced on 3 rd  of May and the successful borrowing of the Treasur y over the 
amounts to be redeemed has contributed to the reduc tion in excess TL liquidity. 
Hence, the Central Bank has directly intervened in the markets today by buying 
foreign currency in order to dampen excess volatili ty. As in all other 
interventions in both directions, this intervention  should not be interpreted as a 
concern of the Central Bank about the actual level of exchange rates. 
Moreover, the Central Bank has initiated to hold fo reign exchange buying 
auctions as of 6 th  of May due to the excess foreign exchange supply t hat started 
at the end of February 2003. The purpose here is to  strengthen the international 
reserve position in a way not to contradict with th e floating exchange rate 
system and without disrupting the long-term trend a nd natural equilibrium of 
exchange rate. In this framework, the Central Bank will continue to conduct 
foreign exchange buying auctions within the princip les stated in our 
announcement of May 5, 2003.
