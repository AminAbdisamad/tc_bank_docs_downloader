The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to adjust the short
term interest rates as follows:
a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) has been kept at 5.75 percent,
b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate has been kept at 5 percent while
lending rate has been increased from 9 percent to 12,5 percent. Interest rate on
borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been
increased from 8 percent to 12 percent,
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.):
Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent while lending rate has been increased
from 12 percent to 15,5 percent.
Recent data releases suggest that the rebalancing between the domestic and
external demand is ongoing as envisaged. With the credit growth decelerating to more
reasonable levels, the desired increase in private savings has already started to take
place. Accordingly, the Committee has noted that there is a significant improvement in
the current account balance and this trend will be more evident in the final quarter of the
year.
Inflation will rise significantly in the upcoming months due to the recent excessive
depreciation of the Turkish lira, base effects from unprocessed food prices and the
recent adjustments in administered prices. The Committee will not tolerate these
developments to have an adverse impact on medium term inflation expectations and
inflation outlook. In this respect, the Committee has decided to widen the interest rate
corridor by increasing the lending rate significantly.
Moreover, in line with the strategy formulated at the interim meeting of August 4,
2011, the Committee will continue to monitor global developments closely and take the
needed measures promptly to maintain the stability in the domestic financial markets.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the
Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within
five working days.
