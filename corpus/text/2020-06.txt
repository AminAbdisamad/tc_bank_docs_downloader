As stipulated in Article 42 of the Central Bank Law No. 1211, if the inflation target is not 
attained, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) is accountable for reporting to the 
Government and announcing to the public the reasons for the deviation from the inflation target and 
the necessary measures to be taken . As stated in the main policy document “Monetary and Exchange 
Rate Policy for 2019”, which was published on 5 December 2018, the inflation target for 2019 was kept at 5% as per the agreement  reached with the Government . On the other hand, it was specified  
that in cases of significant deviations from the inflation target, updated forecasts in Inflation Reports 
would serve as  reference for the path that the inflation would follow while  converging to the target 
over the medium term. Along  this path, the first  objective is to  bring inflation  down to single digit s, 
and then gradually reduce inflation further to stabilize it around 5%. In the same document, it was 
also indicated that the CBRT would write an open letter to the  Government should the year -end 
inflation falls outside the uncertainty band of two percentage points around the target in either 
direction . The year -end inflation stood above the uncertainty band in 2019. This document 
elaborates on the reasons for the deviation of inflation from the target a nd explains the measures 
already taken, and to be taken, to bring inflation back on track with the target.  
Factors Affecting Inflation in 2019  
At end -2019, consumer inflation decreased  year-on-year by 8.5 points to 11.8% , below the 
forecast of 14.6% announced at the beginning of the year,  but it remained outside the uncertainty 
band. This was mainly driven by the weakened but persisting  lagged effects of the Turkish lira 
depreciation in 2018 on consumer prices , and by the impact of  the elevated level of inflation on 
wages and prices reflected through the backward -indexation channel . In addition, , administered

price adjustments in the energy group due to cost factors and the withdrawal of tax cuts on durable 
goods also had an  upward effect on inflation . As a matter of fact, despite the curbing effects of the 
sliding -scale tariff, energy prices increased  by 11.0% in 2019 due to price adjustments in electricity 
and natural gas in the second half of the year . 
Food prices constituted another factor causing inflation to remain above the medium -term 
target . Although unprocessed food inflation decelerated in the second half of the year on the back 
of favorable supply conditions, annual food inflation was realized as  10.9% by the end of the year 
due to costs accumulated particularly in  the processed food group.  
Annual inflation in services, where backward indexation and thus inflation inertia are much 
stronger, remained elevated due to real unit labor costs, buoyant tourism demand and the course of  
food prices, ending 2019 at 12.3%. Another upward pressure on consumer inflation was the 43.1% 
hike in prices of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products . This upsurge contributed 1.8 points to 
annual inflation. 
In sum, with stability in Turkish lira, the mild course of  domestic demand conditions  and 
import prices , as well as  the improvement in inflation expectations, consumer inflation fell sharply 
in 2019 but was still above the medium -term target.  
Measures Taken to Reach the Inflation Target  
In 2019, the CBR T determined  its monetary stance by taking into account the underlying 
inflation  trend indicators, and set the extent  of monetary tightness to ensure that disinflation  is 
sustainable  and the actual path of inflation is consistent with the targeted path . Thus, the CBRT’s 
inflation forecasts and the underlying trends implied by these forecasts played an important role in 
the Bank’s decision- making process. In the first half of 2019, the Bank kept the one -week repo rate 
at 24% and took a number of steps re garding liquidity management. A tight monetary policy stance 
focused on bringing inflation down and a strong policy coordination brought stability to the Turkish 
lira. Therefore, the accumulated effects of exchange rates decreased and domestic demand displ ayed 
a moderate course , all leading to a significant improvement in inflation dynamics. In view of an 
improved inflation outlook, the Bank started cutting rates in July, bringing the policy rate gradually 
down to 11.25% with the 75 basis -point -cut in Janua ry 2020 (Chart 1).

The CBRT continued to broaden its set of tools  other than the policy rate, to ensure the 
effective functioning of markets and the transmission mechanism in the face of financial market 
volatility and unhealthy price formations . Accordin gly, to alleviate the adverse effects of supply and 
demand imbalances  in offshore swap markets in the last week of March, the Bank gradually raised 
the total limit of outstanding swap transactions (where the CBRT buys FX on spot market and sells 
FX at matu rity) at the Turkish Lira Currency Swap Market. The Bank’s swap facilities have been 
used extensively by banks. In this regard, since the majority of the system’s funding need has been  
met by the CBRT’s swap facilities, fund ing through open market transact ions (OMO) has gradually 
decreased (Chart 2).

In 2019, funding via OMO was mostly done by one -week repo auctions, however these  repo 
auctions were suspended twice over the year due to the developments in the financial markets. T he 
entire CBRT funding was carried out over the CBRT overnight lending rat e during these periods , 
and overnight repo rates at the BIST converged to the upper bound of the CBRT  interest rate 
corridor . To support the Primary Dealership System in view of its contributions to the deepening of 
financial markets and the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission mechanism, the Primary 
Dealer (PD) facility that allows banks to obtain liquidity within the framework of the Open Market 
operations (OMO) was  re-introduced on 17 June 2019. 6810121416182022242601.18

In 2019, occasional fluctuations in financial markets stemming from geopolitical 
developments waned considerably thanks to the effective use of the CBRT’s comprehensive tool 
set as well as coordinated steps. The country  risk premium that receded due to the widespread 
improvement in inflation expectations,  recovering economic activity and global developments 
brought down long term interest rates . Easing  in domestic funding conditions , on the back of 
improved inflation outlook and policy rate cuts , have been largely transmitted to loan rates.  
Inflation outlook continue s to improve and inflation expectations sustain  their wide -spread 
decline. The improvement in macroeconomic indicators, inflation in particular, supports the fall in 
country  risk premium and helps contain cost pressures. Developments in the  exchange rate, 
domestic demand conditions and producer prices contribute to a mild trend in core inflation indicators. The course of inflation is considered to be broadly in line with the year -end inflation 
projection for 2020.  
Under a tight monetary pol icy stance and strong policy coordination focused on bringing 
inflation down, inflation is projected to converge gradually to the targets. Accordingly, inflation is 
projected to be 8.2% at the end of 2020 and then fall to 5.4% at the end of 2021, before st abilizing 
around 5% in the medium -term. Thus, with a 70% probability, inflation is expected to be between 
6.2% and 10.2% (with a mid -point of 8.2%) at end -2020 and between 3.0% and 7.8% (with a mid-
point of 5.4%) at end- 2021 (Chart 3).  
In an outlook where global financial conditions will remain mild in 2020 and the recent 
improvement seen in the country risk premium w ill continue in the upcoming period, it is expected 
that financial conditions would support domestic demand and economic activity, but aggrega te 
demand conditions would not be inflationary . Maintaining a sustained disinflation pr ocess is a key 
factor for achieving lower country  risk, lower long -term interest rates, and a stronger economic 
recovery. Strong policy coordination that will help reduc e the backward indexation behavior and 
lower medium -term inflation expectations consistent with the forecasts and targets are k ey for 
success in disinflation.

Conclusion  
Consumer inflation, which materialized at 20.3% at end -2018 due to exchange rate 
developments and the deterioration in pricing behavior, declined by 8.5 points to 11.8% in 2019. In 
addition to the monetary policy actions, the economic  program focusi ng on macroeconomic 
rebalancing contributed to the significant improvement in the underlying trend of inflation, 
expectations and pricing behavior . 
The downtrend in the medium -term infla tion expectations continues to be widespread and 
the distribution of expectations implies an increased consensus among survey participants, which 
indicates that uncertainties regarding the medium- term inflation outlook have significantly 
decreased . Neverth eless , medium -term inflation expectations still hover above the medium -term 
target and keep risks to price stability alive.  
Keeping the disinflation process on track with the targeted path requires the continuation of 
a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, monetary stance will be determined by considering the 
indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. 
The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial 
stability objectives.  -6-2261014182212.18

To support the effectiveness of the monetary policy and minimize the inflation -growth trade -
off, it is crucial  that macro -financial policies focus on reducing the risk premium s and further 
improving the predictability of the  macro policy  outlook. A resolute continuation of the coordination 
between monetary and  fiscal policies  will contribute to achieving price stability and financial 
stability  objectives . Accordingly, it is anticipated that the confidence channel and the cred it channel 
will support the economic recovery, while  inflation will remai n on track with the targeted path in 
the upcoming period.  
Continued structural steps focusing on reducing rigidity and volatility in inflation will 
contribute to price stability and therefore social welfare. In this context, the CBRT will maintain its 
efforts to analyze structural factors, develop policy recommend ation s and raise awareness of the 
importance of disinflation among related stakeholders and the public.
