SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: February 19, 2009
Inflation Developments
1. Consumer prices increased by 0.29 percent in January, and inflation dropped
to 9.50 percent year-on-year. Exchange rate pass-through remained low
owing to the marked slowdown in economic activity, while easing oil and other
commodity prices continued to help bring inflation down.
2. Unprocessed food prices continued to rise whereas processed food inflation
remained on the decline. Unprocessed food price inflation is expected to ease
in the short run due to favorable weather conditions and weak foreign demand.
On the processed food prices front, annual inflation is expected to remain on a
downward path in the first half of 2009. Accordingly, food prices will continue
to contribute to disinflation in the coming months.
3. Annual energy price inflation dropped by a cumulative 16 points to 15.02
percent in the last three months on falling oil and other commodity prices.
Energy price inflation will continue to fall with the reduction in natural gas rates
in February, which will have around 0.3 percentage points downward
contribution to inflation.
4. Annual inflation in goods excluding energy and food increased by 1 point to
4.74 percent in January. After displaying a sharp drop in December due to
early seasonal discounts, clothing prices decreased at a less marked pace in
January than in previous year, pushing the groupâ€™s annual inflation up in
January. Meanwhile, the ongoing weakening in economic activity continued to
mitigate the exchange rate pass-through on prices of durable goods.
Accordingly durable goods inflation increased only slightly to an annual rate of
3.46 percent in January.
5. Inflation in services declined to 9.89 percent in January. The significant
slowdown in annual services inflation suggests a downward course in the
underlying inflation trend. Plunging world oil prices have brought transport
inflation down, while weaker domestic demand and lower food prices have had
a favorable impact on catering prices. Rent inflation eased further in January.
Given the continued softening in domestic demand, annual inflation in services
is expected to moderate further.

6. Overall, the Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) expects inflation to
decelerate at a faster pace in the coming months, thanks to the fall in
underlying inflation and the favorable base effect.
Factors Affecting Inflation
7. Recent readings suggest that economic activity continues to weaken.
Industrial production, which has been on the fall in seasonally adjusted terms
since July, displayed a sharp contraction in the final quarter. Readings on
capacity utilization and other key indicators point to a further decline in
industrial production in January.
8. Readings on the labor market confirm the sharp weakening of economic
activity. In the fourth quarter of 2008, non-farm employment fell quarterly on a
seasonally adjusted basis, and non-farm unemployment surged rapidly. The
fall in non-farm employment can be attributed not only to the slowdown in
overall economic activity but also to the sectoral shock driven by the sharp
decline in exports. The number of people receiving unemployment benefits
increased markedly in January, suggesting that the rise in unemployment
accelerated in early 2009. In light of these assessments, the Committee noted
that non-farm unemployment might display a historic high in the first quarter.
9. Recent readings indicate that although consumer sentiment has shown signs
of recovery, it has remained low by historical standards. Automobiles sales
displayed a contraction in annual terms since June, whereas they increased in
December and January in seasonally adjusted terms. Consumption indices
followed a similar pattern, showing a slight recovery in January. The
deterioration in consumer confidence stopped in December-January period,
while housing and personal loans have displayed signs of recovery recently.
However, the Committee noted that it would be too early to make a conclusive
statement whether these indicators point to a long lasting recovery.
10. Indicators for investment demand continued to display a weak course.
Production and imports of capital goods dropped dramatically in the final
quarter of 2008, both in annual and quarterly terms. The Committee indicated
that the recovery in investment spending would take time, given the historically
low capacity utilization rates.
11. Industrial production indexes in advanced economies registered a sizable drop
in December and foreign demand remained weak on slower global growth.
Accordingly, the export quantity index continued to fall in December, posting a
steep quarterly drop in the fourth quarter of 2008. Nominal export figures on
January and February suggests that the weakening of foreign demand
continued into the first quarter.

Monetary Policy and Risks
12. Problems in international credit markets and the global economy persist, while
new information lead to further downward revisions in the forecasts for global
economic outlook. Uncertainties regarding the impact of the problems in
financial markets on the real economy remain high. In this context, domestic
and foreign demand are expected to stay weak in the near term, and thus it
will take some time for the economic activity to recover. Therefore, downward
pressures on inflation are expected to prevail.
13. The Committee indicated that the recovery in credit would be slow, reflecting
tight financial conditions both in domestic and external terms. Besides,
disposal income growth is expected to remain subdued, given the moderating
employment growth and weakening labor market conditions. Therefore, the
recovery in domestic demand is expected to be gradual and slow, which is
also supported by the recent readings on domestic economic activity.
14. The fall in oil and other commodity prices are having a favorable impact on
inflation, and thus contributing to the decline in inflation expectations.
Recently, survey based medium term inflation expectations have been lower
than the inflation targets. The Committee expects a rapid deceleration in
inflation in the short term with more significant contribution of easing energy
and food inflation. This should also bring down inflation expectations further.
15. Looking ahead, it is anticipated that developments in both the aggregate
demand conditions and the real marginal costs will drive down inflation
significantly in the forthcoming period, bringing inflation to the target levels
sooner than envisaged. Judging that inflation is likely to undershoot the target
significantly at the end of the year, the Committee decided to lower short-term
interest rates by 150 basis points. In line with the baseline scenario at the
January Inflation Report, the Committee stated that the amount of the next
rate cut would likely be less than the current one and reiterated that the extent
and the timing of a possible future rate cut would depend on the factors
affecting the inflation outlook.
16. Business loan rates have responded less to the policy rate cuts compared to
the consumer loan rates. Accordingly, the spread between business loan rates
and the policy rates have remained at significantly high levels. In this respect,
the Committee indicated that the tightness in financial conditions still persist to
some degree, notwithstanding the recent policy rate cuts. Credit supply
remains tight and a significant part of the credit demand by firms can be
attributed to debt restructuring. Therefore, the role of the credit channel in
facilitating economic activity remains limited. Developments in credit markets
are closely monitored as a coincident indicator for economic activity and also
in terms of their importance for the transmission of monetary policy.

17. It is worth to mention that a critical assumption underlying the inflation and
monetary policy outlook outlined above is that government fiscal stance will
remain neutral in cyclically adjusted terms. In other words, the baseline
scenario envisages that government expenditures will evolve in line with the
official projections, while tax revenues will moderate as implied by the cyclical
downturn. Any significant deviation from this framework may lead to a revision
in the outlook for inflation and monetary policy.
18. The Central Bank will continue to take the necessary measures to contain the
adverse effects of the global financial turmoil on the domestic economy,
provided that they do not conflict with the price stability objective. In this
context, the Committee underscored the importance of maintaining the smooth
functioning of the financial system and the efficient operation of credit markets,
and reached a consensus on implementing additional measures regarding the
foreign exchange liquidity.
19. Prudent monetary policy is necessary but not sufficient to maintain the
resilience of the economy against the global crisis, especially under current
conditions. The Committee noted that the rise in the public sector borrowing
requirement throughout the year 2009 could undermine the effectiveness of
monetary policy by weakening the impact of policy decisions over the longer
end of the yield curve. Strengthening the commitment to fiscal discipline and
structural reform agenda is critical for facilitating expectations management
and also for enhancing the simulative impact of the monetary accommodation.
In this respect, commitment to the European Union accession process, and
timely implementation and revision of the structural reforms envisaged in the
Medium Term Program remain to be of utmost importance.
