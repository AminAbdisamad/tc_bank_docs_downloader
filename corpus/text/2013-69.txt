The monthly maximum contractual and overdue interes t rates to be applied to credit 
card transactions, which were set with the CBRT Com muniqué No. 2013/11 on the 
Amendment to the Communiqué on Maximum Interest Rat es To Be Applied To Credit Card 
Transactions published in the Official Gazette No: 28765 dated 14 September 2013 and 
which took effect as of 1 October 2013, are left un changed. The rates will continue to be 
valid for the 3-month period starting on 1 January 2014. 
Accordingly, the monthly maximum contractual intere st rate to be applied to credit 
card transactions during the period between 1 Janua ry 2014 and 31 March 2014 is set at 
2.02 percent for the Turkish lira, 1.70 percent for  the US dollar and 1.64 percent for the 
Euro, whereas the monthly overdue interest rate is set at 2.52 percent for the Turkish lira, 
2.20 percent for the US dollar and 2.14 percent for  the Euro. 
As of 1 January 2014, the contractual and overdue i nterest rates to be applied by 
banks to credit card transactions will not exceed t he above mentioned maximum rates. 
Banks are free to determine their respective rates at their own discretion provided that they 
are below the ceiling rates. The maximum contractua l and overdue interest rates, which will 
be valid for the 3-month period starting on 1 April  2014, will be announced by the CBRT 
prior to this date.  
Banks in Turkey, as in other countries, set the cre dit card interest rates higher than 
the interest rates on consumer loans. Therefore, th e CBRT advises credit card holders to 
prefer consumer loans rather than personal credit c ards to meet their short-term credit 
needs.
