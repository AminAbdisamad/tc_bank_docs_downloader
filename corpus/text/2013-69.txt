PRESS RELEASE ON THE MAXIMUM INTEREST RATES TO BE APPLIED TO CREDIT
CARD TRANSACTIONS

The maximum interest rates to be applied to credit card transactions have not been
changed.
The monthly maximum contractual and overdue interest rates to be applied to credit
card transactions, which were set with the CBRT Communiqué No. 2013/11 on the
Amendment to the Communiqué on Maximum Interest Rates To Be Applied To Credit Card
Transactions published in the Official Gazette No: 28765 dated 14 September 2013 and
which took effect as of 1 October 2013, are left unchanged. The rates will continue to be
valid for the 3-month period starting on 1 January 2014.
Accordingly, the monthly maximum contractual interest rate to be applied to credit
card transactions during the period between 1 January 2014 and 31 March 2014 is set at
2.02 percent for the Turkish lira, 1.70 percent for the US dollar and 1.64 percent for the
Euro, whereas the monthly overdue interest rate is set at 2.52 percent for the Turkish lira,
2.20 percent for the US dollar and 2.14 percent for the Euro.
As of 1 January 2014, the contractual and overdue interest rates to be applied by
banks to credit card transactions will not exceed the above mentioned maximum rates.
Banks are free to determine their respective rates at their own discretion provided that they
are below the ceiling rates. The maximum contractual and overdue interest rates, which will
be valid for the 3-month period starting on 1 April 2014, will be announced by the CBRT
prior to this date.
Banks in Turkey, as in other countries, set the credit card interest rates higher than
the interest rates on consumer loans. Therefore, the CBRT advises credit card holders to
prefer consumer loans rather than personal credit cards to meet their short-term credit
needs.
