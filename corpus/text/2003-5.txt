PRESS RELEASE
ON THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE VOLUMES
OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS AGAINST TURKISH LIRA
MADE BY BANKS AND SPECIAL FINANCE INSTITUTIONS
Monitoring of the financial markets is among the Central Bank’s main duties by Law.
Under the framework of its Law, the Central Bank closely observes the foreign exchange
market, as well as the other financial markets. Monitoring of the foreign exchange market is
considered crucial for taking the necessary regulatory measures to ensure that the market
could operate efficiently in full agreement with the principles of the floating exchange-rate
regime. In this regard, a monitoring system was initiated by the Central Bank in 2002 to better
oversee the volumes and types of transactions in the foreign exchange market and it was
announced by the Press Release dated January 2, 2002 that the information on the depth of the
foreign exchange markets would be regularly announced to the public, once the monitoring
system starts providing reliable results.
In this context, starting today, the data on the volumes of foreign exchange, banknotes
and forward foreign exchange buying and selling transactions performed by the banks, which
are established in Turkey, or are operating in Turkey through branch offices, and the special
finance institutions will be published regularly on the Central Bank Website
(www.tcmb.gov.tr) under the heading of “CBRT Data/Financial Markets”.
Transaction volumes are on a daily basis and will be published after five working days
following the transaction date. In addition, transaction volumes for the period of October 1,
2002 - January 10, 2003 have also been published. The transaction volumes are recorded in
US dollars, and grouped as foreign exchange and banknotes. The data on the foreign
exchange transactions are classified under three headings, as domestic interbank, domestic
customers and customers abroad. A distinction between spot and forward foreign exchange
transactions is also made. Clarifications about the contents of the data can be found in the
table footnotes.
