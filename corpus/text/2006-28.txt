The Monetary Policy Committee has decided to keep short-term interest rates
(policy rates) unchanged at the CBRT Interbank Money Market and the Istanbul
Stock Exchange Repo-Reverse Repo Market as follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: The CBRT borrowing interest rate is 15 percent
and the CBRT lending interest rate is 18 percent.
b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Within the framework of the Late
Liquidity Window Facility, the CBRT overnight borrowing interest rate applicable
between 4:00 p.m. – 4:30 p.m. at Interbank Money Market is 11 percent and lending
interest rate is 21 percent.
c) The interest rates applicable to overnight and one-week maturity borrowing
facilities provided for primary dealer banks via repo transactions within the
framework of open market transactions are 17 percent.
The Committee perceives that there has been no significant change in the
medium-term inflation outlook since the last meeting held on 7 June 2006. It is
considered that the rise in annual inflation due to recent volatility of exchange rate
may continue also in June and July. However, it is expected that the indirect effects of
exchange rate movements on the inflation will remain contained along with the slowdown in domestic demand in the following months. Moreover, the fact that the
adverse impact of factors that are beyond the control of monetary policy on inflation
are likely to ease in the next period indicates that the downward trend in annual
inflation could begin before 2007.
In line with these assessments, the policy stance adopted in the earlier meeting
has been preserved. Hence, policy decisions will be based on a perspective in which
inflation would converge to the target towards the end of 2007. In this framework, our
outlook is based on anticipated downward trend of policy rates, accompanied by the
envisioned decline in inflation in the medium-term.
In light of currently available information, the policy rates are less likely to
rise than to stay stable in the short-term. However, it should be underlined that the
monetary policy will surely respond if there are strong indications that the inflation
could considerably deviate from the targets in the medium-term. In this context, in the
upcoming period, the developments that could disrupt medium-term expectations, the
international liquidity conditions, and the pricing behaviors will be closely monitored.

The Central Bank will not hesitate to adopt a tighter stance in the monetary policy, if
needed.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information associated with the
inflation outlook will potentially lead the Monetary Policy Committee to revise its
future stance.
A broader summary of the assessments of the Monetary Policy Committee
will be published within five working days.
