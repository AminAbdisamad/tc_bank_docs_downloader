The Monetary Policy Committee has decided  to  keep  short-term interest rates 
(policy rates)  unchanged at the CBRT Interbank Money Market and the Istanbul 
Stock Exchange Repo-Reverse Repo Market as follows:  
a) Overnight Interest Rates:  The CBRT borrowing interest rate is 15 percent 
and the CBRT lending interest rate is 18 percent .  
b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates:  Within the framework of the Late 
Liquidity Window Facility, the CBRT overnight borrowing interest rat e applicable 
between 4:00 p.m. – 4:30 p.m. at Interbank Money Market is 11 percent  and lending 
interest rate is 21 percent .  
c) The interest rates applicable to overnight and one-week maturity  borrowing 
facilities provided for primary dealer banks via repo transactions w ithin the 
framework of open market transactions are 17 percent . 
 The Committee perceives that there has been no significant change in the 
medium-term inflation outlook since the last meeting held on 7 June 2006. It  is 
considered that the rise in annual inflation due to recent volatility of exchange rate 
may continue also in June and July. However, it is expected that the i ndirect effects of 
exchange rate movements on the inflation will remain contained along with the slow-
down in domestic demand in the following months. Moreover, the fact that the  
adverse impact of factors that are beyond the control of monetary poli cy on inflation 
are likely to ease in the next period indicates that the downward t rend in annual 
inflation could begin before 2007. 
In line with these assessments, the policy stance adopted in the ea rlier meeting 
has been preserved. Hence, policy decisions will be based on a perspecti ve in which 
inflation would converge to the target towards the end of 2007. In this fra mework, our 
outlook is based on anticipated downward trend of policy rates, accompanied by  the 
envisioned decline in inflation in the medium-term. 
In light of currently available information, the policy rates are less likely to 
rise than to stay stable in the short-term. However, it should be under lined that the 
monetary policy will surely respond if there are strong indications  that the inflation 
could considerably deviate from the targets in the medium-term. In t his context, in the 
upcoming period, the developments that could disrupt medium-term expectations , the 
international liquidity conditions, and the pricing behaviors will be close ly monitored. The Central Bank will not hesitate to adopt a tighter stance in t he monetary policy, if 
needed. 
It should be emphasized that any new data or information associated wi th the 
inflation outlook will potentially lead the Monetary Policy Committe e to revise its 
future stance.  
A broader summary of the assessments of the Monetary Policy Comm ittee 
will be published within five working days.
