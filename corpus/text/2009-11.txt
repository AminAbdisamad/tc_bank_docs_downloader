Meeting Date: March 19, 2009
Committee Members

The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to lower the policy
rates as follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate is decreased from 11.50 percent to
10.50 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 14 percent to 13 percent,
b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate between 4:00 p.m. –
5:00 p.m. is decreased from 7.5 percent to 6.5 percent, while lending rate is
decreased from 17 percent to 16 percent,
c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities
provided for primary dealers via repo transactions is decreased from 13 percent
to 12 percent.
Recent data releases indicate that domestic economic activity continues to slow
down. Problems in international credit markets persist while forecasts of global
economic growth are consistently revised downwards, suggesting that the economic
activity is not likely to recover anytime soon. Therefore, downward pressures on inflation
are expected to continue. Moreover, ongoing declines in oil and other commodity prices
are having a favorable impact on disinflation. The Committee has noted that inflation
may display a temporary rise in March due to a sharp increase in unprocessed food
prices, before resuming its downward trend.
The Committee has indicated that the rate cuts have lowered the probability of
significantly undershooting the end-year inflation target. However, the tightness in
financial conditions still persists to some extent, and uncertainties regarding the impact
of the problems in financial markets on the real economy remain high, suggesting that
downside risks still remain. The Central Bank will continue to take the necessary
measures to contain the adverse effects of the global financial turmoil on the domestic
economy, provided that they do not conflict with the price stability objective. Looking
forward, the Committee envisages that the next rate cut may be measured, and that it
may be necessary for the monetary policy to maintain an easing bias for a considerable
period.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation
outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within
eight working days.
