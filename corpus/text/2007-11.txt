DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Meeting Date: May 14, 2007
Committee Members
Durmuş Yılmaz (Governor), Erdem Başçı, Burhan Göklemez, M. İbrahim Turhan,
Mehmet Yörükoğlu.

The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to keep shortterm interest rates (policy rates) unchanged as follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 17.50 percent, and lending rate at
22.50 percent,
b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate applied between 4:00 p.m. –
4:30 p.m. at 13.50 percent, lending rate at 25.50 percent,
c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided
for primary dealers via repo transactions at 21.50 percent.
Recent data on economic activity is broadly consistent with the outlook
presented in the April Inflation Report. While the slowdown in private consumption
demand continues, foreign demand remains relatively strong. Aggregate demand
conditions continue to support disinflation. Against this background, disinflation is
expected to become more significant in the upcoming period. Besides, the
Committee noted that a partial correction in unprocessed food prices, and the base
effect may contribute to the decline in annual inflation in May. However, the
Committee, with a medium term perspective, decided to keep the policy rates
unchanged against the risks such as the gap between inflation expectations and
targets, the backward looking pricing behavior, elevated oil prices, prevailing
uncertainties, and the stickiness related to services price inflation.
The monetary tightening since June 2006 is affecting the domestic demand
as expected. The lagged effects on inflation are yet to be seen. The potential
impacts of the progress in the structural reform agenda and the developments in
incomes policy as well as public sector non-interest expenditures on inflation and
inflation expectations are carefully evaluated. Within this framework, the Committee
assesses that meeting the medium term inflation targets requires the maintenance
of the tight policy stance.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the
inflation outlook will lead the Committee to reconsider its stance.
A brief summary of the assessments of the Committee will be released within
eight working days.
