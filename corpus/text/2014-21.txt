Seminar on 12 April 2014 Saturday at 23.00 hours local time in Turkey.
Governor Başçı emphasized the following points:
• Retail loan growth continues to slow down in response to the tight monetary
policy stance, recent macroprudential measures, and weak capital flows.
• The impact of monetary tightening on inflation will be observed with some
lag. Meanwhile, inflation is expected to peak in May, partly reflecting the
base effects.

momentum.
• The current account deficit will improve substantially in 2014.
