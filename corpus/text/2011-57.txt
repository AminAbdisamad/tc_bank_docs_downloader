SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: November 23, 2011

Inflation Developments
1. In October, consumer prices were up 3.27 percent and annual inflation

climbed to 7.66 percent. October price developments were highlighted by
increases in administered prices, which contributed to the monthly inflation by
1.35 percentage points. While core goods inflation continued to increase
parallel to the exchange rate movements, the prices of services maintaineda
moderate course in this period.
2. Administered prices went up due to the tax hikes and adjustments in energy
prices. In this period, the Special Consumption Tax (SCT) rates were raised
on some motor vehicles, mobile phones, alcoholic beverages and tobacco
products. As foreseen, the largest contributor to inflation within SCT hikes
became tobacco products with 0.8 percentage points. Price adjustments in
energy due to the increases in electricity and natural gas tariffs added 0.5
percentage points to inflation. Moreover, it should be noted that the
adjustments in tobacco products will further contribute around 0.2 percentage
points to November inflation.
3. Despite an increase by 4.04 percent in the prices of food and alcoholic
beverages in October, annual inflation in this group continued to decline due
to the base effect in unprocessed food prices. Owing to the price increases in
fresh fruits and vegetables amid adverse weather conditions, unprocessed
food prices rose by 7.56 percent. On the processed food front, the rise in
annual inflation came to a halt in October. Due to the rapid increases in
unprocessed food prices and the base effects, annual food inflation is
expected to rise markedly during the last two months of the year.
4. Prices of services rose by 0.56 percent in October, and annual services
inflation went up to 6.63 percent. Seasonally adjusted data point to a
deceleration in services inflation. Annual core goods inflationcontinued to
increase in this period due to the ongoing exchange rate pass-through,
reaching 8.77 percent in October. This rise was attributed to durable goods
prices in particular. Meanwhile annual inflation went up in theclothing group as
well. Thus, the annual inflation of the core price indicators displayed an
increase, while the seasonally adjusted data exhibited a relatively milder trend.

Factors Affecting Inflation
5. Recent data releases point to a notable reduction in economic growth in the
second half of the year. Industrial production displayed a modest
growthconsistent with the slowing domestic demand and deteriorating global
outlook. Capacity utilization rates remained below the pre-crisis levels. The
Committee noted that global problems would continue to put a cap on the
industrial activity in the forthcoming period.
6. The final domestic demand continues to slowdown. The depreciation in the
Turkish Lira and recent tax adjustments coupled with the uncertainties
regarding the global economy, are expected to weaken the demand for
durable goods, particularly the sales of vehicles, in the forthcoming period.
Besides, the decline in consumer and investor confidence feed into this
downtrend.Moreover, the recent and notable slowdown in consumer loans
also supports this outlook.
7. The Committee indicated that the lagged effects of the policy measures
undertaken since November 2010 to rebalancethe domestic and external
demand would be more pronounced in the last quarter of the year.
Additionally, the restrictiveimpact of global problems on the externalfinancing
may contribute to the tightening in domestic lending conditions in the
forthcoming period. Besidesthe developments in credit conditions, thelow
levels in capacity utilization rates coupled with the mounting uncertainties in
demand pose a downward risk on investments. All these indicators signal that
the deceleration in domestic demand will continue.
8. External demand remains weak. Recent downward revision of medium-term
growth forecasts for the U.S. and the euro area points to a steadily worsening
outlook for the global economy. The Committee underlined that the outlook for
the world economy noticeably deteriorated compared to the first half of the
year and that global problems would continue to restrain foreign demand
notwithstanding the competitive advantage provided by the exchange rate
movements.
9. Parallel to the economic activity, the slowdown in seasonally adjusted nonfarm employment continued in August. Meanwhile, unemployment rates
declined owing to the fall in the labor force participation rate. Contrary to the
robust course in the construction sector, employment in services slowed down,
driven by trade, restaurants, hotels, transport and communication.
Employment in the industrial sector declined in this period, whereas leading

indicators point that global problems will continue to put a cap on the
employment conditions in the sector.

Risks and Monetary Policy
10. In light of these developments, the Committee has indicated that the
rebalancing between the domestic and external demand is ongoing as
envisaged. The rebalancing takes place through imports, as the external
demand remains weak due to prevailing problems regarding the global
economy. In fact, seasonally adjusted real imports data suggest to a slowdown
since the second quarter.
11. The Committee has underscored the key role of credits in the rebalancing
process. Recent slowdown in credit growth has been restraining the amount of
expenditures financed through borrowing. With the credit growth decelerating
to more reasonable levels, the desired increase in private savings has already
started to take place. Accordingly, the improvement in the current account
balance is expected to become more significant in the final months of the year.
12. The Committee has noted that inflation will display a rapid increase in the
short-term due to the base effects from unprocessed food prices. Base effect
will be stronger in November and inflation is expected to exceed the target
significantly at the end of the year. The Central Bank has delivered a strong
tightening in October in order to prevent the potential second round effects of
this development. The tightening is having an impact on credit and domestic
demand as of the final quarter. In this respect, domestic demand is expected
to follow a moderate path and second round effects of the temporary price
movements will be contained in the forthcoming periods.
13. The Committee members have emphasized the importance of having a
flexible monetary policy framework against the exceptionally high level of
uncertainty across global financial markets. Currently, active use of the
interest rate corridor through effective liquidity management provides the
required flexibility. In this context, monetary policy stance can be changed at a
daily frequency by adjusting the liquidity operations. The impact of the
measures undertaken on credit, domestic demand, and inflation expectations
will be monitored closely and the amount of Turkish lira funding via one-week
repo auctions will be timely adjusted on both sides, if needed.
14. Developments in the financial markets are monitored closely because of the
persisting uncertainty regarding global economy. Especially, ongoing concerns
on the sovereign debt dynamics in the euro area and the possibility of a
contagion to financial markets which would further deepen the global problems
emerge as a main risk factor. In line with the strategy formulated at the interim

meeting of August 4, 2011, the Committee will continue to monitor global
developments closely and take the needed measures promptly to maintain the
stability in the domestic financial markets.
15. Monetary policy will continue to focus on price stability while preserving
financial stability as a supplementary objective. To this end, the impact of the
macroprudential measures taken by the CBRT and other institutions on the
inflation outlook will be assessed carefully. Strengthening the commitment to
fiscal discipline and the structural reform agenda in the medium term would
support the relative improvement of Turkey’s sovereign risk, and thus facilitate
macroeconomic and price stability. Sustaining the fiscal discipline will also
provide more flexibility for monetary policy and support the social welfare by
keeping long term interest rates permanently at low levels. In this respect,
timely implementation of the structural reforms envisaged by the new Medium
Term Program remains to be of utmost importance.
