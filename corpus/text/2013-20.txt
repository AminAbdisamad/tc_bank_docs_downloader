The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to cut the short term
interest rates as follows:
a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) has been cut from 5 percent to 4.5 percent.
b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate has been cut from 4 percent to 3.5 percent
while lending rate has been cut from 7 percent to 6.5 percent. Interest rate on borrowing
facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been cut from 6.5
percent to 6 percent.
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing
rate has been kept at 0 percent while lending rate has been cut from 10 percent to 9.5
percent.
Recent data suggest that domestic and external demand are evolving in line with
expectations. Domestic demand follows a healthy recovery while exports slow down due to
weak global economic activity. The current policy framework and the decline in commodity
prices limit the impact of the increasing economic activity on the current account deficit.
Capital inflows remain strong and credit growth hovers above the reference rate. The
Committee indicated that, in order to balance the risks on financial stability, the proper policy
would be to keep interest rates low while increasing foreign currency reserves via
macroprudential measures. Accordingly, it was deemed appropriate to implement a measured
tightening via reserve requirements and reserve options coefficients, while delivering a cut in the
short term interest rates.
Ongoing uncertainties regarding the global economy and the volatility in capital flows
necessitate the monetary policy to remain flexible in both directions. Therefore, the impact of the
measures undertaken on credit, domestic demand, and inflation expectations will be monitored
closely and the funding amount will be adjusted in either direction, as needed.
The Committee has indicated that the weak global demand and the commodity price
outlook contain the upward pressures on inflation. In the meantime, the impact of increases in
credit and domestic demand on the pricing behavior will be monitored closely.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to
revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five
working days.
