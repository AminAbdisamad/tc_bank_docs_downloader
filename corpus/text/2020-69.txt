Press Release on Turkish Lira Liquidity
Management
19 November 2020, No: 2020-69
In order to simplify the operational framework of the monetary policy, starting from 20 November
2020, the funding currently provided by the Central Bank via traditional method repo auctions with
one month maturity and late liquidity window facilities will instead be provided via quantity repo
auctions with one-week maturity, which constitute the principal monetary policy tool of the Central
Bank. Within the scope of liquidity management operations, to limit the volatility that may occur in
the secondary market overnight interest rates and to ensure a balanced distribution of liquidity
among different days of the week, for a one-week transition period, the overnight lending interest
rate will be set as the policy rate of 15% from 20 November 2020 to 26 November 2020 (including
these dates).
During this transition period and afterwards, banks will be able to borrow at the Central Bank
overnight lending interest rate from the Central Bank Interbank Money Market within their limits
applicable on 17 August 2020 and from Borsa Istanbul’s Repo and Reverse Repo Market and
Committed Transactions Market. Also, in case of liquidity surplus, banks will be able to lend to the
Central Bank at the Central Bank overnight borrowing interest rate without any limit. In addition,
all participants will be able to utilize the overnight repo facility provided through quotation at the
Central Bank overnight lending interest rate against TL denominated lease certificates issued by the
Asset Leasing Company of the Turkish Treasury.
