PRESS RELEASE  
 
TURKISH LIRA DEPOSIT BUYING AUCTIONS PROGRAM FOR AUGUST  
 
In August, CBRT will continue to conduct Turkish Lira deposit buying 
auctions with a standard maturity of 4 weeks that it has initiated in April 2002 
as a supplement to its existing instruments with the aim of enhancing the 
effectiveness of its efforts to sterilize the excess Turkish Lira liquidity in the 
system.  
 
As was the case in July, the CBRT will hold Turkish lira deposit buying 
auctions on Wednesdays and Fridays each week and the maximum amount to be 
auctioned at each auction will be limited to 200 trillion Turkish liras.  
  
 Since it is an official holiday, no auction will be held on August 3 0,2002 
and the maturity of the auction to be held on August 2, 2002  will be September 
2, 2002.
