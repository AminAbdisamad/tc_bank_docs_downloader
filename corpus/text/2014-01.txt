DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Meeting Date: January 21, 2014
Participating Committee Members
Erdem Başçı (Governor), Ahmet Faruk Aysan, Murat Çetinkaya, Turalay Kenç, Necati Şahin,
Abdullah Yavaş, Mehmet Yörükoğlu.

The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term
interest rates constant at the following levels:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 7.75 percent, borrowing rate at
3.5 percent, and the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via
repo transactions at 6.75 percent,
b) One-week repo rate at 4.5 percent,
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing
rate at 0 percent, lending rate at 10.25 percent.
Recent data suggest that final domestic demand and exports continued to grow at a
moderate pace during the fourth quarter. The cautious monetary policy stance, the announced
macroprudential measures, and weak capital flows lead to a gradual slowdown in loan growth.
Accordingly, the decline in the current account deficit excluding gold trade is expected to
continue in 2014.
The Committee monitors the impact of the recent increase in the risk premium on the
inflation outlook and expectations. Inflation is likely to hover above the 5 percent target for some
time due to recent tax adjustments and lagged effects of exchange rate developments. The
Committee stated that the liquidity stance should be tightened to align inflation outlook with the
medium term targets. To this end, interbank money market interest rates will materialize at 9
percent during additional monetary tightening days, instead of 7.75 percent (the marginal
funding rate).
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to
revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five
working days.
