PRESS RELEASE 
ABOUT THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE INTERVENTION 
OF THE CENTRAL BANK 
 
The Central Bank has announced through several pres s releases that under the floating exchange rate 
regime, the level of exchange rate is determined by  supply and demand conditions in the money markets but 
still the volatility in exchange rates is closely m onitored by the Central Bank and that the Central B ank may 
directly intervene in the markets in the event of a n excessive volatility that might occur in both dir ections. In 
this context, the Central Bank directly intervened in the foreign exchange market by buying foreign 
exchange on 9 June 2003 due to the excessive volati lity in the exchange rates. 
In recent days, an excessive volatility is observed  in the foreign exchange market yet again. When 
the appreciation of the US dollar in international markets during the same period is taken into consid eration, 
the volatility in the value of Turkish Lira, partic ularly against the US dollar, has become more appar ent. In 
this framework, the Central Bank directly intervene d in the foreign exchange market today by buying 
foreign currency in order to dampen the excessive v olatility.
