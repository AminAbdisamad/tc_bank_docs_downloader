DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Meeting Date: August 14, 2007
Committee Members
Durmuş Yılmaz (Governor), Erdem Başçı, Burhan Göklemez, M. İbrahim
Turhan, Mehmet Yörükoğlu.

The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) decided to keep short-term
interest rates (policy rates) unchanged as follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 17.50 percent, and lending rate
at 22.50 percent,
b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate applied between 4:00
p.m. – 5:00 p.m. at 13.50 percent, lending rate at 25.50 percent,
c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities
provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 21.50 percent.
Recent developments in economic activity and inflation are in line with the outlook
presented in the July Inflation Report. While private consumption and investment
demand exhibit signs of recovery, external demand moderates. Aggregate demand
conditions continue to support the disinflation process. The Committee notes the
favorable developments in the services inflation since the beginning of 2007.
Notwithstanding the risks related to energy and food prices, inflation continues to
decelerate owing to the lagged effects of strong monetary tightening. The Committee
closely monitors the developments in the international liquidity conditions and the
credit markets, and assesses that these developments have not changed the
inflation outlook at this point.
In this respect the Committee maintains the policy stance outlined in the Inflation
Report, and thus envisions a measured easing starting from the last quarter of 2007.
However, the exact timing and extent of the easing may vary depending on the
incoming information regarding global liquidity conditions, external demand, public
expenditures and other determinants of medium term inflation outlook.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation
outlook will lead the Committee to reconsider its stance.
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight
working days.
