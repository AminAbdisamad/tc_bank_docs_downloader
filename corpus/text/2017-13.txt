Governor Murat Çetinkaya’s Speech on “Macroeconomic
Outlook and Price Stability”
In his speech on “Macroeconomic Outlook and Price Stability” at Denizli Platform of
Industrialists, Merchants and Businessmen, Governor Murat Çetinkaya emphasized
the following points:
• Economic activity displays a moderate recovery while the underlying trend in
the current account balance shows a resumption of the improvement trend.
• Pass-through from recent exchange rate developments may lead to upside
inflationary pressures in the short term; yet, with the support of the tight
monetary stance, inflation is expected to trend downwards by mid-year.
• Monetary tightening to contain the possible deterioration in the pricing
behavior emanating from the recent exchange rate volatility has been largely
effective.
• Heightened global uncertainty necessitates a cautious monetary policy stance.
Accordingly, pricing behavior will be closely monitored and further monetary
tightening will be implemented if necessary.
• The CBRT remains focused on the main goal of price stability. All policy
instruments will be used effectively to attain this objective.
• Additional support from structural policies is also essential for achieving price
stability.
• Encouragement of nonfinancial corporates for prudent borrowing and
effective risk management is a structural dimension which can be further
improved.
