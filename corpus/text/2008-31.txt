The Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) has been implementing an inflation
targeting regime since the beginning of 2006. Central Bank Law, as stipulated in the
Article 42, requires the CBT to be accountable for the non-fulfillment of inflation
targets. Inflation target for end-year 2008 was jointly set with the Government as 4
percent. To facilitate the accountability principle, our policy statement titled
“Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy in 2008” disclosed a quarterly path consistent
with the end-year 2008 targets along with an uncertainty band. In this context, any
breach of upper or lower limits of the band requires the CBT to write an open letter
to the Government, explaining the reasons for the breach and the measures to be
taken to ensure that inflation rate will return to levels within pre-established limits.
Inflation outturn as of September 2008 was 11.13 percent, breaching the upper
limit of the uncertainty band, which was set at 8.3 percent for the end of the third
quarter (Figure 1). Accordingly, this open letter explains the reasons for this breach
and presents the strategy adopted by the CBT to bring inflation back to the medium
term targets.

Reasons For Breaching the Target
Previous open letters dated April and July 2008 had already presented the
reasons why 2008 end-year target would be breached. This section provides a brief
update on inflation developments.
Main factors driving inflation in the third quarter continued to be food and
energy prices. Although food, energy and other commodity prices have started to
ease in September, their past increases have continued to keep annual headline
inflation at relatively high levels. As of third quarter, around 7 percentage points of
the 11.1 percent annual CPI inflation resulted from the direct impact of the rise in
food and energy prices (Figure 2).

Rising energy prices was the main factor impeding the disinflation process in
the third quarter. Despite the sharp downward correction in oil prices, lagged impact
of the past increases continued to put pressure on other energy items such as
electricity, natural gas and coal. As a consequence, the contribution of energy
prices to annual inflation has reached 3.8 percent by the end of the third quarter.
Food inflation showed significant moderation in the third quarter. Favorable
domestic weather conditions and easing commodity prices have helped food
inflation to come down from 14 percent at the end of second quarter to 11.1 percent
in the third quarter. Particularly, unprocessed food inflation, which displayed a
marked correction in the past two quarters, followed a more favorable course than
expected.

During the third quarter, lagged impacts of food and energy prices continued to
drive up services inflation, especially through prices of catering and transport
services. Rents, on the other hand, have been on a steady decline since the second
quarter of 2007 (Figure 3).

Annual rate of increase in CPI excluding food, energy, tobacco and gold (I)
items rose to 7.3 percent from 6.4 of the previous quarter. This can mostly be
attributed to last year’s low base, rather than deterioration in the general price
setting behavior. In fact, seasonally adjusted figures suggest that core inflation has
moderated in the third quarter (Figure 4). Yet, we expect core inflation indicators to
pick up in the last quarter due to recent depreciation in the Turkish lira.

Elevated commodity prices have continued to exert inflationary pressures all
over the world. As depicted in Figure 5, almost all emerging economies under
inflation targeting have faced significant breaches in their inflation targets.

Reaction of Monetary Policy
In order to contain the deterioration in inflation expectations and to prevent the
materialization of the second round effects of supply-side shocks, the Monetary
Policy Committee (MPC) implemented a monetary tightening during May-July
period, increasing the policy rates by a cumulative of 150 basis points. The
tightening in monetary policy, which was implemented jointly with the change in
inflation targets, was effective in controlling expectations. Consequently, inflation
expectations displayed signs of easing in the third quarter (Figure 6). The impact of
the recent exchange rate depreciation on the medium term inflation expectations, on
the other hand, is yet to be seen.

Despite the weakening domestic demand, uncertainties in the global financial
markets have required monetary policy to remain cautious. The MPC has therefore
decided to leave policy rates unchanged in the last three meetings (Table 1). In its
latest statement, the MPC assessed that inflationary impact of the recent exchange
rate movements would be offset by the favorable outlook in food prices and the
sharp decline in oil prices. However, it was also noted that the intensification of the
financial market turmoil required caution in terms of both the monetary policy and
the inflation outlook.

Inflation Outlook
Our forecasts in the July open letter envisaged a gradual recovery in the
domestic economic activity throughout the forecast horizon. However, renewed
tensions in global financial markets imply that the economic activity may continue to
slowdown further. In fact, recent readings on domestic sales, production and
confidence indicators suggest that the weakening in domestic economic activity has
become even more significant since July (Figure 7).1 As the world will feel the
adverse effects of the intensified and prolonged financial market turmoil, both private

Data on consumer credits suggest that financial conditions continue to be
restrictive. Consumer loans in the past year have been growing at a moderate pace
compared to the episodes of vigorous domestic demand (Figure 8). Recently, the
slowdown in consumer loans has become more evident. Increased risk aversion and
the tightening in credit conditions will continue to restrain credit growth in the
forthcoming period.

Longer-term interest rates have also increased significantly in response to
heightened risk premium (Figure 9). Although higher interest rates contain domestic
demand and support disinflation, the impact of rising uncertainties on the overall
pricing behavior should be monitored closely.

The expected weakening in the domestic demand and the recent depreciation
in exchange rates will lead to a higher contribution fromnet exports on aggregate
demand. However, this effect will be partly offset by the slowdown in external
demand due to the economic downturn in our major trading partners.
Overall, we are likely to face a protracted period of weak domestic activity in
the forthcoming period. Hence, our revised forecasts incorporate a larger
contribution from aggregate demand conditions to disinflation, compared to the
previous letter (Figure 10).

High level of uncertainty stemming from recent intensification of global financial
market turmoil has led to an unusually high demand for USD liquidity, leading to
significant depreciation of currencies in emerging markets, including Turkey (Figure
11). The significant slowdown in domestic demand growth should limit the second
round effects of the exchange rate pass-through. Therefore, we expect the passthrough from exchange rates to the domestic inflation to be relatively limited
compared to previous episodes. Still, first round effects of the recent depreciation is
likely to add around 1,2 percentage points to 2008 end-year inflation and a further
1.5 percentage points to 2009 inflation.

Baseline assumptions in the July Inflation Report envisaged a constant path for
oil prices around USD 140 per barrel over the forecast horizon. However, oil prices
displayed a sharp fall in the meantime, suggesting a downward revision in our
assumptions. Taking the average future prices in the first three weeks of October as
a benchmark, we have revised our baseline scenario for oil prices down to USD 80
per barrel. On the other hand, domestic prices of other energy items such as
electricity and natural gas have increased at a faster pace than we expected, partly
limiting the favorable impact of the fall in oil prices. Overall, the developments in
energy prices has led to a downward revision in our end-2008 inflation forecast by
0.5 percentage points, and in our end-2009 forecast by 1.1 percentage points.2
Food prices also followed a more favorable course than implied by our
baseline scenario in the July Inflation Report. Taking into account better than
expected realizations in unprocessed food prices and easing agricultural commodity
2

Research conducted by our staff suggests that a 10 percent fall in oil prices leads to a reduction in annual
inflation by around 0.4-0.5 percentage points in two years’ time. October Inflation Report provides more details
on this finding.

prices, we have lowered the assumptions for food inflation from 14 percent to 11
percent for the year 2008, and from 9 percent to 7.5 percent for the year 2009.
These changes have led to a downward revision of about 0.8 points for 2008 and
0.4 percentage points for 2009. Moreover, we have revised our assumptions for
2010 food inflation down from 7 percent to 6 percent.
Services inflation turned out to be higher than expected in the third quarter,
owing to the impact of the accumulated supply shocks on catering and transport
services. This development has led to an upward revision of our end-2008 forecast
by 0.6 percentage points. We expect services inflation to decelerate significantly in
2009 with the expected moderation in aggregate demand.
Accordingly, we have revised up our end-2008 inflation forecast to 11,1
percent. Our medium term forecasts suggest that, with 70 percent probability,
inflation will be between 6.1 and 9.1 percent (mid-point 7,6) at the end of 2009, and
between 4.3 percent and 7.9 per cent (mid-point 6.1) at the end of 2010. We
forecast inflation to come down to 5.4 percent by the end of the third quarter of 2011
(Figure 12).

* The shaded region indicates the 70 percent confidence interval for the forecast.

To sum up, there has been no major revision in our medium term inflation
forecasts, as the impact of the favorable food and energy prices and the weakening
demand on inflation will be largely offset by the pass-through from recent exchange
rate depreciation.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information regarding the
inflation outlook may lead to a change in our policy stance. Given the exceptionally

9

Central Bank of Turkey

high level of uncertainties in global financial markets, monetary policy needs to
remain flexible.

Risks
Recent problems in global credit markets have led to a loss of confidence in
the global financial system. These developments have adversely affected the global
liquidity flows and triggered an extraordinary demand for liquidity, especially in USD.
Acting promptly and in a coordinated manner, central banks are taking decisions in
an effort to overcome the liquidity squeeze in money markets. In line with these
efforts, we have taken several measures to maintain the smooth functioning of
domestic foreign exchange markets. First, the Central Bank of Turkey resumed its
intermediary role in the Foreign Exchange Deposit Market. Second, we have
suspended foreign exchange purchase auctions in order to further enhance the
liquidity conditions of Turkish banks. Third, we have started to inject foreign
exchange liquidity into the market through foreign exchange selling auctions to avoid
undesired volatility in foreign exchange markets. We will continue to implement
necessary measures to ensure the well functioning of financial markets in Turkey.
Looking ahead, credit conditions are expected to continue to tighten in the
forthcoming period. Regarding the inflation outlook, these developments create
upside risks through potential portfolio movements in the short term, but downside
risks through weaker aggregate demand in the medium term. Given the uncertainty
surrounding the global economic outlook, monetary policy needs to be flexible on
either side. Therefore, future monetary policy decisions will depend on the impact of
the ongoing financial turmoil on the domestic economy.
Commodity prices continue to be volatile, creating risks to the inflation outlook.
Despite the downward revision in projections for food and energy prices, our main
scenario is still based on quite conservative assumptions, implying that the risks are
on both sides.3 Should the upside risks materialize, monetary policy will be
conducted so as to minimize deviations from the targets. Downward surprises in
food and energy prices, on the other hand, will be perceived as an opportunity to
bring inflation down at a faster pace than implied by our medium term targets.
Finally, a critical underlying assumption for the inflation and monetary policy
outlook outlined above is that government expenditures and incomes policy will
evolve in line with the official projections, and that there will be no further increases
in indirect taxes or administered price adjustments, except those required by the
automatic pricing mechanisms in place. In particular, this means any needed
tightening in the fiscal balance would occur largely through expenditure cuts rather
than higher excise taxes. Any deviation from this framework may lead to a revision
of the outlook for inflation and monetary policy.

scenarios for food and energy prices.

Conclusion
International markets have witnessed extraordinarily high level of volatility
since the publication of the July open letter. This process has led to several
significant changes in factors affecting inflation: First, recent depreciation in the
Turkish Lira will create upward pressure on inflation, especially in the short term.
Second, domestic demand conditions have been weaker than expected, implying
larger contribution from aggregate demand conditions to disinflation compared to the
previous letter. Third, with the sharp decline in commodity prices, we have revised
down our assumptions for food and oil prices. We expect that the pass-through from
recent exchange rate depreciation will be largely offset by the disinflationary impact
of the favorable food and energy prices and the weakening aggregate demand.
Accordingly, our inflation forecasts suggest that inflation targets at 7.5 percent,
6.5 percent, and 5,5 percent set for the next three years in the Medium Term
Program are attainable, even under quite conservative assumptions for food and
energy prices. However, it should be noted that the intensification of the financial
market turmoil requires caution with regard to both the monetary policy and the
inflation outlook.
The Central Bank of Turkey has been closely monitoring the liquidity conditions
in the domestic markets. We have taken several measures in order to facilitate the
smooth functioning of our financial markets. We will continue to take the necessary
measures to contain the adverse effects of the global financial turmoil on the
domestic economy. Future policy decisions will largely depend on the developments
in global markets and their reflections on the local financial markets.
Prudent monetary policy is necessary but not sufficient to maintain the
resilience of the economy against the global financial turmoil. Preserving the fiscal
discipline and strengthening the structural reform agenda would also help to mitigate
the adverse effects of the ongoing shocks on the domestic economy. In this respect,
the European Union accession process and the implementation of structural reforms
envisaged in the economic program remain to be of utmost importance. In particular,
advances in structural reforms, which would improve the quality of fiscal discipline
and enhance productivity gains, are monitored closely by the CBT with regard to
their implications on macroeconomic and price stability.
