The Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) has been implementing  an inflation 
targeting regime since the beginning of 2006. Central  Bank Law, as stipulated in the 
Article 42, requires the CBT to be accountable for the non-fulfillment of inflation 
targets. Inflation target for end-year 2008 was joint ly set with the Government as 4 
percent. To facilitate the accountability principle, our  policy statement titled 
“Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy in 2008” disclosed a q uarterly path consistent 
with the end-year 2008 targets along with an uncertai nty band. In this context, any 
breach of upper or lower limits of the band requires t he CBT to write an open letter 
to the Government, explaining the reasons for the breach  and the measures to be 
taken to ensure that inflation rate will return to le vels within pre-established limits. 
Inflation outturn as of September 2008 was 11.13 perce nt, breaching the upper 
limit of the uncertainty band, which was set at 8.3 per cent for the end of the third 
quarter (Figure 1). Accordingly, this open letter expla ins the reasons for this breach 
and presents the strategy adopted by the CBT to bring inflation back to the medium 
term targets.

Reasons For Breaching the Target 
Previous open letters dated April and July 2008 had alr eady presented the 
reasons why 2008 end-year target would be breached. Th is section provides a brief 
update on inflation developments.  
Main factors driving inflation in the third quarter con tinued to be food and 
energy prices. Although food, energy and other commodi ty prices have started to 
ease in September, their past increases have continued to keep annual headline 
inflation at relatively high levels. As of third quarte r, around 7 percentage points of 
the 11.1 percent annual CPI inflation resulted from t he direct impact of the rise in 
food and energy prices (Figure 2).

Rising energy prices was the main factor impeding the di sinflation process in 
the third quarter. Despite the sharp downward correctio n in oil prices, lagged impact 
of the past increases continued to put pressure on other e nergy items such as 
electricity, natural gas and coal.  As a consequence, the co ntribution of energy 
prices to annual inflation has reached 3.8 percent by th e end of the third quarter.  
Food inflation showed significant moderation in the th ird quarter. Favorable 
domestic weather conditions and easing commodity prices have  helped food 
inflation to come down from 14 percent at the end of second quarter to 11.1 percent 
in the third quarter. Particularly, unprocessed food in flation, which displayed a 
marked correction in the past two quarters, followed a m ore favorable course than 
expected.                                                                                       Central Bank of Turkey  
 3During the third quarter, lagged impacts of food and energy prices continued to 
drive up services inflation, especially through prices of cat ering and transport 
services. Rents, on the other hand, have been on a steady decline since the second 
quarter of 2007 (Figure 3).

Annual rate of increase in CPI excluding food, energy, tobacco and gold (I) 
items rose to 7.3 percent from 6.4 of the previous quart er. This can mostly be 
attributed to last year’s low base, rather than deteri oration in the general price 
setting behavior. In fact, seasonally adjusted figures sugg est that core inflation has 
moderated in the third quarter (Figure 4). Yet, we expect core inflation indicators to 
pick up in the last quarter due to recent depreciation i n the Turkish lira.

Reaction of Monetary Policy 
In order to contain the deterioration in inflation e xpectations and to prevent the 
materialization of the second round effects of supply-side  shocks, the Monetary 
Policy Committee (MPC) implemented a monetary tighte ning during May-July 
period, increasing the policy rates by a cumulative of 15 0 basis points. The 
tightening in monetary policy, which was implemented j ointly with the change in 
inflation targets, was effective in controlling expectatio ns. Consequently, inflation 
expectations displayed signs of easing in the third quarte r (Figure 6). The impact of 
the recent exchange rate depreciation on the medium ter m inflation expectations, on 
the other hand, is yet to be seen.

Despite the weakening domestic demand, uncertainties in t he global financial 
markets have required monetary policy to remain cautious.  The MPC has therefore 
decided to leave policy rates unchanged in the last three  meetings (Table 1). In its 
latest statement, the MPC assessed that inflationary impa ct of the recent exchange 
rate movements would be offset by the favorable outlook in food prices and the 
sharp decline in oil prices. However, it was also noted th at the intensification of the 
financial market turmoil required caution in terms of b oth the monetary policy and 
the inflation outlook.

Inflation Outlook 
Our forecasts in the July open letter envisaged a gradual  recovery in the 
domestic economic activity throughout the forecast horizon.  However, renewed 
tensions in global financial markets imply that the econo mic activity may continue to 
slowdown further. In fact, recent readings on domestic sal es, production and 
confidence indicators suggest that the weakening in domesti c economic activity has 
become even more significant since July (Figure 7). 1 As the world will feel the 
adverse effects of the intensified and prolonged financia l market turmoil, both private

period. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Data on consumer credits suggest that financial conditions co ntinue to be 
restrictive. Consumer loans in the past year have been gro wing at a moderate pace 
compared to the episodes of vigorous domestic demand (Figu re 8). Recently, the 
slowdown in consumer loans has become more evident. Increase d risk aversion and 
the tightening in credit conditions will continue to re strain credit growth in the 
forthcoming period. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Longer-term interest rates have also increased significantl y in response to 
heightened risk premium (Figure 9). Although higher i nterest rates contain domestic 
demand and support disinflation, the impact of rising u ncertainties on the overall 
pricing behavior should be monitored closely. Figure 7: Final Domestic Demand

The expected weakening in the domestic demand and the re cent depreciation 
in exchange rates will lead to a higher contribution fr omnet exports on aggregate 
demand. However, this effect will be partly offset by t he slowdown in external 
demand due to the economic downturn in our major trad ing partners.  
Overall, we are likely to face a protracted period of w eak domestic activity in 
the forthcoming period. Hence, our revised forecasts incorp orate a larger 
contribution from aggregate demand conditions to disinf lation, compared to the 
previous letter (Figure 10).

 8High level of uncertainty stemming from recent intensifi cation of global financial 
market turmoil has led to an unusually high demand for  USD liquidity, leading to 
significant depreciation of currencies in emerging markets , including Turkey (Figure 
11). The significant slowdown in domestic demand growth should limit the second 
round effects of the exchange rate pass-through. Therefor e, we expect the pass-
through from exchange rates to the domestic inflation to  be relatively limited 
compared to previous episodes. Still, first round effects o f the recent depreciation is 
likely to add around 1,2 percentage points to 2008 end -year inflation and a further 
1.5 percentage points to 2009 inflation. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Baseline assumptions in the July Inflation Report envisage d a constant path for 
oil prices around USD 140 per barrel over the forecast h orizon. However, oil prices 
displayed a sharp fall in the meantime, suggesting a do wnward revision in our 
assumptions. Taking the average future prices in the first three weeks of October as 
a benchmark, we have revised our baseline scenario for oil prices down to USD 80 
per barrel. On the other hand, domestic prices of other  energy items such as 
electricity and natural gas have increased at a faster pace  than we expected, partly 
limiting the favorable impact of the fall in oil price s. Overall, the developments in 
energy prices has led to a downward revision in our end- 2008 inflation forecast by 
0.5 percentage points, and in our end-2009 forecast by 1.1 percentage points. 2 
Food prices also followed a more favorable course than im plied by our 
baseline scenario in the July Inflation Report. Taking i nto account better than 
expected realizations in unprocessed food prices and easing agricultural commodity 
                                                
2 Research conducted by our staff suggests that a 10  percent fall in oil prices leads to a reduction in  annual 
inflation by around 0.4-0.5 percentage points in tw o years’ time. October Inflation Report provides mo re details 
on this finding. Figure 11: Risk Premium and Nominal Exchange Rates

 9prices, we have lowered the assumptions for food inflatio n from 14 percent to 11 
percent for the year 2008, and from 9 percent to 7.5 percent for the year 2009. 
These changes have led to a downward revision of about 0. 8 points for 2008 and 
0.4 percentage points for 2009. Moreover, we have revised  our assumptions for 
2010 food inflation down from 7 percent to 6 percent.  
Services inflation turned out to be higher than expected  in the third quarter, 
owing to the impact of the accumulated supply shocks on cate ring and transport 
services. This development has led to an upward revision of our end-2008 forecast 
by 0.6 percentage points. We expect services inflation to d ecelerate significantly in 
2009 with the expected moderation in aggregate demand . 
Accordingly, we have revised up our end-2008 inflation f orecast to 11,1 
percent. Our medium term forecasts suggest that, with 70 percent probability, 
inflation will be between 6.1 and 9.1 percent (mid-p oint 7,6) at the end of 2009, and 
between 4.3 percent and 7.9 per cent (mid-point 6.1) at the end of 2010. We 
forecast inflation to come down to 5.4 percent by the e nd of the third quarter of 2011 
(Figure 12).

* The shaded region indicates the 70 percent confiden ce interval for the forecast.  
To sum up, there has been no major revision in our medi um term inflation 
forecasts, as the impact of the favorable food and energy  prices and the weakening 
demand on inflation will be largely offset by the pa ss-through from recent exchange 
rate depreciation. 
It should be emphasized that any new data or informat ion regarding the 
inflation outlook may lead to a change in our policy st ance. Given the exceptionally -6 -4 -2 0246810 12

Risks 
Recent problems in global credit markets have led to a lo ss of confidence in 
the global financial system. These developments have adverse ly affected the global 
liquidity flows and triggered an extraordinary demand  for liquidity, especially in USD. 
Acting promptly and in a coordinated manner, central b anks are taking decisions in 
an effort to overcome the liquidity squeeze in money m arkets. In line with these 
efforts, we have taken several measures to maintain the smo oth functioning of 
domestic foreign exchange markets. First, the Central Bank of Turkey resumed its 
intermediary role in the Foreign Exchange Deposit Marke t. Second, we have 
suspended foreign exchange purchase auctions in order to fu rther enhance the 
liquidity conditions of Turkish banks. Third, we have start ed to inject foreign 
exchange liquidity into the market through foreign excha nge selling auctions to avoid 
undesired volatility in foreign exchange markets. We will  continue to implement 
necessary measures to ensure the well functioning of finan cial markets in Turkey.  
Looking ahead, credit conditions are expected to continue to tighten in the 
forthcoming period. Regarding the inflation outlook, these developments create 
upside risks through potential portfolio movements in the  short term, but downside 
risks through weaker aggregate demand in the medium ter m. Given the uncertainty 
surrounding the global economic outlook, monetary policy  needs to be flexible on 
either side. Therefore, future monetary policy decision s will depend on the impact of 
the ongoing financial turmoil on the domestic economy. 
Commodity prices continue to be volatile, creating risks to  the inflation outlook. 
Despite the downward revision in projections for food an d energy prices, our main 
scenario is still based on quite conservative assumptions, impl ying that the risks are 
on both sides. 3 Should the upside risks materialize, monetary policy wi ll be 
conducted so as to minimize deviations from the targets. D ownward surprises in 
food and energy prices, on the other hand, will be pe rceived as an opportunity to 
bring inflation down at a faster pace than implied by  our medium term targets. 
Finally, a critical underlying assumption for the infla tion and monetary policy 
outlook outlined above is that government expenditures an d incomes policy will 
evolve in line with the official projections, and that t here will be no further increases 
in indirect taxes or administered price adjustments, except those required by the 
automatic pricing mechanisms in place. In particular, this means any needed 
tightening in the fiscal balance would occur largely thr ough expenditure cuts rather 
than higher excise taxes. Any deviation from this framewor k may lead to a revision 
of the outlook for inflation and monetary policy.

Conclusion 
International markets have witnessed extraordinarily high  level of volatility 
since the publication of the July open letter. This proce ss has led to several 
significant changes in factors affecting inflation: First, recent depreciation in the 
Turkish Lira will create upward pressure on inflation, e specially in the short term. 
Second, domestic demand conditions have been weaker than e xpected, implying 
larger contribution from aggregate demand conditions t o disinflation compared to the 
previous letter. Third, with the sharp decline in commod ity prices, we have revised 
down our assumptions for food and oil prices. We expect th at the pass-through from 
recent exchange rate depreciation will be largely offset  by the disinflationary impact 
of the favorable food and energy prices and the weakeni ng aggregate demand.  
Accordingly, our inflation forecasts suggest that inflatio n targets at 7.5 percent, 
6.5 percent, and 5,5 percent set for the next three yea rs in the Medium Term 
Program are attainable, even under quite conservative assu mptions for food and 
energy prices. However, it should be noted that the int ensification of the financial 
market turmoil requires caution with regard to both th e monetary policy and the 
inflation outlook. 
The Central Bank of Turkey has been closely monitoring t he liquidity conditions 
in the domestic markets. We have taken several measures in or der to facilitate the 
smooth functioning of our financial markets. We will cont inue to take the necessary 
measures to contain the adverse effects of the global fina ncial turmoil on the 
domestic economy. Future policy decisions will largely dep end on the developments 
in global markets and their reflections on the local fin ancial markets. 
Prudent monetary policy is necessary but not sufficient to  maintain the 
resilience of the economy against the global financial t urmoil. Preserving the fiscal 
discipline and strengthening the structural reform agend a would also help to mitigate 
the adverse effects of the ongoing shocks on the domestic econ omy. In this respect, 
the European Union accession process and the implementatio n of structural reforms 
envisaged in the economic program remain to be of utmost  importance. In particular, 
advances in structural reforms, which would improve the qua lity of fiscal discipline 
and enhance productivity gains, are monitored closely by the CBT with regard to 
their implications on macroeconomic and price stability.
