PRESS RELEASE ON THE PRACTICES RELATED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE
MARKETS AND OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS

1. As is known, with the aim of avoiding negative impacts of developments in the
global economy on the financial stability of our country, the Central Bank of the
Republic of Turkey (CBRT) has taken several measures related to foreign
exchange and Turkish Lira liquidity since October 2008. The said measures
have provided significant support to restoring financial stability.

2. With the beginning of the normalization process in international markets, the
exit strategy, which includes withdrawing measures taken during the crisis,
was announced to the public in the press release of 14 April 2010 on the
“Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey Monetary Policy Exit Strategy”. In the
said press release, the CBRT declared that it plans to take measures related
to foreign exchange liquidity to pre-crisis levels as normalization in global
markets becomes significant. In this framework, considering the improvement
in international liquidity conditions and the increase in foreign exchange
liquidity of the banking system in the recent period, the intermediary
functioning of the CBRT in the Foreign Exchange and Banknotes Markets
Foreign Exchange Deposit Market is suspended. Even though the
intermediary functioning of the CBRT in the foreign exchange deposit market
is over, the banks will still be able to borrow foreign exchange deposits from
the CBRT within their limits. However, the maturity of the said transactions will
be one week, as was the case before October 2008.

3. On the other hand, during the global crisis weakening of capital flows all
around the world slowed down capital inflows to our country, thus causing an
increase in liquidity shortage and as the liquidity shortage became permanent,
starting from 19 June 2009 in addition to the 1-week repo auctions, the basic

funding instrument of the CBRT, 3-month repo auctions were introduced. As
stated in the 17th paragraph of the exit strategy announcement published on
14 April 2010, “As long as the liquidity shortage continues at high levels,
although the amount may change depending on liquidity level, three-month
repo auctions will continue to be a regular funding instrument”. In order to
implement the existing liquidity management framework effectively, the
liquidity shortage funded by 1-week repo auctions should not be below 4-5
billion Turkish Liras (TL). As of 14 October 2010, the outstanding amount
funded by repo auctions was 13 billion TL, of which 9 billion TL belongs to 1week repo auctions. In the upcoming period, due to ongoing FX purchases of
the CBRT and the Treasury’s reduction of its cash account balance within the
CBRT, the liquidity shortage is expected to decline from time to time. Thus,
considering that 3-month repo funding is no longer needed, those auctions
have been terminated.

4. To support the primary dealership system, the CBRT has provided overnight
or weekly repo facilities since 3 September 2002 at preannounced interest
rates to primary dealers. Given the exit strategy framework, as the gradual
technical interest rate adjustment process has been achieved, the main
funding instrument of the CBRT will be the 1-week repo auctions. On the other
hand, since other short-term lending and borrowing options are implemented
at overnight maturity, in order to harmonize maturities of similar liquidity
management tools, the repo facility, which is extended to primary dealers
within the open market operations framework, will only be available at
overnight maturity starting from 15 October 2010.
