The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the policy rate (one -week repo 
auction rate) constant at 24 percent.  
Recently released data show that rebalancing trend in the econom y has become more noticeable . 
External demand maintains its relative strength while economic activity  displays a slow pace , partly due 
to tight financial conditions . Current account balance is expected to maintain its improving trend .  
Developments in import prices and domestic demand conditions  have led to some  improvement in 
inflation indicators . Yet, risks on price stability  continue to prevail . Accordingly, the Committee has 
decided to maintain the tight  monetary policy stance  until inflation outlook displays a significant 
improvement . 
The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. 
Inflation expectations, pricing behavior , lagged impact of recent monetary policy decisions, contribution 
of fiscal policy to rebalanc ing process, and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, 
if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.  
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.  
The summary of  the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days.
