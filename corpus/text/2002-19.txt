I- DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MONETARY PROGRAM DURING 
THE JANUARY -FEBRUARY 2002 PERIOD  
 
The targets specified in the Letter of Intent (LOI) dated 18 January 
2002 as the performance and indicative criteria among the main monetary 
aggregates on the Central Bank balance sheet have been achieved. The 
details of the said targets and actual figures realised are given below:  
 
1. As is known, in the 2002 Monetary Prog ram, the monetary base 
was taken as the nominal anchor and the ceilings were set for it as the 
performance criteria during the first half of the year and as the indicative 
targets for the rest of the year. The ceiling set for the end -February 2002 
was 8.25 0 trillion Turkish Lira. However, in order to eliminate the 
distortional impact of the Kurban Bayramı (religious Feast), which would 
cause the money demand to increase temporarily, the realization of the 
target figure is measured by taking the average figu res on 11 and 12 of 
February and March 2002. The average monetary base figure for the said 
period has been realized as 7.823 trillion Turkish Lira, well below the target 
ceiling of 8.250 trillion Turkish Lira.  
 
2. In the LOI, a floor was set for the Net I nternational Reserves 
(NIR) as the performance criteria, which is calculated by subtracting the 
IMF credit tranche received by the Treasury and the short -term foreign 
exchange debt of the Treasury with maturity less than 1 year from the 
CBRT Net Internatio nal Reserves. As of 28 February 2002, the CBRT NIR, 
the Treasury’s debt to the IMF, and the Treasury’s short -term foreign 
exchange debts were realized as 5.580 million USD, 9.194 million USD, and 
1.293 million USD respectively. Taking these figures into co nsideration, the 
CBRT NIR materialized as (minus) –4.907 million USD, again well above the 
performance target floor of (minus) –6.500 million USD.  
 
3. Similarly, in the LOI, a floor was set for CBRT Net Domestic 
Assets (NDA) as an indicative target, which is calculated by adding the 
Turkish Lira equivalents of the IMF credits received by the Treasury and the short -term foreign exchange debt of the Treasury with maturity less 
than 1 year to the CBRT NDA. The said target for the end -February 2002 
was 26.100 t rillion Turkish Lira. Due to the temporary impact of the Kurban 
Bayramı, the same method of computation, which was employed in the case 
of the monetary base, was used. During the four days period, the average 
CBRT NDA, the Treasury’s debt to the IMF and th e Treasury’s foreign 
exchange debts with maturity less than 1 year were realized as 9.242 trillion 
Turkish Lira, 13.236 trillion Turkish Lira and 1.840 trillion Turkish Lira 
respectively. Thus, the average NDA realized is 24.318 trillion Turkish Lira, 
which is below the indicative target -ceiling figure of 26.100 trillion Turkish 
Lira. 
 
II-  TARGETS OF MONETARY PROGRAM FOR THE MARCH -APRIL 
2002 PERIOD.  
 
1. The target for monetary base, which is a performance criterion 
for the end -April, is 8.900 trillion Turk ish Lira. Calculation will be based on 
the averaging of the figures realized in the last five business days of April.  
 
2. The floor set as a performance criterion for NIR is (minus) –
7.200 million USD for the end -April.  
 
3. The ceiling set for NDA for the end-April, which is an indicative 
target, is 27.700 trillion Turkish Lira. Calculation will be based on the 
averaging of the figures realized in the last five business days of April.
