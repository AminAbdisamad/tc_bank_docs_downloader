The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo
auction rate) constant at 8.25 percent.
As developments regarding the spread of the coronavirus substantially weakened global growth in the
second quarter, normalization steps taken by several countries have contributed to a partial recovery.
While uncertainties on global economic recovery remain high, central banks in advanced and emerging
economies continue to take expansionary measures. The pandemic disease is closely monitored for its
evolving global impact on capital flows, financial conditions, international trade and commodity prices.
While the weakening in economic activity became more pronounced in April, economic recovery has
started as of May following gradual steps towards normalization. In order to contain negative effects of
the pandemic on the Turkish economy, it is of crucial importance to ensure the healthy functioning of
financial markets, the credit channel and firms’ cash flows. In this respect, recent monetary and fiscal
measures contribute to financial stability and economic recovery by supporting the potential output of
the economy. Recently, exports and tourism revenues declined due to the pandemic. However, the
recovery in exports of goods with the ongoing normalization and low levels of commodity prices will
support the current account balance in the upcoming periods.
Despite the restraining effects of aggregate demand conditions, pandemic-related rise in unit costs have
led to some increase in the trends of core inflation indicators. International commodity prices have
continued to restrain consumer inflation, while food inflation has risen due to seasonal and pandemicrelated effects. As the normalization process continues, supply-side factors, which have prevailed
recently due to pandemic-related restrictions, will phase out and demand-driven disinflationary effects
will become more prevalent in the second half of the year. Accordingly, considering all factors affecting
the inflation outlook, the Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged.
The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is a key factor for achieving
lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the
disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary
stance. In this respect, monetary stance will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying
inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to
use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days.
