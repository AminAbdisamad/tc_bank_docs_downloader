The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo
auction rate) from 13 percent to 12 percent.
The weakening effects of geopolitical risks on global economic activity continue to increase.
Global growth forecasts for the upcoming period are being revised downwards and recession is
increasingly assessed as an inevitable risk factor. While the negative consequences of supply
constraints in some sectors, particularly basic food, have been alleviated by the strategic
solutions facilitated by Türkiye, the upward trend in producer and consumer prices continues on
an international scale. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and
international financial markets are closely monitored. Moreover, central banks in advanced
economies emphasize that the rise in inflation may last longer than previously anticipated due to
rising energy prices, imbalances between supply and demand, and rigidities in labor markets.
The divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced
economies continue due to their diverse economic outlook. It is observed that central banks
continue their efforts to develop new supportive measures and tools to cope with the increasing
uncertainties in financial markets.
A strong growth was observed in the first half of 2022. Since the beginning of July, leading
indicators have been pointing to a slowdown in growth due to the weakening foreign demand.
Compared to peer economies, job creation has been stronger. Considering the sectors that
contribute to the employment increase, it is observed that the growth dynamics are supported
by structural gains. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, the
stronger than expected contribution of tourism revenues to the current account balance
continues. On the other hand, high course of energy prices and the likelihood of a recession in
main trade partners keep the risks on current account balance alive. Sustainable current account
balance is important for price stability. The rate of credit growth and allocation of funds for real
economic activity purposes are closely monitored. In addition, the spread between policy rate
and the loan interest rates driven by the announced macroprudential measures is closely
monitored. The Committee will continue to further strengthen the tools supporting the
effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism.
Increase in inflation is driven by the lagged and indirect effects of rising energy costs resulting
from geopolitical developments, effects of pricing formations that are not supported by
economic fundamentals, strong negative supply shocks caused by the rise in global energy, food
and agricultural commodity prices. The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the
back of measures taken and decisively implemented for strengthening sustainable price and
financial stability along with the resolution of the ongoing regional conflict. Additionally, leading
indicators for the third quarter continue pointing to loss of momentum in economic activity due
to the decreasing foreign demand. It is important that financial conditions remain supportive to
1

preserve the growth momentum in industrial production and the positive trend in employment
in a period of increasing uncertainties regarding global growth as well as escalating geopolitical
risk. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to reduce the policy rate by 100 basis points, and
has assessed that the updated level of policy rate is adequate under the current outlook. To
create an institutional basis for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy
framework continues with the aim of encouraging permanent and strengthened liraization in all
policy tools of the CBRT. The credit, collateral and liquidity policy actions, of which the review
process is finalized, will continue to be implemented to strengthen the effectiveness of the
monetary policy transmission mechanism.
The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively within the framework of
liraization strategy until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the mediumterm 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. Stability in
the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall
in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward
trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a
viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy
and sustainable way.
The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven
framework.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working
days.
