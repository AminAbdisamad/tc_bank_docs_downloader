DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Meeting Date: March 23, 2011
Participating Committee Members
Durmuş Yılmaz (Governor), Erdem Başçı, Burhan Göklemez, Turalay Kenç,
M. Đbrahim Turhan, Abdullah Yavaş, Mehmet Yörükoğlu.
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the policy
rates constant at the following levels:
a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) at 6.25 percent,
b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 1.50 percent, lending rate at 9
percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via
repo transactions at 8 percent,
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.):
Borrowing rate at 0 percent, lending rate at 12 percent.
Recent releases on economic activity have been consistent with the outlook
presented in the January Inflation Report. Economic activity continues to strengthen
amid increasing domestic demand, while external demand remains relatively weak
despite the recent pick up. Employment conditions continue to improve, though,
unemployment rates remain at high levels. However, oil and other commodity prices
hover above the Inflation Report assumptions. Accordingly, core goods inflation would
continue to increase for sometime, while services inflation is expected to display a more
benign path.
Although the measures taken by the Central Bank since November are expected
to have an impact on credit volume and domestic demand starting with the second
quarter, some additional increase in reserve requirement is deemed necessary for
macroprudential purposes. In this respect, the Committee believes that today’s decision
on reserve requirements also provides the monetary tightening required for containing
the potential second round effects of the recent increases in oil and other commodity
prices.
In light of these assessments, in order to contain the risks towards price stability
and financial stability, the Committee has decided to monitor the tightening impact of the
implemented policy mix—a low policy rate, a wide interest corridor and high reserve
requirement ratios—and take additional measures along the same lines, if needed.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the
Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within
five working days.
