THE CBRT PRESS RELEASE ON LIMITS FOR THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE
AND BANKNOTES MARKET TRANSACTIONS

The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey has been taking various measures
in order to prevent the recent problems in the international credit markets from
affecting the orderly flow of liquidity in our local financial markets.
Within this framework, the Central Bank resumed its intermediary role in the
Foreign Exchange Deposit Market within the Central Bank on 9 October 2008.
Furthermore, considering the level of the banks’ balance sheet aggregates,
transaction limits in the Foreign Exchange and Banknotes Markets were revised as of
14 October 2008 and set at USD 5.4 billion in total.
As it is the market of the last resort, the commission rates in the Foreign
Exchange Deposit Market have been set at exclusively high levels with a view to
encourage direct transactions among banks. Transaction volumes are relatively low
and market interest rates are set in accordance with demand and supply conditions in
this market, which operates as planned. Interest rates for the transactions among
banks have been declining in both USD and Euro transactions since 9 October 2008,
when the intermediary activities in Foreign Exchange Deposit Market were resumed.
As a result of the transactions conducted in the afore-mentioned market, the
total debt balance became USD 193 million on 22 October 2008. This figure amounts
to only 4 percent of the total limits.
In the meantime, as announced to the public with the press release on
‘Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2008’ dated 18 December 2007, banks are
able to borrow foreign exchange in terms of USD and Euro from the Central Bank
through the Foreign Exchange Deposit Market, within the predetermined limits with
one-week maturity. No bank has yet needed to borrow through this facility from the
Central Bank at the interest rates that had to be set high within the scope of the
Central Bank’s function as the lender of the last resort.

Meanwhile, although there is no foreign exchange liquidity problem in the
Turkish banking system, transaction limits of the Foreign Exchange and Banknotes
Markets will be doubled starting from 24 October 2008 for each institution and will
reach USD 10.8 billion in total, in order to ensure that the system meets its possible
foreign exchange liquidity needs smoothly in the upcoming months.
