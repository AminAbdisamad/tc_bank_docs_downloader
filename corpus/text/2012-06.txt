PRESS RELEASE ON  
FOREIGN EXCHANGE SELLING AUCTIONS  
 
As is known, from 5 August 2011 the Central Bank began to supply foreign 
exchange liquidity to the market via foreign exchange selling auctions, when deemed 
necessary. In its press release No: 2011- 86 of 26 December 2011, the Central Bank 
announced that from 27 December 2011 the maximum selling amount permitted in daily selling auctions would be USD 1,350 million and the total maximum selling 
amount permitted for the following two working days would be USD 1,700 million for 
the term until the next Monetary Policy Committee Meeting; and that except in extraordinary circumstances, only up to USD 50 million of offers received would be 
met. 
Furthermore, starting from 6 January 2012, the Central Bank started to hold 
intraday foreign exchange selling auctions on days deemed necessary. At each intraday auction, USD 50 million was sold and the full amount of offers received was 
met up to the auction amount.  
 Taking into consideration the ongoing improvement in current account 
dynamics and the sudden swings in global conditions , at its meeting on 24 January 
2012, the Monetary Policy Committee stated that intraday f oreign exchange selling 
auctions would be more effective and more consistent with monetary policy 
objectives, compared to the regular foreign exchange selling auctions.  
Therefore, the Committee decided to suspend the regular foreign exchange 
selling auctio ns as of 25 January 2012. However, when deemed necessary , the 
Central Bank will continue to hold intraday foreign exchange selling auctions  within 
the framework stipulated in the “Press Release on Intraday Foreign Exchange Selling 
Auctions” dated 6 January  2012 and the maximum daily amount to be sold via 
intraday auctions was set as USD 500 million until the next Monetary Policy 
Committee Meeting.
