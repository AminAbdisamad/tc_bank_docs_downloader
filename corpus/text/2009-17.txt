The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to lower the policy
rates as follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate is decreased from 9.75 percent to
9.25 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 12.25 percent to 11.75
percent,
b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate between 4:00 p.m. –
5:00 p.m. is decreased from 5.75 percent to 5.25 percent, while lending rate is
decreased from 15.25 percent to 14.75 percent,
c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities
provided for primary dealers via repo transactions is decreased from 11.25
percent to 10.75 percent.
Recent data releases point to a partial recovery in private consumption demand.
However, problems in international credit markets persist and there are no significant
signs of improvement in the outlook for global economy. External demand remains
weak while domestic investment demand continues to contract. These developments
suggest that the economic activity and employment are not likely to recover anytime
soon. Therefore, downward pressures on inflation are expected to prevail for some time.
Moreover, past declines in oil and other commodity prices inflation are likely to further
contribute to disinflation in the near term. In light of these assessments, the Committee
believes that recent developments are consistent with the outlook presented in the April
Inflation Report and has decided to cut policy rates by 50 basis points.
The Committee has indicated that the rate cuts have lowered the probability of
significantly undershooting the medium term inflation targets. However, the tightness in
financial conditions still persists to some extent, and uncertainties regarding the impact
of the problems in financial markets on the real economy persist, suggesting that
downside risks still remain. Looking forward, the Committee envisages that the next rate
cut may be measured, and that it seems necessary for the monetary policy to maintain
an easing bias for a considerable period.
The Central Bank will continue to take the necessary measures to contain the
adverse effects of the global financial turmoil on the domestic economy, provided that
they do not conflict with the price stability objective.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation
outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within
eight working days.
