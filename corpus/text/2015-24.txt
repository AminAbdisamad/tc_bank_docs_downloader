The CBRT Has Updated the Real Effective Exchange Rate Indices
The country weights used in the calculation of the Real Effective Exchange Rate indices
(2003=100), which have been published monthly since July 2010, are based on “2006‐2008”
foreign trade data. However, the increase in the volume of foreign trade and the diversification of
our trading partners have necessitated a new study. For this reason, the Real Effective Exchange
Rate indices published by the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) on its website
(www.tcmb.gov.tr) under the Statistics / Exchange Rates / Real Effective Exchange Rate directory
and available as time series in the EDDS database have been updated.
Accordingly;
• In contrast to the old indices using 2006‐2008 period trade flows for the entire series, the new
indices have been calculated based on three‐year trade flow averages (the 2003‐2005 period, the
2006‐2008 period and the 2009‐2011 period) in compliance with the methodologies of
international organizations. Indices obtained by using the country weights calculated for each
period have been combined by the chain‐linking method.
• The number of countries covered in the indices has been increased from 36 to 45 for CPI‐based
index and from 31 to 38 for PPI‐based index.
• Meanwhile, the Unit Labor Cost‐Based Real Effective Exchange Rate Index, which has not been
updated since the first quarter of 2012 due to the limitations on available data from the
Organisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development (OECD), has been recalculated using
unit labor data of 18 countries published by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat).
