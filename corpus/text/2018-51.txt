Press Release o n the Maximum Interest 
Rates for Credit Cards in Q 1 2019 
29 December  2018, No: 201 8-51 
 
The monthly maximum interest rates that banks can charge on credit card borrowing in the first 
quarter of 201 9 have been left unchanged.  
 
Banks in Turkey, as is the case in other countries, charge higher interest rates for credit card 
borrowing than they do for consumer loans. The CBRT, therefore, advises credit card holders w ith 
short -term credit needs to seek a consumer loan rather than borrowing on personal credit cards.
