Press Release on the Maximum Interest
Rates for Credit Cards in Q1 2019
29 December 2018, No: 2018-51
The monthly maximum interest rates that banks can charge on credit card borrowing in the first
quarter of 2019 have been left unchanged.
Banks in Turkey, as is the case in other countries, charge higher interest rates for credit card
borrowing than they do for consumer loans. The CBRT, therefore, advises credit card holders with
short-term credit needs to seek a consumer loan rather than borrowing on personal credit cards.
