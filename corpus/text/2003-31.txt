PRESS RELEASE ON THE CBRT INTEREST RATE CUTS

I. GENERAL EVALUATION
1. In “Outlook” section of our press release entitled June and Inflation and Outlook”
dated July 4,2003, it was emphasized that:
(i)

downward trend in inflation became more evident with the figures pertaining
to June inflation,

(ii)

developments observed in exchange rates in the last few months and favorable
developments in inflation expectations coupled with the prospective tendency
of these variables in the near future encourages CBRT to think positive about
the future inflation trend,

(iii)

the announcements made by officials were deemed favorable in terms of
conformity with the inflation target, however cost of increase in wages and
salaries exceeding budget targets would create adverse effects on inflation as
these increases will be met by increasing taxes instead of cuts in other
expenditure items,

(iv)

taking into account the above-mentioned points and departing from the
supposition that the program would be implemented without any interruptions,
the most important development that could pose threat to the future trend of
inflation could be the signals about increasing domestic demand, however
actual production, which was still below the potential production level, would
palliate the unfavorable pressure to be exerted by domestic demand on
inflation,

(v)

the negative effect that might arise from demand pressure could be
compensated sufficiently by the recent developments in exchange rates, the
favorable inflation expectations and the strong likelihood of sustenance of
these trends,

(vi)

these favorable developments should not be perceived as a short-sighted
opportunity to increase profit margins by the private sector; long-term interest
should be considered and actions should be taken responsibly,

(vii)

the downward inflation trend achieved could only be stopped by deviations
from the program and it was of utmost importance that fiscal discipline was
maintained and structural reforms were carried on timely and uninterruptedly.

In light of these points, welcoming the above-mentioned developments, the CBRT
warned that any kind of relaxation would be a big economic mistake and departing from the
supposition that no concessions would be allowed in fiscal discipline and structural reform
process, the CBRT envisioned that the favorable developments observed in inflation since
April would continue and the end-year inflation target of 20 percent would be attained.
2. The developments observed since early-July have strengthened the probability that
the fundamental factors determining the inflation will pursue a favorable course in the
following period as well. These developments reinforced the CBRT’s hopeful vision for the
future trend of inflation too. The structural reform process and measures on budget discipline
are the leading ones among these developments. Significant progress was made in concluding
the Fifth Review conducted with the IMF and in effecting the reforms that are essential for the
implementation of the program successfully. Moreover, it is acknowledged that the budget
discipline will mainly be maintained through expense-restrictive measures. This development
is considered to be encouraging with respect to the inflation of the following period.
3. Meanwhile, these favorable developments reflected on the market expectations for
inflation as well. The results of expectation survey for the first half of July point at a
noteworthy decline in inflation expectations. Various econometric models, which are used by
the Central Bank in forecasting inflation for the following period on the assumption that
current fiscal and structural policies will be maintained, produce hopeful results that are
consistent with year-end inflation target. These results are consistent with the improvement in
the market expectations too.
