DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Meeting Date: October 16, 2007
Committee Members
Durmuş Yılmaz (Governor), Erdem Başçı, Burhan Göklemez, M. İbrahim Turhan, Mehmet
Yörükoğlu.

The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) decided to lower the policy rates
as follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate from 17.25 to 16.75 percent, and lending rate
from 22.25 to 21.50 percent,
b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate applied between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00
p.m. from 13.25 to 12.75 percent, lending rate from 25.25 to 24.50 percent,
c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for
primary dealers via repo transactions from 21.25 to 20.50 percent.
Readings on economic activity and inflation are in line with the outlook presented in the
July Inflation Report. While private consumption and investment demand exhibits signs of
recovery, external demand moderates. Aggregate demand conditions continue to support the
disinflation process. Services inflation continues its favorable course. Notwithstanding the risks
related to energy, food, and administered prices, inflation is expected to decelerate owing to the
lagged effects of strong monetary tightening.
The Committee closely monitors the developments in international liquidity conditions and
credit markets. September rate cut decision led to a significant fall in both the medium and longterm interest rates, reducing the downward risks on medium term inflation posed by global
economic developments.
In light of these developments, the Committee decided to continue the measured rate
cuts. The Committee underlines that the current level of the short-term interest rates remains
restrictive even after the recent policy rate cuts. The Committee assesses that, under the current
policy stance envisaging a measured and cautious rate cut cycle, the risks on attaining the
inflation target in the medium term are balanced. The timing and extent of further easing will
depend on the incoming information regarding global liquidity conditions, external demand,
public expenditures and other determinants of the medium term inflation outlook.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook
will lead the Committee to reconsider its stance.
Considering the downward trend in interest rates, the Committee decided to narrow the
gap between borrowing and lending rates in order to limit the extent of potential fluctuations in
overnight interest rates. In this regard, borrowing rates are reduced by 50 basis points, while
lending rates are cut by 75 basis points. It should be noted, however, that the additional cut in
lending rates is merely a technical adjustment.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight
working days.
