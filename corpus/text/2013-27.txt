PRESS RELEASE ON OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS
Based on the projected Turkish lira liquidity needs, the Monetary Policy Committee
(MPC) decided, at its meeting of 18 June 2013, to set the amount of daily funding via
one-week quantity auctions between 0.2 and 9 billion Turkish liras, effective from 19
June 2013.
As for one-month repo auctions, the upper limit for each auction has been set as 0.5
billion Turkish liras, effective from 19 June 2013.
In the coming months, if any changes in the lower and the upper limit of funding
amount provided via one-week quantity auctions and the upper limit of the funding
amount provided via one-month repo auctions are needed, these changes will be
announced to the public with a new press release. Otherwise, there won’t be any
press release.
According to the announcements released on 11 June 2013, the CBRT may opt to
provide funds outside these pre-announced limits.
