PRESS RELEASE 
  
The interest rate on TL required reserves is decrea sed to 23 percent, by 
cutting 2 percentage points, to be effective from 1 9 August 2003. 
With the aim of contributing to the efficient and e ffective functioning of banks 
by alleviating their financial intermediation costs , TL required reserves and FX required 
reserves have begun to be remunerated starting from  8.8.2001 and from 24.5.2002 
respectively, in order to reduce the funding costs of required reserves maintained in 
the Central Bank without being remunerated. 
The interest rate applied to TL required reserves w as determined as 25 percent 
to be effective from 9.7.2002 and it was announced that this rate would be revised in 
line with the developments.    
During the last one-year period, simple weighted av erage interest rate applied by 
banks for Turkish lira denominated deposits has fal len significantly, and overnight 
borrowing rate applied at CBRT Interbank Money Mark et has been reduced. Considering 
the continuation of this downward trend, the intere st rate on TL required reserves has 
been set as 23 percent, with a cut of 2 percentage points, to be effective from 19 
August 2003.     
The interest rate applied to TL required reserves i s held in the range between 
75 to 80 percent of the simple weighted average int erest rate for Turkish lira 
denominated deposits and determined in line with th e changes in interest rates applied 
by banks on deposits. 
As before, the interest rate applicable to FX requi red reserves shall continue to 
be determined weekly, and shall be equivalent to th e interest rate on 2-days notice FX 
deposits that the banks hold as free deposits with the Central Bank.
