PRESS RELEASE

The interest rate on TL required reserves is decreased to 23 percent, by
cutting 2 percentage points, to be effective from 19 August 2003.
With the aim of contributing to the efficient and effective functioning of banks
by alleviating their financial intermediation costs, TL required reserves and FX required
reserves have begun to be remunerated starting from 8.8.2001 and from 24.5.2002
respectively, in order to reduce the funding costs of required reserves maintained in
the Central Bank without being remunerated.
The interest rate applied to TL required reserves was determined as 25 percent
to be effective from 9.7.2002 and it was announced that this rate would be revised in
line with the developments.
During the last one-year period, simple weighted average interest rate applied by
banks for Turkish lira denominated deposits has fallen significantly, and overnight
borrowing rate applied at CBRT Interbank Money Market has been reduced. Considering
the continuation of this downward trend, the interest rate on TL required reserves has
been set as 23 percent, with a cut of 2 percentage points, to be effective from 19
August 2003.
The interest rate applied to TL required reserves is held in the range between
75 to 80 percent of the simple weighted average interest rate for Turkish lira
denominated deposits and determined in line with the changes in interest rates applied
by banks on deposits.
As before, the interest rate applicable to FX required reserves shall continue to
be determined weekly, and shall be equivalent to the interest rate on 2-days notice FX
deposits that the banks hold as free deposits with the Central Bank.
