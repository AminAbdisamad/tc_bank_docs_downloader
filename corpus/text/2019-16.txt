Decision of the Monetary Policy Committee  
April  25, 2019, No: 201 9-16

The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the policy rate (one- week repo 
auction rate) constant at 24 percent.  
Recently released data show that rebalancing trend in the econom y has continued. External demand  
maintains its relative strength  while economic activity  displays a slow pace , partly due to tight financial 
conditions . Current account balance is expected to maintain its improving trend.  
Developments in domestic demand conditions  have led to some  improvement in inflation indicators. Yet, 
higher food and import prices and the elevated course of inflation expectations point to continued risks 
to pric e stability . Accordingly, the Committee has decided to maintain the tight  monetary policy stance  
until  inflation outlook displays a significant improvement . 
The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. 
Factors affecting inflatio n will be closely monitored and monetary stance will be determined to keep 
inflation in line with the targeted path.   
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.  
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days.
