SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: August 19, 2010

Inflation Developments
1. Consumer prices decreased by 0.48 percent in July and annual inflation
declined by 0.79 percentage points to 7.58 percent. The fall in annual inflation
was largely due to the base effects from the tax hikes on tobacco and durable
goods a year ago, as noted in the July summary of the Monetary Policy
Committee (the Committee) Meeting. Annual services and core goods inflation
continued to moderate and core inflation indicators remained in line with
medium-term targets.
2. Unprocessed food prices continued to fall in July, albeit at a slower pace than
in the past two months, and annual food inflation declined to 5.52 percent. The
changes in food prices were mainly attributable to the seasonal drop in
vegetable prices, while meat prices were back on the rise after a two-month
break. Accordingly, the contribution of meat prices to annual inflation
increased to 1.6 percentage points. Observations for August suggest that the
annual rate of increase in unprocessed food prices may accelerate because of
higher fruit prices. The lowering of customs duties on imported livestock is
expected to contain the unprocessed food inflation over the remainder of the
year.
3. Annual services inflation continues to trend downwards. In seasonally adjusted
terms, inflation across all services categories is seen to be slowing down. The
favorable developments in food and energy prices ease the cost pressures on
services prices. The annual rate of increase in services prices, excluding the
relatively more demand-sensitive catering and transport services, dropped to
3.46 percent, an all-time low since the inception of the CPI.
4. Energy prices remained flat in July. Fuel prices remained broadly unchanged
in line with international oil prices, while solid fuel prices continued to rise,
albeit more slowly. The annual rate of increase in energy prices is expected to
fall in coming months due to base effects.
5. The year-on-year rate of increase in core goods (goods excluding food,
energy, alcoholic beverages, tobacco and gold) slowed to 3.74 percent owing
to the base effects from last year’s tax cuts on durable goods. Moreover, the

tax-adjusted annual rate of increase in core goods prices remained unchanged
at 2.4 percent.
6. The Committee has noted that the recent increase in international wheat and
cotton prices would have implications for consumer prices, particularly for food
prices and the clothing industry, respectively. In fact, annual inflation in
clothing prices has been on an uptrend recently. On the other hand, in view of
domestic wheat production estimates and available domestic stocks, the
Committee expects that rising international wheat prices would have a limited
impact on inflation.
7. On balance, the Committee has reiterated that inflation would increase
temporarily in the short term before reverting back to a declining path by the
last quarter of the year.

Factors Affecting Inflation
8. Recent data suggest that the recovery in economic activity has slowed down.
With the waning recovery, industrial production fell by 2.1 percentage points
month-on-month in June, which is the deepest monthly contraction since April
2009. The Committee has emphasized that the contraction has been more
pronounced in manufacturing industries which are sensitive to foreign
demand.
9. July’s survey indicators show an ongoing decline in industrial orders
expectations. Despite having increased month-on-month in July, capacity
utilization rates continue to hover around low levels. Therefore, the Committee
has concluded that the June drop in production is temporary, but that
downside risks regarding the pace of recovery remain.
10. Domestic demand displays a relatively stable outlook. Second-quarter data on
production and imports indicate that private consumption demand slowed
quarter-on-quarter. The recent flattening of July’s survey indicators and
consumer confidence indices shows that there has not been a surge in
consumer spending as of the early part of the third quarter. Yet, the
Committee has noted that the May-July data largely reflect the effects of the
euro area debt crisis, and therefore the slowdown in domestic demand may be
transitory. In fact, the steady increase in consumer loans during July shows
that monetary conditions remain accommodative.
11. Investment demand continues to recover, but remains below pre-crisis levels.
The production of capital goods excluding vehicles and the imports of capital
goods continue to grow. Production and imports data suggest that private
investments would increase significantly year-on-year during the second

quarter of 2010. Yet, the Committee has stated that the recently increased
uncertainty about the pace of recovery in foreign demand might dampen new
investments, particularly in the manufacturing industry.
12. There are signs of a moderate slowdown in foreign demand. The Committee,
in its previous meeting, had emphasized the potential impacts of the adverse
developments across key export destinations on economic activity. In fact, the
export quantity index excluding gold declined markedly in June following a rise
for four consecutive months. Recent foreign trade data suggest that exports
remained relatively weak in July and August. Moreover, survey indicators of
manufacturing industry do not indicate a significant acceleration in export
orders. Therefore, the Committee expects that it would take a while before
industrial capacity utilization rates return to their pre-crisis levels.
13. Although employment conditions continue to improve, unemployment rates
remain at elevated levels. Seasonally adjusted data indicate that non-farm
employment continued to recover in May, albeit more slowly. The employment
recovery was primarily driven by the industrial sector, while employment
growth in services slowed down. The Committee has noted that the weaker
foreign demand conditions could dampen the labor market and thus the
recovery in domestic demand in coming months. In this respect, the
Committee has reiterated that the unemployment rates would continue to
remain at higher levels compared to pre-crisis period for sometime, containing
the unit labor costs.

Monetary Policy and Risks
14. The Committee has assessed that recent data releases are in line with the
outlook presented in the July Inflation Report. Although domestic demand has
slowed down moderately since April owing to the problems in the euro area, it
is expected that domestic demand would continue to display a relatively stable
outlook bolstered by the supportive monetary conditions. Recent credit
surveys on the second quarter suggest that demand for both consumer and
commercial loans has continued to increase. Moreover, ongoing deposit
growth and improving conditions regarding banks’ access to external credit are
supportive for credit expansion.
15. The Committee has restated that inflation would increase temporarily in the
near term before reverting to a declining path starting from the last quarter of
the year. Inflation is expected to display a significant rise in August due to
sharp increases in fruit prices, but then trend downwards in the last quarter
with the support of a reversal in last year’s food price base effects. Core

inflation indicators are expected to remain consistent with the medium-term
targets.
16. In light of these developments, the Committee reiterated that it would be
necessary to maintain policy rates at current levels for some time, and to keep
them at low levels for a long period.
17. Risks regarding the global economy remain. Data releases on global
economic activity have increased the uncertainties regarding the pace of the
recovery. Ongoing problems in credit, real estate and labor markets across
developed economies, with concerns regarding the sustainability of public debt
decreasing the room for countercyclical policy are key factors underpinning the
downside risks regarding global economic activity. The Committee members
have stated that, should problems in the global economy further intensify,
thereby increasing the possibility of a domestic recession, a new easing cycle
may be considered.
18. The Committee has assessed that conditions are appropriate to gradually
implement the measures outlined in the exit strategy as envisaged. However,
there are risks that could necessitate bringing forward or delaying the
measures outlined in the exit strategy. Recently, strengthening perceptions
that developed economies will keep their policy rates at low levels for a long
period, together with ample liquidity conditions have led to a surge in capital
flows toward emerging markets. Given the relative improvement in the
creditworthiness of Turkey during the post-crisis period, it is possible that
capital inflows may further increase in the forthcoming period. Such a
development would exacerbate the divergence between the pace of recovery
in the domestic demand and external demand. If this pattern of growth
coexists with rapid credit expansion and a deterioration in the current account
balance, consequently leading to financial stability concerns, it would be
necessary to utilize other policy instruments such as reserve requirement
ratios and liquidity tools more effectively. Accordingly, the Committee may
bring forward the measures outlined in the exit strategy that were envisaged to
be implemented by end-2010. By contrast, should the uncertainties regarding
global economy intensify and consequently dampen domestic demand, these
measures may be implemented at a later period.
19. The Committee has indicated that recent volatility in commodity prices pose
risks regarding short-term inflation forecasts. Although ongoing uncertainties
regarding the global economy continue to suppress energy and industrial
metal prices, climate conditions are having an adverse impact on agricultural
commodities. In fact, recently, the prices of wheat and cotton, which are
important inputs for core consumer goods, have displayed rapid increases. At
this stage, the Committee does not view these developments as a threat

toward attaining the medium-term targets, but acknowledges the need to
monitor commodity prices closely.
20. The Central Bank monitors fiscal policy developments closely while
formulating monetary policy. The Committee members have indicated that the
delay in the enactment of the fiscal rule has increased the importance of
current fiscal policy implementation. Budget realizations in the first half of 2010
suggest that the better-than-expected performance in budget revenues, due to
stronger economic activity than envisaged in the Medium Term Program
(MTP), is largely being used to reduce government debt. Sustaining fiscal
discipline in the period ahead as well is crucial, both in terms of providing more
flexibility regarding the conduct of countercyclical monetary policy, and also for
keeping the market interest rates at low levels permanently. In this respect, the
Committee will continue to monitor the fiscal developments and their impact on
inflation outlook closely. Should fiscal discipline be implemented through
institutional and structural improvements, rather than indirect tax hikes, it
would be possible to keep policy rates at single-digit levels over the mediumterm.
21. Monetary policy will continue to focus on price stability in the period ahead.
Strengthening the commitment to fiscal discipline and the structural reform
agenda would support the improvement of Turkey’s sovereign risk, and thus
facilitate macroeconomic and price stability. In this respect, timely
implementation of the structural reforms envisaged by the MTP and the
European Union accession process remains to be of utmost importance.
