SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: August 14, 2007
Inflation Developments
1. Consumer prices fell by 0.73 percent in July, bringing annual inflation rate
down to 6.90 percent. The cumulative decline in annual inflation over the past
four months reached 4 percentage points.
2. Annual inflation in both the processed and unprocessed food groups
decreased in July. Despite the rise in annual inflation in vegetable prices in
July, annual inflation in the unprocessed food group declined to 8.92 percent,
down by 4.3 percentage points from the previous month, thanks to continued
correction in fruit prices. Meanwhile, annual inflation in processed food prices
fell by 0.53 percentage points due to primarily last year’s base effect. In the
second half of 2006, processed food prices had surged significantly because
of the pass-through from depreciation in the local currency (YTL) and owing to
price movements mostly in the bread and cereal products group.
3. Price developments in the energy group supported the disinflation process in
July. Despite the high level of crude oil prices in international markets,
domestic fuel prices displayed a decline on the back of strong YTL. In addition,
the favorable trend in the prices of utilities and other energy items for housing
group continued.
4. Consumer durables prices, which displayed a downward trend in April-June
period, continued this favorable course in July as well and annual inflation in
this group came down to minus 2.15 percent. Another noteworthy
development in July was the downturn in the annual inflation of clothing and
footwear prices, after a period of successive price increases in the first half of
2007.
5. The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) noted the favorable
developments in services inflation since early 2007. The slowdown in annual
services inflation became more pronounced in July. The monthly inflation rates
have declined in all sub-groups (rent, restaurants-hotels, transportation and all
other services) compared to the same month of the previous year. Annual
services inflation fell by 2 percentage points in the first seven months of 2007,
the restaurants-hotels group contributed most to this decline. The lowest
annual inflation among the main service expenditure groups was observed in

communication services with 3.50 percent. The impact of the rate cut in local
calls on communication services prices in late July will be observed largely in
August.
6. Notwithstanding the risks related to energy and food prices, inflation continues
to decelerate owing to the lagged effects of the strong monetary tightening.
Annual inflation in all core measures declined in July. This was mainly driven
by the favorable price developments for durable goods and services. The
downward trend in the annual rate of increase of the mostly cited core
indicator-H (CPI excluding food, energy, alcohol-tobacco and gold) became
more evident in July. The seasonally adjusted monthly inflation measured by
using this index continued to slow down.
7. On the other hand, the Committee emphasized that the decline in
unprocessed food prices observed last year in August may not recur this year,
and consequently noted that food prices and the annual inflation rate might
display a temporary rise in August.
Factors Affecting Inflation
8. The Committee assessed that the recent data on economic activity and
inflation are consistent with the outlook presented in the July Inflation Report.
While private sector investment and consumption demand exhibit signs of
recovery, external demand is moderating and aggregate demand conditions
continue to support the disinflation process.
9. Leading indicators for the second quarter of the year suggest that private
consumption expenditures displayed a trend similar to the one in the first
quarter. The slowdown in domestic sales of white goods observed since the
third quarter of last year continued in the second quarter of 2007 as well.
Similarly, domestic sales of automobiles and imports of consumer goods
slowed down during this period. Moreover, the pace of real growth in
consumer loans was moderate compared to the first half of 2006. Hence,
private consumption spending, in seasonally adjusted terms, is expected to
increase moderately in the second quarter of the year compared to the first
quarter. On the other hand, June and July data on domestic sales of
automobiles, various consumption indices and domestic sales of commercial
vehicles point to a recovery in private investment and consumption demand,
starting from the third quarter of the year.
10. Investment spending displayed a moderate growth trend. While imports of
capital goods and production of electrical machinery increased in the second
quarter of the year, machinery-equipment production and sales of light and
heavy commercial vehicles decreased in seasonally adjusted terms compared
to the first quarter. Meanwhile, the fall in construction permits in the first

quarter compared to the same period of the previous year signals a relative
slowdown in construction sector. However, the construction investments may
continue to display high growth rates throughout the year, since current
construction investments are closely related to past construction permits.
11. In the first half of 2007, non-interest budget expenditures increased noticeably
by 25.7 percent compared to the same period of 2006. This development
indicates that public expenditures in recent months may have restrained the
disinflation process. Based on the projected end-year budget targets, noninterest public expenditures are expected to slow down significantly in the
second half of the year. Thus, it is likely that the stimulus from the public
expenditures to the aggregate demand may cease in the second half of 2007.
It is of critical importance for the continuity of disinflation process that potential
measures that may be taken to achieve the program-defined non-interest
budget targets would be implemented by cutting expenditures rather than tax
adjustments and that incomes policy for 2008 is conducted in harmony with
the medium-term inflation targets.
12. External demand maintained its strong course in the second quarter of the
year. In this period, exports increased by 13.2 percent in annual terms.
According to the data announced by the Turkish Exporters Assembly, the
strong performance of exports continued in July as well. The robust course of
external demand and the competitive advantage brought by productivity gains
are expected to support export growth in the near future. However, it is
expected that the strong base effect that will be effective from September
onwards will restrain annual growth rate of exports.
13. The strong performance of exports has supported industrial production.
Although year-over-year industrial production increased only modestly in June
due to the high base in the same period of 2006, seasonally adjusted data
point to a moderate growth in the second quarter of the year compared to the
previous quarter.
Monetary Policy and Risks
14. Domestic demand has significantly slowed down after the monetary tightening
in 2006. The slowdown in domestic demand is affecting inflation with a lag.
This effect is particularly noticeable in services prices. Although domestic
demand may partly recover in the second half of the year, aggregate demand
conditions are expected to support the disinflation process—thanks to
declining contribution of net exports and the government spending. Therefore,
the underlying disinflation is expected to continue in the upcoming period.
However, significant risks remain to the inflation outlook on both sides:

15. Volatile food prices lead to unpredictable movements in headline inflation.
Moreover, bad crop of wheat poses risks on the consumer prices through the
prices of bread and grain products. The Central Bank does not react to the
temporary movements in unprocessed food prices, however closely monitors
these developments since they can effect inflation expectations. It should also
be noted that the risks posed by the food prices are not one sided, as the base
effects may result in favorable surprises in the forthcoming period.
16. The stickiness in inflation expectations is considered as an important risk to
the inflation outlook. Although the headline inflation has been easing down
significantly in the past four months, inflation expectations of financial market
participants have not shown any improvement. Corporate sector expectations
are still significantly above the medium term targets despite the downward
trend in the past couple of months. The prevailing gap between medium term
inflation expectations and the targets poses uncertainties on the wage setting
behavior—especially in the public sector—and hence the service prices,
pointing to the risk of a slower-than-envisaged pace of disinflation.
Materialization of such a risk could result in a more cautious policy than stated
in the July Inflation Report.
17. The Committee closely monitors the developments in the international liquidity
conditions and the credit markets. Recent market volatility has the potential to
effect inflation through several distinct channels: In the short term the
depreciation in domestic currency and the subsequent pass-through may have
an inflationary impact, although this impact would partly be offset by the
decline in oil and other commodity prices driven by rising concerns over the
outlook for global growth. On the other hand, the recent developments in the
international liquidity conditions and the credit markets will contain the
downward trend in the bank lending rates, and also curb the banks’ appetite
for extending credit. Accordingly, likelihood of the materialization of the risk
that “domestic demand conditions may turn less supportive for the disinflation
process, once the prevailing uncertainties fade out and the long-term interest
rates continue to decline during the second half of the year”, as quoted in the
last months Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting, has been
reduced.
18. In this respect, the Committee, as of the meeting date, maintained the policy
stance outlined in the Inflation Report, and thus envisioned a measured easing
starting from the last quarter of 2007. However, the Committe added that the
exact timing and the extent of the easing may vary depending on the incoming
information regarding global liquidity conditions, external demand, public
expenditures and other determinants of medium term inflation outlook.

19. The developments in the global markets and their reflections on the domestic
markets are closely monitored. The Central Bank will utilize the available tools
to mitigate the adverse impact of developments in the global markets on the
inflation outlook. Within this framework, the Committee, during the meeting,
also assessed liquidity developments in the domestic money market, and
evaluated liquidity management strategies. The YTL liquidity is expected to be
at sufficient levels in the forthcoming period. However, barring extraordinary
market fluctuations, the Central Bank, by using existing open market operation
tools, may regulate the liquidity levels on both sides when needed, to ensure
that the overnight rates in the money market stay close to the Central Bank
borrowing rates.
20. Prudent monetary policy is necessary but not sufficient for securing the
resilience of the economy to global shocks. The role of fiscal policy and
structural reforms are also critical in this process. In this respect, the European
Union accession process and the implementation of the structural reforms
envisaged in the economic program remain to be important for long-term
stability. Particularly, advances in structural reforms that would enhance the
quality of fiscal discipline are monitored closely with regard to their effects on
both macroeconomic and price stability.
