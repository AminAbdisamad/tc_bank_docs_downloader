PRESS RELEASE  
ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE INTERVENTION  
OF THE CENTRAL BANK  
  
The Central Bank has announced through several press releases that under the floating 
exchange rate regime, the level of exchange rate is determined by supply and demand conditions 
in the currency markets, the volatility in the exchange rate is being closely monitored by the 
Central Bank, and the Central Bank may directly intervene  in the markets in the event of an 
excessive volatility that might occur in either direction.  In this framework, the Central Bank 
directly intervened in the markets by buying foreign currency on 3 June 2005 due to excessive 
volatility in exchange rates.  
 
Recently, excessive volatility has been observed in exchange rates again. The volatility in 
the value of Turkish lira against the US dollar in particular has become more apparent in the 
face of concurrent appreciation of the US dollar in the international m arkets. Therefore, the 
Central Bank has decided to directly intervene in the markets today by buying foreign currency 
in order to prevent the excessive volatility.
