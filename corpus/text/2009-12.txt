SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: March 19, 2009
Inflation Developments
1. Consumer prices decreased by 0.34 percent in February, pushing inflation
down to 7.73 percent year-on-year. The marked slowdown in economic activity
and the changes in oil and other commodity prices continued to help bring
inflation down and curb short-term exchange rate pass-through.
2. Energy prices dropped by 0.82 percent in February, and annual inflation in this
subgroup eased to 13.74 percent, chiefly owing to falling natural gas and solid
fuel prices. Yet, the exchange rate-driven sharp rise in fuel and bottled gas
prices limited the downtrend in energy price inflation.
3. The rate of increase in unprocessed food prices was up by a very modest 0.85
percent in February. Accordingly, after having soared because of the sharp
rise in vegetable prices over the past four months, unprocessed food price
inflation slumped to 0.63 percent year-on-year owing to the dramatic decline in
fresh fruit and vegetable prices. Meanwhile, processed food prices continued
to decline at a faster pace. The group’s prices dropped by 0.68 percent monthon-month, largely due to falling bread and grain prices. With the significant
softening in both processed and unprocessed food prices, annual food and
nonalcoholic beverages inflation fell to 6.16 percent.
4. The annual rate of increase in processed food prices is expected to slow down
further in coming months. However, changes in vegetable prices may cause a
temporary spike in unprocessed food prices during March. The Monetary
Policy Committee (the Committee) noted that the anticipated rise in
unprocessed food prices, as well as the observed increase in prices of
tobacco products in March, would likely have an adverse impact on consumer
inflation, yet will not cause any deterioration in the underlying inflation trend as
price hikes in both groups are expected to be short-lived.
5. Annual inflation in goods excluding energy and food increased by 0.46 points
from January to 5.20 percent in February on the back of changes in clothing
and gold prices. However, in the durables group (excluding gold), annual
inflation went down by 0.18 points month-on-month. Producer prices for
durable goods fell for the third consecutive month, partly due to changes in
import prices, while aggregate demand conditions continued to soften. As a

result, exchange rate pass-through on prices of durable goods remained low
compared to previous periods.
6. The reduction in the Special Consumption Tax (SCT) in March is likely to have
some downward pressure on the prices of durable goods in March and April,
but is expected to be offset by price increases as the tax cut expires in the
middle of June. Therefore, the SCT tax cut is expected to have only a
temporary direct impact on inflation. Similarly, the SCT tax cut may cause a
temporary downward shift in core inflation indicators as well.
7. Services prices recorded the first monthly decline since the inception of the
index, albeit a modest one, and the group’s annual inflation dropped by 0.62
points from January to 9.27 percent in February. The fact that the slowdown
was evident across all subcategories is viewed as a favorable development.
The continued fall in the rate of increase in services prices and other key price
indicators suggests that underlying inflation is on a downward trend.
8. Overall, the Committee expects annual consumer inflation to rise temporarily
in March owing to soaring unprocessed food prices, but then to continue its
downtrend.

Factors Affecting Inflation
9. Recent readings suggest that economic activity continues to weaken.
Industrial production, which dropped by 21.3 percent year-on-year in January
2009, displayed a sharp contraction from a month ago in seasonally adjusted
terms. Readings on capacity utilization, electricity consumption and exports
point to a further significant year-on-year decline in industrial production in
February. Seasonally adjusted data for January and February indicate that
economic activity continues to decline in the first quarter.
10. Recent data releases indicate that consumer sentiment has recovered
somewhat from a quarter ago but remains subdued. Although automobile
sales and consumer confidence indices displayed a partial rebound in the first
months of 2009, these indicators remain at relatively depressed levels by
historical standards. Low production figures despite rebounding orders and
sales reflect the ongoing depletion of inventories.
11. Labor market readings confirm the sharp weakening of economic activity.
Between November 2008 and January 2009, unemployment increased by 3
points from a year earlier to 13.6 percent. In the same period, non-farm
unemployment rose by 4.3 points to 17.3 percent. The Committee noted that
the rise in unemployment is partly due to increased labor force participation,
but emphasized that the main driver was the slowdown in employment growth.

The number of people receiving unemployment benefits continued to rise in
February and it is evident that it will take some time for economic activity to
recover. These developments suggest that unemployment will increase further
during the first quarter. On balance, the downward pressure on unit labor costs
will continue.
12. Foreign demand continues to remain weak in the first quarter. Although data
released by the Turkish Exporters’ Assembly and leading indicators for export
orders indicate no further deterioration in February and March, the Committee,
in view of the global economic outlook, expects that aggregate demand is not
likely to recover soon.

Monetary Policy and Risks
13. Recent monetary and fiscal policy actions are likely to provide some stimulus
to domestic demand, accelerating the depletion of inventories and thus
partially adding to the exchange rate pass-through on the prices of durable
goods. However, the Committee underscored that monetary policy would not
react to changes in relative prices stemming from exchange rate movements,
as long as it does not lead to a deterioration in overall price setting behavior.
Second round effects should not be a source of concern at this point, given
the significant weakness in non-farm employment and the economic outlook.
14. The Committee indicated that the rate cuts so far had lowered the probability
of significantly undershooting the end-year inflation target, and hence the next
rate cut might be measured. However, it was also stated that tightness in
financial conditions still persisted to some extent, and uncertainties regarding
the impact of financial turbulence on the real economy remained high,
suggesting that downside risks still remained. Although consumer credits and
other domestic demand indicators suggest a slight rebound, business loans
continue to stagnate.
15. Problems in international credit markets persist while forecasts of global
economic growth have been consistently revised downwards. The global
economic outlook continues to deteriorate and the recession is expected to be
long lasting. In this respect, the Committee members indicated that the
likelihood of an early recovery in the global economy, envisaged as an
alternative scenario in the January Inflation Report, had almost diminished.
Therefore, expecting that economic activity is not likely to recover anytime
soon, the Committee stated that it might be necessary for monetary policy to
maintain an easing bias for a considerable period.
16. The Committee members suggested that the reduced global appetite for risk
and the expected slowdown in capital flows to emerging markets could be

taken into account regarding monetary policy decisions. Yet, it was
emphasized that the sharp contraction in investment demand and the rapidly
shrinking current account deficit led to a significant drop in financing
requirements.
17. The Committee members have noted that budget revenues have been
declining in line with the slowdown in economic activity while expenditures
have been accelerating due to counter cyclical fiscal policy. It was stated that
some easing in fiscal policy is understandable under the current conditions.
However, the Committee indicated that the increasing financing requirement of
the government might weaken the impact of monetary policy decisions on
economic activity. Accordingly, in order to reap the gains from short-term
expansionary fiscal policy, it is important to commit to a credible medium-term
fiscal framework that would ensure debt sustainability and a sound overall
fiscal position.
18. The Central Bank will continue to take the necessary measures to contain the
adverse effects of the global financial turmoil on the domestic economy,
provided that they do not conflict with the price stability objective. Prudent
monetary policy is necessary but not sufficient to maintain the resilience of the
economy against the global crisis. Therefore, strengthening the commitment to
fiscal discipline and the structural reform agenda is also critical for facilitating
expectations management and for enhancing the simulative impact of the
monetary accommodation. In this respect, commitment to the European Union
accession process, and timely implementation and revision of the structural
reforms envisaged in the Medium Term Program remain to be of utmost
importance.
