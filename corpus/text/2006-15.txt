SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE DISCUSSIONS
Meeting Date: 23 March 2006

Inflation Developments
In February, the CPI index increased by 0.22 percent compared to the previous
month and 8.15 percent compared to the same period of the previous year. Hence,
inflation displayed a limited increase. Since this was an expected development as
described in the Inflation Report, inflation figures in February did not necessitate a
major change in the medium-term perspective of monetary policy.
In February, the increase in food prices was the main factor that affected
inflation negatively. The main determinant of these price increases, which registered
an increase above expectations, can be attributed to the prices of fresh vegetables,
which increased significantly due to adverse weather conditions. The 0.58 percentage
points of consumer prices, which increased by 0.97 percent in the first two months of
the year, was derived from fresh vegetable prices. This development is expected to be
temporary. It is also anticipated that the negative impact of the increase in food prices
on inflation will weaken in March. Meanwhile, clothing prices continued to decline in
February due to seasonal impacts. The fact that winter sale discounts are higher in this
group compared to the previous year shows that demand and competition conditions
continue to support the decline in inflation. Clothing prices are expected to have a
positive impact on consumer prices in March owing to the VAT cuts made in the
textile, ready-to-wear and leather sectors from 18 percent to 8 percent.
In February, the developments in the Special CPI Aggregates displayed a
positive outlook. Especially the special aggregates E, F and G, which exclude the
alcoholic beverages, tobacco products and energy items, maintained a downward
trend in the last three quarters and increases in the said indices remained below 7
percent. These developments indicate that the downward trend of inflation continues.
Although current inflation is above 8 percent, expectations regarding 2007 indicate
lower levels and support the downward trend of inflation.
Producer prices maintained their favorable course. Meanwhile, the increase
made in prices of natural gas used in industry has had a negative impact on production
costs. The annual increase observed in the manufacturing industry price index, which
is calculated by excluding petroleum and tobacco products, maintained its historically
low level.
The prices of services continue to be an important risk factor for the
attainability of the inflation target set for 2006. Services items increased the said risk,
as their share in the CPI was increased by the updates in 2006. Meanwhile, it should
be noted that the annual rates of increase in services items that are susceptible to oil

prices have displayed a downward trend. There is no doubt that the course of the rates
of increase in the said sub-items will depend on the course of crude oil prices in the
upcoming period.
In light of these evaluations, it is foreseen that inflation will start to register a
downward trend as of the upcoming month.
Factors Affecting Inflation
In previous Monetary Policy Committee Discussions, the deterioration trend in
domestic demand and production indicators were mainly attributed to the very long
religious holiday. Meanwhile, the unfavorable trend in industrial production
exceeding seasonal factors is believed to have stemmed from natural gas cuts in the
month in question. Actually, the favorable trend in production, volume of orders from
the domestic market, volume of goods sold in the domestic market and volume of
work in progress over the next three months signals that the slowdown in demand and
production is not permanent. Moreover, according to the Manufacturing Industry
Tendency Survey, the decline in the number of participants who stated that the reason
behind working below capacity was the lack of demand in the market. The Real
Sector Confidence Index, which is an important indicator with respect to industrial
production, also maintained its stable trend in February. To sum up, data pertaining to
domestic sales of automobiles, vehicle loans, consumption indices and consumption
goods imports indicate that the stable course in demand and production indicators
continues.
Although the stable trend in investment continues, recent developments in
domestic sales of commercial vehicles and developments in sectors producing
machinery-equipment, office machinery, electrical machinery and electrical
appliances indicate that the rapid rise in investment expenditures might slow down in
the upcoming period. However, due to the reasons explained above, it should be borne
in mind that the developments in January and February might be temporary. Actually,
despite the decline in production, the upward trend in imports of capital goods shows
that investment expenditures still continue. However, data to be released in the
coming months will provide a clearer view.
Besides the data pertaining to investments in machinery-equipment, recent
developments in sectors providing intermediate input for the construction sector
points to the fact that the increased activity observed in the construction sector at the
beginning of 2005 slowed down relatively as of the second half of 2005. However,
when the level of production of non-metallic minerals, according to seasonally
adjusted data, and the strong demand for houses are taken into account, it is projected
that the rise in production in the construction sector will continue. The sustained rapid
rise in housing loans also supports this trend. When the data pertaining to housing
permits in the third quarter of 2005 are analyzed, it is observed that the rise in housing
construction continues. To summarize, even if no upward movement is observed in
the said data, indicators pertaining to machinery-equipment and construction sectors
provide information that the stable rise in investment demand would continue, at least
in the short-run.
One significant point regarding total demand developments is the fact that
exports once again started to increase in March. The sustained upward trend in

expectations for the volume of goods to be exported in the next three months and new
orders received from the exports market according to the Business Tendency Survey,
coupled with the leading indicators announced, signal that the rise in foreign demand
will continue even if at a slower pace. Meanwhile, it is projected that the upward
trend in imports would also continue and the contribution of net foreign demand to
domestic added value would remain limited in the near future.
Although consumer loans maintain their high levels, the annual rates of
increase, excluding housing credits, displayed a stable trend in the last period. This is
considered to be an indicator of the stability of the increase in domestic demand.
There is no doubt that the increases in housing credits, which stemmed from structural
factors, might continue in subsequent years. Moreover, the decline observed in the
public borrowing requirement in recent years is expected to continue to underpin both
the consumer and corporate credit supply. Rapid credit expansion is taken as a
development that should be monitored closely in terms of both price and financial
stability.
To sum up, the evaluations regarding supply and demand conditions point to
the fact that the stagnation observed at the start of the year was temporary and that the
increase in total demand maintains its stable course. Although employment, excluding
the agricultural sector, has rapidly increased in a stable manner since the second
quarter of 2004, the continuance of productivity increases in line with the investmentbased growth and structural reform process restricts cost pressures. However, it is
expected that the support of supply and demand conditions in the disinflation process
will be limited in the upcoming period compared to previous years.
Developments in crude oil prices stood as the leading factor in terms of
production costs. In recent months, the continuation of the unforeseen volatility in oil
prices confirms that oil prices remain as a significant risk factor in terms of the
achievability of the inflation target in 2006. Moreover, the fact that the International
Metal Prices Index registered high increases on an annual basis constitutes another
risk factor.
The risks to the inflation outlook arising from likely fluctuations in
international liquidity conditions and global risk appetite are always present. The
financing structure of the current account deficit has tended to grow stronger recently,
which means that the resilience to fluctuations in international liquidity conditions has
started to increase. Nevertheless, maintaining structural adjustments in a determined
manner and avoiding implementations that would increase perceptions of uncertainty
are still critical under current conditions.
Monetary Policy
In the light of the developments summarized above, the Monetary Policy
Committee has concluded that recent developments, while supporting short-term
inflation forecasts, do not significantly change the medium-term outlook outlined in
the Inflation Report. It is expected that the cut in Value Added Tax rates in the textile,
ready-wear and leather sectors, the ongoing productivity increases in the
manufacturing industry and the fact that the secondary effects of oil price increases
continue to remain limited will favorably affect inflation in the short-term. In light of
these developments, it is estimated that the downward trend in annual inflation will

resume starting in March, and end-year inflation will come closer to the point target
of 5 percent. However, the cautious approach of monetary policy should be
maintained in view of a likely increase in perceptions of uncertainty over monetary
policy, the continuation of price rigidities in the service sector, the reduction of the
contribution of demand conditions to disinflation, and the continued high volatility in
costs of raw materials. Meanwhile, developments in international liquidity conditions
are being closely monitored.
In consideration of information currently available, policy rates are less likely
to increase, rather than remain stable or decrease in the medium-term. In the nearterm, however, the likelihood of policy rates remaining stable seems to have been
reduced somewhat since the last meeting. This policy perspective will ensure that
inflation is in line with the target path around mid-2007. On the other hand, it should
be emphasized that any new data and information associated with the inflation
outlook will compel the Monetary Policy Committee to potentially revise its stance
regarding the future.
