The Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) has been implement ing an inflation 
targeting regime since the beginning of 2006. This regime establishes a framework 
under which the CBT is accountable for achieving it s main goal of price stability, and 
for the policies implemented to pursue this goal. W ithin this framework, as stipulated 
by Article 42 of the Law, the accountability proces s is triggered when there is a 
significant deviation or potential deviation from t he established inflation targets. 
The inflation target for end-2009 was jointly set w ith the Government at 7.5 
percent. Consistent with the principle of accountab ility, the CBT policy statement 
issued on December 16, 2009 entitled “Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy in 
2009,” disclosed a quarterly path consistent with t he end-2009 target along with 
uncertainty bands. In this context, it was stated t hat the CBT, in the case inflation 
falls outside the band within that year, would explain through the Inflation Report the 
reasons for the breach, and the measures that would  be taken to ensure that 
inflation would revert to the pre-established targe ts. Should inflation fall outside the 
uncertainty band at the end of the year, the CBT wo uld write an open letter to the 
Government. 
The inflation outturn as of June 2009 was 5.27 perc ent, breaching the lower 
limit of the uncertainty band, which was set at 6.5  percent for mid-2009. Accordingly, 
attached, for your consideration, is the latest Inf lation Report issued on October 27, 
2009, which explains the reasons for the breach of the target, and the strategy 
adopted by the CBT to bring inflation back in line with the medium-term targets. 
 
Yours Sincerely,
