Press Release on Reserve Requirements  
20 June  2020, No: 2020 -34 
 
A revision is made to the reserve requirement regulation that links the reserve requirement ratios 
and remuneration  rates to loan growth rates.  
 
The CBRT continues to use reserve requirements flexibly and effectively as a macroprudential tool 
to support short- term interest rates –  its main monetary policy tool.   
 Circumstances of the coronavirus pandemic  had adverse impacts on cash flows, increasing  the 
loan demand of both individuals and firms . Measures put into effect ensured the efficient 
functioning of the credit mechanism and the increased loan demand was met to a considerable extent. This trend is expected to co ntinue for a while in the normalization process as well.  
 To provide banks with flexibility in meeting the loan demand specific to this period, the CBRT has decided to temporarily (until the year end) suspend the enforcement of the rule of having adjusted real loan growth rate  below 15%  for the banks with a real annual loan growth rate above 
15% in order to be able to benefit from reserve requirement incentives . 
 
The revision  will be effect ive from the calculation date  of 12 June 2020 with the maintenance 
period starting on 2 6 June  2020 to the calculation date  of 25 December 2020.
