PRESS RELEASE 
  
The interest rate on TL required reserves is decrea sed to 21 percent, by 
cutting 2 percentage points, to be effective from 1 9 September 2003. 
With the aim of contributing to the efficient and e ffective functioning of banks 
by alleviating their financial intermediation costs , TL required reserves and FX required 
reserves have begun to be remunerated starting from  8.8.2001 and from 24.5.2002 
respectively, in order to reduce the funding costs of required reserves maintained in 
the Central Bank without being remunerated. 
The interest rate applied to TL required reserves w as decreased recently to 23 
percent with a cut of 2 percentage points to be eff ective from 19.8.2003 and it was 
announced that the interest rate applied to TL requ ired reserves is held in the range 
between 75 to 80 percent of the simple weighted ave rage interest rate for Turkish lira 
denominated deposits and determined in line with th e changes in interest rates applied 
by banks on deposits. 
The interest rate applied to TL required reserves h as been set as 21 percent, 
with a cut of 2 percentage points, to be effective from 19 September 2003, by taking 
into consideration the declines in interest rates a pplied by banks for Turkish lira 
denominated deposits since 19.8.2003, influenced al so by the reduction in borrowing 
rates applied by CBRT. 
As before, the interest rate applicable to FX requi red reserves shall continue to 
be determined weekly, and shall be equivalent to th e interest rate on 2-days notice FX 
deposits that the banks hold as free deposits with the Central Bank.
