PRESS RELEASE

The interest rate on New Turkish Lira required reserves is decreased to 11.75
percent, by cutting 0,75 percentage points, to be effective from 7 February 2005.
With the aim of contributing to the efficient and effective functioning of banks by
alleviating their financial intermediation costs, New Turkish Lira required reserves and FX
required reserves have begun to be remunerated starting from 8.8.2001 and from 24.5.2002
respectively, in order to reduce the funding costs of required reserves that were being
maintained in the Central Bank without being remunerated.
The interest rate applied to New Turkish Lira required reserves was decreased recently
to 12,5 percent with a cut of 1,5 percentage points to be effective from 25.08.2004 and it was
announced that the interest rate applied to New Turkish Lira required reserves is held in the
range between 75 to 80 percent of the simple weighted average interest rate for New Turkish
Lira denominated deposits and is determined in line with the changes in interest rates applied
by banks on deposits.
The interest rate applied to New Turkish Lira required reserves has been set as 11.75
percent, with a cut of 0,75 percentage points, to be effective from 7 February 2005, by taking
into consideration the decline in interest rates applied by banks for New Turkish Lira
denominated deposits.
As before, the interest rate applicable to FX required reserves shall continue to be
determined weekly, and shall be equivalent to the interest rate on 2-days notice FX deposits
that the banks hold as free deposits with the Central Bank.
