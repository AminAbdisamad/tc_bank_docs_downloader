In line with its main objective of price stability, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey 
revised the reserve requirement regulation to improve the effectiveness of monetary

In the “ Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2021 ” text , it is stated  that reserve requirement  
ratios  will be used as a n instrument  to support the monetary stance and the monetary

Accordingly : 
- Turkish lira  reserve requirement ratios have been increased  by 200 basis points for  all 
liability typ es and  maturity brackets .

Turkish lira reserve requirements.

15% of Turkish lira r eserve requirements.  
As a result of these changes, TL -denominated required reserves are  expected to in crease by 
approximately TRY 25  billion, while  total required reserves  in FX and gold are expected to 
decrease by USD 0.5 billion , should the reserve option utilization rates remain  unchanged for the 
remaining tranches .
