PRESS RELEASE
ON
DECEMBER 2005 REALIZATIONS OF THE MONETARY PROGRAM
1. Under the 2005 monetary program, performance targets for the Base Money and
Net International Reserves, and indicative targets for Net Domestic Assets were set for the
end-December 2005 in accordance with the Letter of Intent dated 24 November 2005. The
specified targets have been met as of end-December. The details of the realized targets and
figures are given below:
a. The ceiling specified as performance criterion for the Base Money under the
monetary program was set at YTL 29,200 million for end-December, as calculated by the
average values of the last five working days. The average Base Money of the last five
working days of December stood at YTL 28,756 million, remaining below the upper limit of
YTL 29,200 million.
b. The floor specified as performance criterion for the Net International Reserves
under the monetary program was set at USD 14,000 million for end- December.
As of 30 December 2005, the realizations of Net International Reserves and its subitems are shown in the following table:

c. The indicative ceiling for Net Domestic Assets in the monetary program was
specified as YTL 25,500 million for end of December, as calculated by the average values of
the last five working days.

The realizations of Net Domestic Assets and its sub-items for the said period are

Therefore, the average Net Domestic Assets stood at YTL 12,587 million in the
mentioned period, remaining below the indicative ceiling value of YTL 25,500 million.

2. On the other hand, as stated in the press release of 5 December 2005, with the
adoption of the inflation-targeting regime at the beginning of 2006, Net International Reserves
will continue to be performance criteria, while the performance criteria for Money Base and
the indicative target for Net Domestic Assets have been replaced with the “inflation
consultation criteria” in the scope of “IMF program conditionality”. To this end, the
performance criteria and the indicative floors on the level of Net International Reserves
specified in the Letter of Intent dated 24 November 2005 are as follows:
a. USD 17,200 million for end-March 2006 (performance criterion)
b. USD 19,900 million for end-June 2006 (performance criterion)
c. USD 20,300 million for end-September 2006 (indicative target)
