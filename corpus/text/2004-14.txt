3. The six-month average of seasonally adjusted inflation became 0.54 percent in WPI and 0.48
percent in CPI. Annualized figures correspond to 6.7 percent and 5.9 percent, respectively. During the
same period, the average rate of increase in seasonally adjusted CPI excluding food realized as 0.83
percent. This figure corresponds to 10.4 percent in annual terms. (Figure 1).

Developments in Consumer Prices

4. Although price increases in CPI, both in food group and groups excluding food in general, pursued
a course consistent with the end-year target, relative rigidity in services persisted. Despite high
increases in agriculture group, price increases in food group realized as 1.5 percent in February. Prices
in this group merely increased by 0.4 percent in seasonally adjusted terms. İn summary, food prices
pursued a course that supported the downward trend in CPI inflation in the first two months of the
year.

5. Durable goods showed a slight increase compared to January. Especially prices of entertainment
and culture devices (this group mainly includes goods such as televisions and audio devices) dropped
by 5.8 percent and the two-month price decline reached 6.8 percent. This drop stemmed mainly from
the appreciation of Turkish İira.

6. Rent increases became one of the most remarkable developments in February. Also the rigidity in
rents is continuing as it is in the services group in general. The total increase, which has reached 3.6
percent in the first two months, is far from consistent with the end-year target.

7. Following January, price adjustments in health services continued by losing seme momentum in
February. Moreover, considering the first two- month rise, the increase of rate in prices slowed down
compared to 2003.

8. In February, the differentiation between prices of goods and services groups continued similar to
the previous months. Prices in rent, restaurant and health groups rose above the general CPI inflation.
Both low increase in food and durable goods and the decline in clothing group had a favorable effect
on price increases in goods group. Prices in services group have been displaying a regular and
significant increase above prices of goods group since mid-2003 (Figure 2).

Developments in Wholesale Prices

9. In February 2004, WP£xI increased by 1.6 percent. The rate of increase of seasonally adjusted WPI
rose by 0.4 point and became 1.1| percent. On the other hand, with 0.3 percent, WPI inflation
excluding agriculture maintained its downward course, which has been continuing since April 2003
(Figure 4).

10. In February, agricultural prices, which rose by 5.4 percent, contributed the most to the increase in
WPI. On the other hand, the seasonally adjusted rate of increase in agriculture prices declined by 2.9
percent compared to January and realized as 1.2 percent. İn other words, the price- push effect of
agricultural prices on WPI mainly resulted from fresh vegetable and fruit prices that increased due to
weather conditions as seen in January. However, as expected, this impact has weakened compared to
January.

11. Meanwhile, the increase in WPI excluding agriculture maintained its low trend of recent months.
WPI inflation excluding agriculture, which rose by 0.5 percent in January, realized as 0.3 percent in
February. Prices in private manufacturing industry and public manufacturing industry increased by 0.1
percent and 1.1 percent, respectively. Moreover, prices in electricity, gas and water groups declined by
0.9 percent.

12. In line with the developments mentioned above, annual WPI inflation and WPI inflation
excluding agriculture declined to 9.1 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively. High rates of increase in
these indices in the first months of 2003 owing to the developments in İragi War have played a role in
stimulating the drop in annual inflation figures as of February 2004.

I. OUTLOOK

13. Enhanced market confidence as a conseguence of the economic program has helped expectations
to improve, and the change in price-setting behavior and the TL appreciation have reduced the
ınflation even further by getting annual inflation closer to single digit figures. During this process, real
unit costs have decreased significantly thanks to the restructuring of the economic dynamics, and as a
conseguence, Turkey has witnessed a downward trend in inflation unprecedented in the last 30 years.
The inflation figures in the first two months of 2004 are pointing to a change in expectations and

pricing

behavior. Meanwhile, the rapid rise in agricultural prices is not expected to jeopardize the

inflation target and it is believed that due to the correction in agricultural prices negative inflation
figures might be observed in summer.

14. It is believed that the end-year inflation target for 2004 is within reach unless there arises an
exogenous shock. However, some important risks that might endanger attaining price stability still

prevail:

1) The rigidity in the price increases in services has not yet been completely broken and this
poses a risk to inflation for the coming period. Taking into account of the targeted inflation
rate instead of the past inflation rate, especially in house rent contracts, is crucially important
for breaking this rigidity. Certainly, such a pricing behavior can become widespread only if
positive expectations persist and there is no development that might put inflation at risk.
Within this framework, it should be underlined that the importance of managing expectations
appropriately and keeping domestic demand under control has become more critical than ever,
in order to cause the inflation in services to converge to the rate of price increase in goods
sector.

i1) İn February, possible ways of meeting the fiscal gap in the budget occupied a significant
part in the economic agenda. Within the scope of the supplementary budget prepared for this
purpose, public sector prices rose at the end of February due to adjustments made in Private
Consumption Tax (PCT). Although the extent of the additional funding remained unclear,
PCT adjustments have been carried out only in petroleum products and cigarettes until now.
The actual impact of these adjustments occurred at the end of the month will be seen on
March inflation. Despite this, the prices of pharmaceuticals were adjusted in line with the
exchange rates, and along with the reductions in Value Added Tax (VAT) and they will
compensate other negative impacts to some extend. The overall impact of finalized measures
on inflation is expected to be limited. However, considering that a significant contribution to
the recent downward trend in inflation has come from the modest rise in administered prices,
the course of those prices will become crucial in the next period as to whether it will be
different or not. Especially price increases in those products that affect input costs directİy
such as electricity, natural gas and petroleum are instrumental on inflation by means of costs
and expectations. Conseguentlİy, price adjustments that might occur in the said groups after a
probable deviation from fiscal discipline will continue to constitute a risk for inflation in the
medium-term.

il1) Considering that the rise in employment would pick up in the following period, the need
for maintaining the productivity increase backed by structural reforms will become crucial.
Accordingiy, good corporate governance, and structural arrangements intended to encourage
foreign direct capital investments will bear much significance.

iv) Exchange-rate volatility always creates a risk for inflation. Such a risk has started to
diminish relatively, due to the increasing confidence and the removal of concerns over the
sustainability of public debt. However, in order to be able to reduce this risk even further in
the course of time, the banking reform must be carried out, financial pressure must be eased,
expectations must be managed correctİy, and economic agents should increasingly rely upon
forward and future markets. By all means there will always be exchange rate risk in a floating
exchange rate regime. However, it will be useful to improve the free market system and
competitive environment in order to weaken exchange rate pass-through and minimize the
inflation risk originating from exchange rate.
v) In order to support the downward trend in inflation, it is important that the total domestic
demand should not exceed the potential production capacity of the economy. At this point, the
productivity increase in the public sector, the deepening of financial sector reform, the
encouragement of corporate restructuring, the acceleration of privatization and İiberalization
of markets, and the direct capital investment have come in the forefront. Attaining the
expected growth rates during the disinflation process can only be achieved by expanding the
output capacity of the economy, as well as supporting the productivity increase.

vi) In the first 5 months of 2003, inflation rates increased due to cost-push factors arising from
the Iragi War, as well as from the price hikes in food and agricultural products owing to
adverse weather conditions. With the removal of the said conditions, inflation rates maintained
a rather downward trend for the rest of the year. These developments created a significant
discrepancy in the inflation trend between the first and the second halves of the year. As a
natural conseguence of the mentioned effect, also called as the base effect, the downward
trend in annual inflation is expected to be significant in the first five months of 2004.
However, even though the downward course of inflation would continue during the remaining
part of the year, there may occur a standstill in the 12-month cumulative rates of inflation due
to base effect. Yet, such a development will be consistent with the inflation target. At this
point, it should be emphasized once more that the Central Bank will continue making its
monetary policy decisions by taking into account of the future course of inflation only, not the
past inflation. Therefore, the economic units should base their decisions on the expected trend
of inflation and the coherence of expected price increases with the targeted inflation, rather
than the annual inflation rates, which are backward-looking indicators.

15. To sum up, in order to preserve the success achieved in the fight against inflation in the last two
years, and to achieve and maintain price stability, it is reguired that: (1) the expectations are managed
properly and the current policies intended for ensuring macroeconomic stability are credible; (1i)
public deficits and total public debt stock are reduced, by sticking to the fiscal discipline; (iii) the
crowding-out effect due to the dominance of the public sector on the financial markets is decrease d to
ensure financial deepening in the framework of İowering public debt stock; (iv) the monetary
discipline should continue; (v) the price-setting behavior and incomes policy of the public and private
sectors are implemented in İine with the inflation targets; (vi) the rigidity in the already subdued
ınflation should be totally removed by putting into practice the structural reforms launched in legal
and institutional areas; (vii) the efficiency and guality in the production of goods and services should
be improved, by removing the obstacles to production and investment, and thereby raising the
competitive edge of the economy. As always, the Central Bank will continue monitoring the
applications in the above mentioned areas, and incorporate all possible developments in its monetary
policy decisions, adopting a forward-looking perspective.
