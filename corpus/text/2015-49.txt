Press Release on Foreign Exchange Auctions
Due to elevated volatility in global financial markets, the wording “up to USD 30
million above” stated in CBRT’s Press Release of 10 April 2015 is changed to “up to
USD 70 million above” starting from 19 August, 2015.
In this context,
The amount of foreign exchange selling auctions will be set on a daily basis
depending on the conditions in the foreign exchange market.
1) The minimum amount of the auction for the following day will be announced
by CBT at 17.20 through Anadolu Agency DV007, Reuters CBTQ and Bloomberg
CBT/ Foreign Exchange Auctions pages.
2) On days when deemed necessary due to excessive volatility, the FX selling
auction amount may be increased by up to USD 70 million above the
preannounced minimum amount. The auction amount will be announced as
usual at 16.30 local time on the same pages.
