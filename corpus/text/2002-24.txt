Press Release  
On 
“International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity” Table  
 
The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) has decided to publish the 
“International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity”  table on its Web site 
http://www.tcmb.gov.tr  under the heading of “Periodic Publications”, on a monthly  basis 
beginning with the February 2002 data. The “International Reserves and Foreign Currency 
Liquidity” table is prepared within the framework of Special Data Dissemination Standards – 
SDDS , which is conducted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in order to publicly 
disclose IMF member countries’ economic and financial statistics in a standardized form.  
The table is composed of mainly three sections covering information on “official reserve 
assets,”  “predetermined short -term net drains on foreign cur rency assets”  and “contingent 
short -term net drains on foreign currency assets.”  Official reserve  assets  in section I include 
foreign currency reserves (securities, currency and deposits), IMF reserve position, SDRs and 
gold. Securities and gold are valued  at market prices. Predetermined drains  under the section II 
covers principal and interest repayments to be made within one year and related to: i) foreign 
currency loans of the central government and the CBRT, ii) foreign currency -denominated 
government p apers issued by the Treasury, and iii) Foreign Exchange Deposit Accounts of 
Residents Abroad with the CBRT (named as Dresdner Deposits) maturing within one year 
(regardless of the original maturity) by maturity breakdown. Contingent drains  in section III 
covers principal and interest repayments of the public sector’s Treasury -guaranteed foreign 
currency debt to be made within one year  (by maturity breakdown), banks’ reserve requirements 
in foreign currency held with the CBRT, and Dresdner Deposits with rema ining maturity of 
longer than one year.  
Detailed methodological explanation on the Table is presented under “periodical 
publications.” Following months’ fıgures will be disseminated within the last week of each 
month in the same section.
