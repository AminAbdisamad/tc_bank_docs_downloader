PRESS RELEASE ON THE REVISED TITLE AND CONTENT OF THE WEEKLY
PRESS BULLETIN
In order to provide users with more thematic and comprehensive information,
the “Weekly Press Bulletin”, which used to be published on our web site via “Data /
Periodic Data / Weekly Press Bulletin”, will continue to be published every Thursday at
14:30 hours, yet it will have a revised content and the title “Weekly Money and
Banking Statistics”, as of 31 January 2013. The new publication, which is accessible
via “Data / Periodic Data / Weekly Money and Banking Statistics”, consists of 9 tables
compiled from the Central Bank and banking system balance sheets. This same link
also provides a comparison table for the two publications, which will serve to avoid
any data loss on the part of the users.
