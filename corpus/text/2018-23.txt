The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to increase the policy rate (one week 
repo auction rate ) from 16.5 percent  to 17.75 percent . 
Recently released data indicate a rebalancing trend in the economic activity . External demand maintain s 
its strength, while domestic demand displays a more moderate course . 
Cost factors ha ve been the main driver of the recent upsurge in inflation . On the other hand , price 
increases ha ve shown a generalized pattern across subsectors. Despite the mild outlook for demand 
conditions, elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations continue to pose risks on the pricing 
behavior.  Accordingly, the Committee decided to further strengthen the monetary tightening to support 
price stability . 
The Cen tral Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. 
Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until inflation outlook displays a significant 
improvement. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely 
monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.  
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.  
The summary of the  Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days.
