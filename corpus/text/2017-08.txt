As stipulated in the Article 42 of the Central Bank Law, in the case of a significant
breach of the inflation target, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (the Central Bank) is
accountable for reporting to the Government and announcing to the public the reasons behind
the breach of the target and the necessary measures to be taken. As stated in the main policy
document titled “Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy in 2016”, which was published on
December 9, 2015; the inflation target for 2016 was set jointly with the Government as 5
percent. In the same document, it was also indicated that the Central Bank would write an open
letter to the Government should end-year inflation exceed the target significantly (by more than
2 percentage points in either direction). Inflation reached 8.53 percent at end-2016, notably
exceeding the target. This text elaborates on the reasons why the target was missed and explains
the measures already taken—and to be taken—to bring inflation back to the target.
Factors Affecting Inflation in 2016
In the first Inflation Report of 2016 (IR 2016/I), the mid-point of the year-end inflation
forecast was given as 7.5 percent. However, deviations from the underlying assumptions and
developments affecting the dynamics of inflation through 2016 caused inflation to end the year
at a higher rate.
The main factors causing inflation to breach the target in 2016 include tax adjustments,
wage increases and the Turkish lira depreciation. The large minimum wage raise in early 2016
pushed the overall wage level higher, which affected consumer prices through both cost and
income channels, while SCT adjustments for tobacco, alcoholic beverages, fuel and
automobiles had a negative impact on inflation over the year. The fourth quarter’s plunging
Turkish lira and highly volatile exchange rates affected inflation not only through first-round
cost pressures but also through expectations channel and the overall pricing behavior.

Emerging market currencies have depreciated dramatically since mid-2013 amid
heightened uncertainty over global monetary policies. Both this ongoing outlook and
geopolitical developments of 2016 caused the Turkish lira to depreciate by about 11 percent
against the foreign currency basket in 2016. A large part of this depreciation occurred in the
final quarter, rendering the cumulative exchange rate pass-through less effective through the
year. In fact, the annual core goods inflation remained on a marked downtrend until November,
but started to climb by December due to the fourth-quarter TL plunge.
After dipping to an all-time low since 2004 in early 2016, oil prices had an increasing
trend throughout 2016 and are up by more than 40 percent year-on-year in December.
Additionally, the TL depreciation and the SCT hike on fuel led to a dramatic year-on-year
increase in annual energy inflation. Despite higher electricity prices of early 2016, the total
contribution from reduced natural gas prices and administered prices of energy was small.
Alcoholic beverages and tobacco made the fastest-growing contribution to inflation
through 2016. Besides SCT adjustments in January and December, July price hikes by tobacco
companies also stood out in this category. Thus, alcoholic beverages and tobacco pushed
annual inflation up by 1.6 points.
Services inflation remained elevated over the year as well. Despite the downward
pressure from the subdued economy, the tourism slump and the moderate food inflation,
services inflation remained high amid soaring real unit wages, the tumbling Turkish lira and
rising inflation expectations.
Meanwhile, food prices weighed on consumer inflation in 2016, contrary to previous
years. Along with favorable supply conditions of agricultural products, the measures put into
effect by the Food and Agricultural Products Markets Monitoring and Evaluation Committee,
the dismal tourism industry and the glut caused by Russian sanctions helped annual food
inflation to remain far below the historical averages.
In sum, despite weaker domestic demand conditions and moderate food prices, inflation
exceeded the target due to developments in exchange rates and import prices as well as
adjustments in minimum wages and taxes. The lagged effects of the Turkish lira depreciation in
the last few months, the course of oil prices and heightened medium-term inflation expectations
place an upward pressure on the inflation outlook. On the other hand, the modest economic
activity and the prediction that there will be no more upward adjustments on wage, tax and
administered prices are estimated to bring inflation down in 2017.

Measures Taken to Reach the Inflation Target
Throughout the year, the Central Bank has shaped its monetary policy framework by
taking into account inflation developments and expectations. Up until September, reduced
inflationary pressures, tight financial conditions and mild global conditions enabled the Bank to
gradually reduce the marginal funding rate. Accordingly, the marginal funding rate was
lowered by a total of 250 basis points during the March-September 2016 period. From October
onwards, however, the Bank has adopted a more cautious approach due to cost pressures
stemming from rising oil prices and exchange rate. In this regard, after keeping the policy rates
constant in October, the Bank raised both the weekly repo rate and the marginal funding rate in
November, in order to contain the adverse impact of exchange rate movements, caused by
heightened global uncertainty and volatility, on the inflation outlook. In addition, the Bank also
tightened the liquidity policy by increasing the share of marginal funding in the total Central
Bank funding. The same policy stance is maintained in December, in order to better assess the
impact of weakening in economic activity on inflation.
At the beginning of 2017, to avert the possible impacts of exchange rate volatility and
unhealthy price formations diverging from economic fundamentals, the Bank has launched a
policy framework which included dynamic and different liquidity instruments. Accordingly, the
CBRT did not launch one-week repo auctions starting from 12 January 2017 and the banks’
borrowing limits at the Interbank Money Market established within the CBRT were reduced.
On the days deemed necessary as of January 16, the amount of funding provided by the CBRT
through Borsa Istanbul repo markets was limited. Additionally, foreign exchange reserve
requirement ratios have been reduced by 50 basis points for all maturity brackets. Moreover, to
enhance flexibility and instrument diversity of the Turkish lira and FX liquidity management
within the current monetary and exchange rate policy framework, Foreign Exchange Deposits
against Turkish Lira Deposits market was opened on 17 January 2017.Excessive fluctuations in
exchange rates weighed on upside risks to the inflation outlook. Due to lagged effects of these
developments and the volatility in unprocessed food prices, the hikes in inflation are expected
to continue in the short term. Accordingly, the Bank decided to strengthen the monetary
tightening to contain the deterioration in inflation outlook. Thus, in January 2017, the marginal
funding rate was raised from 8.5 percent to 9.25 percent, and the CBRT’s borrowing rate under
the Late Liquidity Window Facility, was increased from 10 percent to 11 percent (Chart 1).

The initial effects of the monetary tightening have been extremely powerful. Owing to
the Central Bank policies, the depreciation trend in the Turkish lira has come to a halt and the
yield curve has flattened (Chart 2).
In addition to the interest rate and Turkish lira liquidity actions, the Central Bank also
took measures to support the foreign exchange liquidity; in response to the exchange rate
volatility realized in the second part of 2016. In this respect, the bank has provided extra
foreign exchange liquidity to the financial system, by gradually reducing the foreign exchange
reserve requirements and the reserve option coefficients. Furthermore, in order to enhance the
flexibility of the FX liquidity management of banks, the average amount of reserve
requirements that banks can hold in the maintenance period was raised to 4 percent from 3
percent. In addition, arrangements were made to extend the maturity of the export rediscount
credits and to make their repayment in Turkish liras until the end of the year. Measures such as
reimposing the cap on FX collateral deposits and partial provision of the FX liquidity needs of
energy importing public firms by the CBRT and the Treasury also supported the foreign
exchange liquidity in the market.
In sum, throughout 2016, in order to limit the adverse effects of volatilities in the global
and domestic financial markets, the Bank has maintained its stance that aims to balance foreign
exchange liquidity and support financial stability.
Given a tight policy stance that focuses on bringing inflation down, the 5-percent target
is expected to be achieved gradually; inflation is likely to stabilize around 5 percent as of 2019
after falling to 8 percent in 2017 and to 6 percent in 2018 (Chart 3). Assumptions on which the

Conclusion
The Central Bank will continue to employ all tools at its disposal to achieve the main
objective of price stability. Monetary policy decisions will be dependent on the inflation
outlook in the period ahead. By closely monitoring the inflation expectations, pricing behaviors
and developments in other factors affecting inflation additional monetary tightening may be
implemented if deemed necessary. Moreover, necessary measures will be taken against
unhealthy price formations in the foreign exchange market that are inconsistent with economic
fundamentals.
Although the monetary policy framework contribute to fighting against inflation,
experiences under the inflation targeting regime point to the need of a joint effort in
maintaining permanent price stability. In recent years, concurrent shocks and structural factors
kept inflation volatile and above the target. In achieving permanent price stability, it is
important to enhance cooperation and coordination among relevant institutions. Accordingly,
the Food and Agricultural Products Markets Monitoring and Evaluation Committee constitutes
a valuable example. The recently pronounced efforts to manage foreign exchange risk from a
financial stability perspective will support the effectiveness of the monetary policy and the fight
