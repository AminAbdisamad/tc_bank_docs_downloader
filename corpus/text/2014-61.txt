expected global monetary policy normalization in the coming months, the
Foreign Exchange Deposit Market interest rates that the banks pay if they wish
to borrow from the Central Bank within their limits through the Foreign
Exchange Deposit Market have been revised. The rates applied to banks' one
week maturity borrowings from the Central Bank as a last resort facility have
been reduced from 10 percent to 7,5 percent for USD and from 10 percent to
6,5 percent for EUR.
2- Banks have USD 10,8 billion transaction limits in the Foreign Exchange and
Banknotes Markets. Considering increase in the level of the banks’ balance

will be updated on the press meeting on “Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
for 2015” on December 10, 2014.
