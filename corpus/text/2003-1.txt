DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MONETARY PROGRAM IN 
OCTOBER-DECEMBER 2002 PERIOD 
  
 Base Money, Net Domestic Assets, and Net Internati onal Reserves, the main monetary 
aggregates on the Central Bank balance sheet, were specified as the indicative targets for the 
second half of 2002, in the publicly announced Janu ary 18, 2002 Letter of Intent. Of these 
aggregates, Base Money and Net International Reserv es have become performance criteria, 
while the indicative target for Net Domestic Assets  has been revised in the Letter of Intent, 
July 30, 2002. 
The targets specified for end-December within the f ramework of the monetary program 
have been  reached. The details of the  targets and  actual figures realized are given below: 
1- The ceiling specified as the performance criteri on for the Base Money, the nominal 
anchor in the monetary program, was targeted as TL 10.850 trillion for end-December,  
calculated  on  the average of the last 5 working d ays of the month. The average Base Money 
of the last five working days of December stayed at  TL 10.720 trillion, remaining below the 
TL 10.850 trillion ceiling. 
2- According to the monetary program, the credits o btained by the Treasury from the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2002, and the Treasury’s foreign currency denominated 
debt with a maturity less than one year are deducte d from the Central Bank’s  Net 
International Reserves in order to determine Net In ternational Reserves. The floor specified as 
performance criterion for Net International Reserve s for  end-December was USD (minus)      
- 9,700 million. 
 
 
 
 The realizations of the Net International Reserves and sub-items recorded on December

(minus) - 4.614 million, staying above the performa nce criterion floor of   USD (minus)          
-9.700 million. 
  
3- In the calculation method of Net Domestic Assets , the credits obtained by the Treasury 
from the IMF in 2002, and the TL equivalent of the Treasury’s foreign currency denominated 
debt with a maturity of less than one year are adde d to the Central Bank Net Domestic Assets. 
The indicative ceiling specified for end-December i s TL 33.139 trillion and is calculated by 
taking the average values of the last 5 working day s of December. The realizations of the Net 
Domestic Assets and sub-items for the said period a re shown in the following table: 
  
(Trillion TL)  
 Central Bank Net Domestic Assets                         (1)      7.504

                                                                     (3)      2.508 
Net Domestic Assets under the IMF program    (4=1+2 +3)     28.603 
  
Thus, in the said period, the average Net Domestic Assets stayed at  TL 28.603 
trillion, remaining below the indicative ceiling va lue of TL 33.139 trillion.
