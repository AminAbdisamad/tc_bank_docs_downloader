PRESS RELEASE

DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MONETARY PROGRAM IN
OCTOBER-DECEMBER 2002 PERIOD

Base Money, Net Domestic Assets, and Net International Reserves, the main monetary
aggregates on the Central Bank balance sheet, were specified as the indicative targets for the
second half of 2002, in the publicly announced January 18, 2002 Letter of Intent. Of these
aggregates, Base Money and Net International Reserves have become performance criteria,
while the indicative target for Net Domestic Assets has been revised in the Letter of Intent,
July 30, 2002.
The targets specified for end-December within the framework of the monetary program
have been reached. The details of the targets and actual figures realized are given below:
1- The ceiling specified as the performance criterion for the Base Money, the nominal
anchor in the monetary program, was targeted as TL 10.850 trillion for end-December,
calculated on the average of the last 5 working days of the month. The average Base Money
of the last five working days of December stayed at TL 10.720 trillion, remaining below the
TL 10.850 trillion ceiling.
2- According to the monetary program, the credits obtained by the Treasury from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2002, and the Treasury’s foreign currency denominated
debt with a maturity less than one year are deducted from the Central Bank’s

Net

International Reserves in order to determine Net International Reserves. The floor specified as
performance criterion for Net International Reserves for end-December was USD (minus)
- 9,700 million.

The realizations of the Net International Reserves and sub-items recorded on December
31, 2002 are shown in the below table:

Thus, the Net International Reserves specified in the program has been realized as USD
(minus) - 4.614 million, staying above the performance criterion floor of USD (minus)
-9.700 million.

3- In the calculation method of Net Domestic Assets, the credits obtained by the Treasury
from the IMF in 2002, and the TL equivalent of the Treasury’s foreign currency denominated
debt with a maturity of less than one year are added to the Central Bank Net Domestic Assets.
The indicative ceiling specified for end-December is TL 33.139 trillion and is calculated by
taking the average values of the last 5 working days of December. The realizations of the Net
Domestic Assets and sub-items for the said period are shown in the following table:
