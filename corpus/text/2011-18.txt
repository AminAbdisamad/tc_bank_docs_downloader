THE CBRT PRESS RELEASE     
ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE BUYING AUCTIONS 
 
The Central Bank of Turkey holds foreign exchange b uying auctions to 
increase the level of foreign exchange reserves wit hout conflicting with the main 
principles and the mechanism of the floating foreig n exchange rate regime at times 
when foreign exchange supply increases relative to foreign exchange demand. In this 
framework, as it is stated in the press release of 21 December 2010 on “Monetary 
and Exchange Rate Policy for 2011”, the CBRT has co ntinued accumulating foreign 
exchange reserves by purchasing USD 50 million dail y, starting from 1 January 2011. 
As stated in the said press release, although the a im is to hold auctions in line with 
the pre-announced program, in case of unforeseen cr ucial developments pertaining 
to foreign exchange supply, amendments to auction p rograms can be made with prior 
notice. Thus, taking into account the slowdown in c apital flows, the daily amount to 
be purchased in auctions was decreased from USD 50 million to USD 40 million, 
starting from 31 May 2011.  
It is stated in the May 2011 Financial Stability Re port that, in case the capital 
flows to developing countries continue to weaken, t he daily amount to be purchased 
via foreign exchange buying auctions may continue t o be gradually decreased, 
leading to a decline in the Turkish lira liquidity supplied to the market from this 
channel, which in turn would decrease the need for additional increases in the 
required reserve ratios in the second half of 2011 in terms of credit growth.  
Recently, mounting concerns about the sustainabilit y of the government debt 
of some European countries and global growth contin ue to adversely affect the risk 
appetite, which in turn lead to a slow down in capi tal flows towards developing 
countries, including Turkey. Taking this into consi deration, the daily amount to be 
purchased in auctions was decreased from USD 40 mil lion to USD 30 million within 
the framework of the flexible foreign exchange buyi ng auction method announced in 
the press release of 1 October 2010, starting from today.   Our program related to foreign exchange buying auct ions may again be 
evaluated in line with the liquidity developments i n the foreign exchange market.  
Accordingly, daily auction amounts may be changed i n either direction with prior 
notice, while auctions may also be suspended for a short or long period of time if 
needed.
