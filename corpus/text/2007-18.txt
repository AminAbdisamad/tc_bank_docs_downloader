SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 12 July 2007
Inflation Developments
1.

Consumer prices fell by 0.24% in June, bringing 12-month cumulative inflation
down by 0.63 percentage points to 8.60%. Accordingly, annual inflation registered
a total decline of 2.26 percentage points in the past 3 months and stayed within
the uncertainty band.

2.

Unprocessed food prices remain volatile. Last month’s Summary of the
Monetary Policy Committee Meeting mentioned the possibility of more limited
price declines of unprocessed food this summer due to early harvest of some
vegetable items. Indeed, the decline in vegetable prices in June was less than
last year’s levels and thus the annual inflation of unprocessed food prices
increased, notwithstanding the partial correction in fruit prices. Volatility in fruit
and vegetable prices continue to pose risks to the course of headline inflation.
Moreover, bad crop of wheat may have adverse effects on consumer prices
through bread and grain products.

3.

The rise in oil prices had adverse effects on inflation via fuel prices in the past
couple of months. Utility prices and non-oil energy items however, continued to
display a benign course.

4.

Durable goods (excl. gold) inflation fell to 0.32%, per annum, in response to
both the strong Turkish lira and the easing demand. On the other hand, the
annual inflation in clothing and footwear prices rose to 7.15%.

5.

Although the services inflation ceased to decline in June, developments in
sub-items suggest a continued downward trend: The main driver of services
inflation in June was the rise in mobile phone call rates. The delayed effects of
rising oil prices on transportation services also somewhat restrained the decline in
services inflation. On the other hand, monthly inflation in other services items
remained below last year’s levels. In fact, the cumulative rise in service prices
was only 4.61% in the first half of the year, the lowest 6-month figure since the
2003-based CPI index was introduced. Annual services inflation is expected to
further decline in the forthcoming period.

6.

Special CPI aggregates also respond to last year’s monetary tightening. The
favorable course of services and durable goods prices in the last three months
significantly curbed the inflation in special CPI aggregates. Inflation is expected to

come further down in the next couple of months, on the back of the lagged effects
of monetary tightening and the high base of the second half of 2006.

Factors Affecting Inflation
7.

The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) assesses that the recent
data on economic activity is broadly consistent with the outlook presented in the
April Inflation Report.

8.

Although the GDP grew by 6.8% in annual terms during the first quarter of
2007, seasonally adjusted growth was only 0.4%, indicating an ongoing slowdown
in economic activity.

9.

Contribution of domestic demand to GDP growth was limited during the first
quarter of 2007. Seasonally adjusted data suggest that private consumption and
private investment expenditures displayed a moderate increase over the previous
quarter, while construction investment continued to grow steadily.

10. Consumption spending continued to moderate in the second quarter. The
pace of growth in total consumer loans was low during the second quarter
compared to the first half of 2006, although personal expenditure loans gained
momentum in this period. While automobile loans continued to decrease in the
second quarter, other leading indicators on domestic demand such as domestic
sales of white goods and imports of consumer goods declined slightly on
seasonally adjusted terms during April-May period. Taking into account the
significant base effect driven by the strong demand of the last year, the annual
growth in private consumption demand is expected to turn to negative in the
second quarter.
11. Indicators of investment demand point to a modest recovery. While imports of
capital goods displayed a recovery during April-May, the decline in commercial
vehicle sales continued to restrain machinery and equipment investment.
Construction investment, on the other hand, keep growing, albeit at a moderate
pace compared to the previous two years.
12. In the first quarter, annual real growth rate in total government spending was
9.1%, moderating the slowdown in aggregate demand. Primary spending
increased by 29.3% in nominal terms, per annum, during the April-May period,
indicating that government spending continued to rise at a high pace in the
second quarter. This observation is also supported by the January-June figures of
the Treasury's primary cash balance.
13. External demand continues to support the economic activity. Industrial
production was strong in May with the stimulus of exports. Leading indicators

suggest that export growth remained robust also in June and July. Strong external
demand and ongoing productivity gains should support the export growth in the
forthcoming period. However, considering the strong second-half figures of last
year, the annual rate of growth in exports is expected to moderate in the
upcoming period.
14. The marked decline in inflation had a favorable impact on inflation
expectations. Improvement in the expectations should continue in the upcoming
period as the inflation keeps declining. However, the Committee reads the
existing gap between medium-term inflation expectations and targets as a factor
requiring caution.
15. In sum, while the developments in energy and food prices, public
expenditures, and external demand since the last quarter of 2006 restrain the
disinflation process, domestic demand and inflation continue to decelerate thanks
to the lagged effects of strong monetary tightening.
Monetary Policy and Risks
16. Recent developments are broadly in line with the April Inflation Report.
Therefore, adhering to the outlook presented in the Report, the Committee
envisions a measured easing starting from the last quarter of 2007. However, the
exact timing and extent of the easing may vary depending on the incoming
information regarding external demand, public expenditures and other
determinants of medium term inflation outlook.
17. It should be stressed that this policy stance is based on the current information
set and thus it should by no means be interpreted as a commitment on behalf of
the Committee. The Committee highlighted the following uncertainties that could
necessitate a significant revision in the monetary policy outlook in either direction:
18. Inflation expectations remain sticky, partly owing to the elevated headline
inflation figures of the past year. Uncertainties regarding the food and oil prices
and the incomes policy in 2007 further add to the stickiness in inflation
expectations. The present gap between medium term expectations and targets
suggests that the target inflation may have been serving less of an anchor
recently. This constitutes a risk for wage setting behavior, and hence, for services
inflation. Realization of such a risk would slowdown the pace of disinflation,
possibly requiring a tighter-than-envisaged monetary policy.
19. There are certain services items, of which, inflation inertia is driven by
structural factors and thus, cannot simply be explained by backward indexation.
Needless to say, these prices can hardly be influenced by monetary policy. For
example, annual rent inflation have remained sticky around 20 percent in the past
three years, contributing to annual headline inflation by about one percentage

points each year. Rent inflation is expected to moderate in the next couple of
months, and further stabilize in the medium to long term, as the housing supply
keeps rising. Nevertheless, the possibility that rent inflation will continue to
exceed the other services inflation is considered as a risk factor against the
disinflation process.
20. The monetary transmission mechanism has proven to be effective during the
past year. Despite the increase in non-interest government spending and the
robust external demand that have restrained the speed of disinflation, monetary
tightening has been successful to bring inflation back to the projected path
heading towards the medium term targets. However, in order to reach the
medium term target of 4 percent, the domestic demand needs to stay under
control for a while. However, domestic demand conditions may turn less
supportive for the disinflation process, once the prevailing uncertainties fade out
and the long-term interest rates continue to decline during the second half of the
year. Such a situation could lead monetary policy to stay more cautious than
implied by the baseline scenario. Nonetheless, such an outcome would be less
likely, should the cautious monetary policy stance backed by fiscal discipline.
21. Possible fluctuations in the global liquidity conditions continue to pose risks to
the inflation outlook. The inflation and growth outlook for the developed
economies are still not clear, and thus, international financial markets continue to
be sensitive to new data releases. Ongoing uncertainties over the global
imbalances stand out as another risk factor that might lead to abrupt changes in
portfolio preferences and liquidity conditions. The Central Bank of Turkey will limit
the potential inflationary effects of a possible shift in risk perceptions by pursuing
an active liquidity management strategy.
22. In this respect, the Committee, considering the current levels of liquidity,
assessed that the Central Bank Liquidity Bills could be used, in addition to the
current tools used in open market operations, to enhance the effectiveness of
liquidity management when necessary.
23. Prudent monetary policy is necessary but not sufficient for achieving price
stability. The role of fiscal policy and structural reforms are also critical in this
process. In this respect, the European Union accession process and the
implementation of the structural reforms envisaged in the economic program
remain to be important for long-term stability. Particularly, advances in structural
reforms that would enhance the quality of fiscal discipline are monitored closely
with regard to their effects on both macroeconomic and price stability.
