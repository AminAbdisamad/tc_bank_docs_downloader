SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 23 February 2016
Inflation Developments
1. In January, consumer prices edged up by 1.82 percent, and annual inflation rose by
0.77 points to 9.58 percent. This rise in inflation is attributed to the products with
administered prices and unprocessed food prices. The total effect of adjustments in
certain products with administered prices in early January amounted to 0.7 points,
as projected. Core goods inflation continued to rise, and services inflation
maintained its high level. Accordingly, annual inflation of core indicators recorded
an increase, while their underlying trend improved slightly.
2. Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 0.82 points to 11.69
percent. This was mainly driven by unprocessed food prices that increased due to
the prices of fresh fruits and vegetables. Annual inflation reached 20.09 percent in
this sub-group, while that in unprocessed food hit 15.33 percent. On the processed
food front, annual inflation increased to 8.41 percent amid the price developments
in bread-cereals group in the last two months. Leading indicators for February
suggest a downtrend in food inflation.
3. On the energy front, prices rose by 0.81 percent due to electricity prices, and annual
inflation climbed to 4.61 percent. Annual energy inflation is envisaged to fall due to
developments in oil prices coupled with the base effect in February.
4. Prices of services increased by 1.34 percent, and annual services inflation increased
to 9.16 percent in January. Prices of services recorded the fastest monthly increase
of the last ten years, and high increases spread across sub-groups. The gradually
slowing price increases in the restaurants-hotels group amid the moderate course of
meat prices in the last quarter of 2015 re-accelerated in January. In addition to wage
developments and the high course of food inflation, accumulated exchange-rate
pass through effects delay the fall in services inflation.

5. Annual core goods inflation edged down by 0.12 points to 10.10 percent in January.
Annual inflation decreased in durable goods, but maintained its uptrend in other
sub-groups. Effects of the exchange rate continued with a dwindling pace in prices
of core goods excluding clothing and durable goods, while the decline in clothing
prices remained below seasonal averages. On the other hand, seasonally-adjusted
indicators suggest an improvement in the underlying trend of core goods inflation in
January.
6. In sum, energy prices continue to affect inflation favorably, while other cost factors
limit the improvement in the core inflation trend.
Factors Affecting Inflation
7. Industrial production recorded an increase in December compared to previous
month. Quarterly production in the fourth quarter materialized above the third
quarter. The headline PMI and the PMI production indices fell in January, despite
staying above neutral levels. Business Tendency Survey data suggest that domestic
orders registered an increase from the previous quarter’s average, while export
orders were relatively weaker. Given these indicators as well as data on exports and
imports, the pace of industrial production growth is expected to decelerate
somewhat in January.
8. Data on the expenditure side suggest a milder course of private demand growth in
the final quarter of 2015 relative to the third quarter. In this period, the production
and imports of consumer goods were down from the previous quarter’s average.
Among indicators of investment, the production of capital goods posted a modest
fourth-quarter growth, whereas the imports receded. The production of nonmetallic minerals and sales of heavy commercial vehicles, which are indicators for
construction investments, registered an increase. Among indicators for the first
quarter of 2016, auto sales remained subdued in January, while home appliance
sales were up. Consumer confidence indices declined in January and February yet
remained above the October level. Meanwhile, data on the investment tendency
hint at a moderate growth. Against this background, private demand is expected to
rise modestly in the first quarter of 2016.
9. Favorable developments in the terms of trade accompanied by the moderate course
of consumer loans support the recovery in the current account balance. Despite
heightened geopolitical risks, the growing EU demand continues to support exports.
The recovery in Europe, one of Turkey’s major export markets, continued into
January. Additionally, Turkey’s high market-shifting flexibility also supports exports.
Thus, amid a continued EU demand growth, low commodity prices and ongoing
macroprudential policies, the current account balance is likely to improve further in
2016, which, however, might be restrained by the likely fall in tourism revenues due
to geopolitical developments.

10. Unemployment rates were down month-on-month in November 2015. In this
period, employment grew at a faster pace than labor force in nonfarm sectors.
Across sub-sectors, the services provided the largest contribution to nonfarm
employment growth. Industrial employment decreased marginally, whereas
construction employment picked up. Industrial production and survey indicators
signal no additional rebound for industrial employment over the upcoming period.
The course of nonmetallic mineral production indicates a moderate growth in
construction employment. Employment data for sub-sectors of services remain
volatile. Leading indicators for the labor market suggest that unemployment rates
will remain flat over the coming months.
11. In conclusion, recent indicators suggest that the economy continues to grow at a
moderate pace. In the upcoming period, domestic demand is likely to be supported
by the income channel through wage increases and low oil prices. Although
geopolitical tensions pose a downside risk, demand from the European Union
economies continues to support exports at an increasing pace.
Monetary Policy and Risks
12. Although energy price developments continue to affect inflation favorably, other
cost factors limit the improvement in the core inflation trend. Meanwhile, food
prices remain volatile largely due to unprocessed food prices. Leading indicators
point to a likely downward correction in unprocessed food prices in the short term.
Moreover, the waning of the lagged pass-through effects of cumulative exchange
rate movements might contribute to disinflation in coming months. Against this
backdrop, the Committee expects the disinflation to resume by February. Yet,
developments in both wages and inflation expectations pose an upside risk to the
core inflation outlook. Thus, core inflation indicators are likely to remain elevated
for some time. The adverse impact of the above-target inflation on inflation
expectations and the acceleration in wage increases necessitates a close monitoring
of the overall pricing behavior. Therefore, the current tight monetary stance should
be maintained in order for the impending disinflation to be permanent. Against this
backdrop, considering the impact of wage developments and the uncertainties in
global markets on inflation expectations and the pricing behavior, and taking into
account the volatility in energy and unprocessed food prices, the Committee stated
that the tight liquidity stance will be maintained as long as deemed necessary.
Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking
into account inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and the course of other
factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained.
13. Annual loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary
policy stance and macroprudential measures. Recent data point to no major change
in the underlying trend of loans. Adjustments in risk weights and minimum wages
are considered to support loan growth through the loan supply and household
income channels. Yet, the ongoing financial tightening is likely to keep annual loan

3

growth rates at reasonable levels. With respect to the composition of loans,
commercial loans continue to grow faster than consumer loans. Such a composition
not only limits medium-term inflationary pressures but also supports the
improvement in the current account balance.
14. Leading data indicate that domestic demand has slowed somewhat as of mid-2015
but continues to contribute to growth modestly. The financial tightening due to
persisting global volatility dampens domestic demand growth, whereas energy
prices and wage developments bolster domestic demand through the income
channel. On the foreign demand front, geopolitical developments pose a downside
risk, yet the European economic recovery and the market-shifting flexibility of
Turkish exports offset this risk. In fact, the favorable effect of the growing EU
demand on exports has become more significant recently. Moreover, improvements
in the terms of trade mainly led by the cumulative fall in commodity prices, coupled
with the modest course of consumer loans, support the improvement in the current
account balance. Overall, economic activity is expected to remain on a moderate
growth path while the current account deficit is expected to narrow further in the
upcoming period.
15. The Committee assesses that the effective use of the policy tools announced in the
road map of August 2015 strengthen the resilience of the economy against global
shocks. This process is supported by a gradual reduction in demand for foreign
exchange due to improved current account balance and lower energy prices.
Meanwhile, foreign currency liquidity instruments are used to stabilize the value of
the Turkish lira. In this context, foreign currency liquidity is provided through flexible
foreign exchange sales auctions at amounts deemed necessary.
16. Nevertheless, uncertainties surrounding global monetary policies and concerns over
global growth cause global markets to remain volatile. Emerging-market portfolio
inflows and risk premiums follow a fluctuating pattern, while exchange rate
volatilities remain elevated. In the forthcoming period, both global and domestic
volatilities will be monitored closely and required measures in foreign exchange and
Turkish lira markets will continue to be taken. In the case of sustained volatility,
additional measures might be taken to support the Turkish lira by adjusting the
funding conditions for the use of foreign currency denominated collateral, while
maintaining the tight monetary policy stance.
17. In this respect, the Committee stated that the policy stance will remain tight against
the inflation outlook, stabilizing for the FX liquidity and supportive of the financial
stability.
18. The Committee stated that the wide interest rate corridor has contributed markedly
to containing exchange rate volatility in times of heightened global volatility. The
need for such an instrument would be reduced, should the decline in global volatility
prove persistent. Another factor that may reduce the need for a wide interest rate

4

corridor is the effective use of the policy instruments laid out in the road map
published in August. Excessive fluctuations in both exchange rates and loans have
waned owing to the launch and effective use of these instruments. The Committee
still maintains the view that the monetary policy may be implemented within a
narrower and more standard interest rate corridor, should global volatilities post a
permanent decline or the policy tools of the August road map permanently contain
the effects of the global volatility on the Turkish economy.
19. Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with
regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance
is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and
there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices. A revision of the
monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate
significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the
medium-term inflation outlook.
20. Sustained fiscal discipline has become a fundamental element in reducing the
sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years. In the
current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the value added from
maintaining and further advancing these achievements is significant. Any measure
that would ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings
deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social
welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels.
