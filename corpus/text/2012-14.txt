Meeting Date: March 27, 2012
Participating Committee Members
Erdem Başçı (Governor), Ahmet Faruk Aysan, Turalay Kenç, Necati Şahin, Abdullah
Yavaş, Mehmet Yörükoğlu
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short
term interest rates constant at the following levels:
a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) at 5.75 percent,
b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 5 percent, lending rate at 11.5
percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via
repo transactions at 11 percent,
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.):
Borrowing rate at 0 percent, lending rate at 14.5 percent.
Recent data confirm that the rebalancing between the domestic and external
demand continues as envisaged. While consumption demand shows a significant
slowdown in the first quarter, leading indicators suggest a modest recovery for the
second quarter. Exports continue to grow at a steady pace. Accordingly, despite the
elevated oil prices, the improvement in the current account balance is expected to
continue in the forthcoming period.
Inflation developments are in line with the path projected in the January Inflation
Report. Yet, the Central Bank has implemented a new round of additional monetary
tightening in order to eliminate the impact of recent cost developments on inflation
expectations. Factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored in the forthcoming
period and additional monetary tightening will be repeated, when necessary.
Taking the liquidity projections into account, the ranges for weekly and monthly
Turkish lira funding have been revised. In addition, certain revisions regarding the
fraction of required reserves that can be held in gold have been approved.
Given the prevailing uncertainties regarding the global economy, it would be
appropriate to preserve the flexibility of the monetary policy. Therefore, the impact of the
measures undertaken on credit, domestic demand, and inflation expectations will be
monitored closely and the funding amount will be adjusted in either direction, as
needed.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the
Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within
five working days.
