Dear Press Members, 
 
I have been appointed Governor of the Central Bank, which was vacated by Former Gov ernor 
Mr. Süreyya Serdengeçti due to his retirement after having com pleted his five-year term on 
14 March 2006 at the end of the business hours, and which has been filled tempora rily by Dr. 
Erdem Ba şçı as Acting Governor since then. 
 
I have worked in various positions of the Central Bank of the Republic of  Turkey since 1980. 
As you have been closely following, many achievements have been ma de since then, 
especially in the last couple of years, that will always be remembered as the turning points in 
our economic history. 
 
Distinguished members of the press, 
 
As a result of the legal amendments made in 2001, the greatest a chievement in the area of 
monetary policy has been the attainment of the “Central Bank Independenc e”. Accordingly; 
 
“The Bank shall, with the objective to achieve and maintain price stability, be authorized to 
utilize monetary policy instruments described in this Law and shall  also be authorized to 
directly determine and implement other monetary policy instruments that it deems 
appropriate.” as expressed in the Law on the Central Bank. 
 
Such an authorization is called “instrument independence” in the modern economic lit erature. 
 
On the way to price stability, the inflation target is determ ined jointly with the government.  
As you know, these targets have been determined and announced as follows:  
 
5 percent for 2006, 
4 percent for 2007, 
4 percent for 2008 
 
Our primary objective is to attain these targets. The Central Ba nk will support the growth and 
employment policies of the Government, unless it conflicts with thi s objective. 
 
Likewise, with the Law No: 1211, the Central Bank has been entrusted with the power of 
establishing the “exchange rate regime” jointly with the governm ent. The floating exchange 
rate regime, which was introduced within this framework, will c ontinue to be implemented, 
preserving its basic implementation framework. 
 
Turkey has grasped a golden opportunity to get rid of the damage creat ed by inflation with 
which it has had to live more than 30 years. The period of “Declining  inflation” is about to 
end. Our next objective will be to achieve and preserve the price stability. This will be the 
most significant contribution of the Central Bank in mobilizing the gr owth potential of our 
country.   
 
Thank you.
