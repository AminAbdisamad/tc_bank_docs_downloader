THE CBRT PRESS RELEASE
ON
THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE BUYING AUCTIONS

The Central Bank of Turkey holds foreign exchange buying auctions to
increase the level of foreign exchange reserves without conflicting with the main
principles and the mechanism of the floating foreign exchange rate regime at times
when foreign exchange supply increases relative to foreign exchange demand. In this
framework, as it is stated in the press release of 21 December 2010 on “Monetary
and Exchange Rate Policy for 2011”, the CBRT has continued accumulating foreign
exchange reserves this year by purchasing USD 50 million daily. As stated in the said
press release, although the aim is to hold auctions in line with the pre-announced
program, in case of unforeseen crucial developments pertaining to foreign exchange
supply, amendments to auction programs can be made with prior notice.
In fact, although there is no significant change in the liquidity conditions of the
developed countries that play an important role in the robustness of the capital flows,
concerns related to the sustainability of the increasing government debt of some
European countries adversely affect the risk appetite which in turn cause a relative
slow down in capital flows towards emerging countries, including Turkey. Taking into
consideration the slowdown in the capital flows, the daily amount to be purchased in
auctions was decreased from USD 50 million to USD 40 million, starting from
tomorrow within the framework of the flexible foreign exchange buying auction
method announced in the press release of 1 October 2010.
Our program related to foreign exchange buying auctions may again be
evaluated in line with the liquidity developments in the foreign exchange market.
Accordingly, daily auction amounts may be changed in either direction with prior
notice, while auctions may also be suspended for a short or long period of time.
