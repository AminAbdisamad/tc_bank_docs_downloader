THE CBRT PRESS RELEASE 
ON 
THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE BUYING AUCTIONS 
 
The Central Bank of Turkey holds foreign exchange b uying auctions to 
increase the level of foreign exchange reserves wit hout conflicting with the main 
principles and the mechanism of the floating foreig n exchange rate regime at times 
when foreign exchange supply increases relative to foreign exchange demand. In this 
framework, as it is stated in the press release of 21 December 2010 on “Monetary 
and Exchange Rate Policy for 2011”, the CBRT has co ntinued accumulating foreign 
exchange reserves this year by purchasing USD 50 mi llion daily. As stated in the said 
press release, although the aim is to hold auctions  in line with the pre-announced 
program, in case of unforeseen crucial developments  pertaining to foreign exchange 
supply, amendments to auction programs can be made with prior notice. 
In fact, although there is no significant change in  the liquidity conditions of the 
developed countries that play an important role in the robustness of the capital flows, 
concerns related to the sustainability of the incre asing government debt of some 
European countries adversely affect the risk appeti te which in turn cause a relative 
slow down in capital flows towards emerging countri es, including Turkey. Taking into 
consideration the slowdown in the capital flows, th e daily amount to be purchased in 
auctions was decreased from USD 50 million to USD 4 0 million, starting from 
tomorrow within the framework of the flexible forei gn exchange buying auction 
method announced in the press release of 1 October 2010.   
Our program related to foreign exchange buying auct ions may again be 
evaluated in line with the liquidity developments i n the foreign exchange market.  
Accordingly, daily auction amounts may be changed i n either direction with prior 
notice, while auctions may also be suspended for a short or long period of time.
