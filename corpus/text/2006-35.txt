PRESS RELEASE
ON
THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE SALE AND NEW TURKISH LIRA DEPOSIT
PURCHASE AUCTIONS HELD BY THE CENTRAL BANK OF THE REPUBLIC OF
TURKEY

The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) has decided to implement a
strong monetary tightening and the Monetary Policy Committee increased the policy rates on
June 26, 2006. Parallel to the increase in policy rates, The CBRT has also decided to sterilize
the excess liquidity in the money markets to enhance the effectiveness of the decision on
monetary tightening. .
The Monetary Policy Committee has stated that proper functioning of the foreign
exchange market is an important prerequisite to achieve the target on price stability. So the
Committee has expressed its support for effective intervention in the market to provide
foreign exchange liquidity via its available instruments.
Parallel to turmoil in the international financial markets, the financial markets of
Turkey have experienced excessive fluctuations in the foreign exchange markets in the recent
period. It is observed that the decline in the foreign exchange liquidity both triggers the
excessive fluctuations and also encourages speculative behaviors in the market.
Following the assessments of Monetary Policy Committee, the CBRT has decided to
hold “Foreign Exchange Sale Auction” and “ New Turkish Lira Deposit Purchase Auction”
effective as of June 26, 2006 within the framework of the following principles.

A)

FOREIGN EXCHANGE SALE AUCTIONS

Adhering to the principles of the floating exchange rate regime, the CBRT will be
more vigilant against excessive fluctuations incoherent with the economic fundamentals and
that undermine the stability in the financial markets and triggered by the exogenous factors,

uncertainties and speculative behaviors. Accordingly, the CBRT will provide foreign
exchange liquidity to the market via auctions, in case where the foreign exchange markets
experience a decline in liquidity and/or poor price formations. In case where foreign exchange
sale auctions fail to meet the need for liquidity in foreign exchange markets the CBRT will
not hesitate to intervene in the markets via direct foreign exchange sales. The markets and the
public will be informed about the amounts of foreign exchange sales at 10.00 a.m. before
auctions are held. The daily maximum amount set for the auction held on June 26, 2006 is
USD 500 million.

Banknotes Markets may attend the auction.
