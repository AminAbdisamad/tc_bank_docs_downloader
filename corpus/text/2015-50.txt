SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 18 August 2015
Inflation Developments
1. In July, consumer prices increased by 0.09 percent while annual inflation was down
0.39 points to 6.81 percent. Annual food inflation was flat month-on-month
whereas falling oil prices brought annual energy inflation down. Services inflation
declined while core goods inflation rose slightly due to exchange rate pass-through.
The underlying trend of core inflation displayed a slight improvement.
2. Annual inflation in food and nonalcoholic beverages remained flat at 9.25 percent in
July. Annual inflation was slightly up in unprocessed food but continued to slow in
processed food. On the unprocessed food front, prices of fresh fruits and vegetables
remained favorable, whereas meat prices continued to rise. Among processed food
items, prices of bread and cereals continued to affect inflation favorably whereas
prices of other items slightly accelerated.
3. Annual energy inflation decreased to 1.58 percent amid falling fuel prices driven by
lower oil prices. With the ongoing plunge in oil prices in July, annual energy inflation
is expected to slow further in August.
4. Prices of services were up 0.80 percent in July while annual services inflation
dropped by 0.43 points to 8.42 percent. Amid higher meat prices, prices of catering
services continued to soar in July. Annual inflation increased in rents and
restaurants-hotels but fell in communication and transport items due to base
effects. Overall, the underlying trend of services inflation posted a month-on-month
improvement.
5. Annual core goods inflation increased by 0.09 points to 6.05 percent in July. Annual
inflation was up in durable goods, down in clothing and flat in core goods excluding
clothing and durables. Prices of durable goods reflected the pass-through effect
from exchange rate movements. Thanks to the favorable course in clothing prices,
the underlying trend of core goods inflation registered a fall.

Factors Affecting Inflation
6. The industrial production index increased strongly by 2.4 percent month-on-month
in June. Accordingly, industrial production grew by 1.6 percent quarter-on-quarter
and 3.9 percent year-on-year in the second quarter of 2015. The strong production
growth in June does not signify an acceleration in economic activity and is rather a
result of compensating for the output loss led by the May strikes in the auto
industry and expediting production before Ramadan. In fact, leading indicators for
July and August suggest that the industrial production might moderate in the second
half of the year.
7. Data on the expenditure side indicate that private consumption demand expanded
further in the second quarter while investments remained weak. Production and
imports of consumption goods were higher in the second quarter compared to their
averages in the previous quarter. Meanwhile, production and imports of capital
goods excluding vehicles fell in the second quarter. Indicators for the construction
industry do not hint at a recovery for construction activity. After declining
dramatically in May amid strikes, domestic sales of automobiles registered monthon-month gains in June and July. Thus, having contributed substantially to
consumption lately, sales of automobiles are believed to have supported
consumption further in July. On the other hand, the PMI for the July-August period
and the Business Tendency Survey order indicators for July do not signal a solid
domestic demand. Likewise, consumer confidence indices remained weak in July.
Firmsâ€™ expectations for future investments increased slightly in July but remained
sluggish. In sum, current indicators point to a moderate outlook for consumption
demand yet signal no recovery for investments.
8. After the first-quarter decline, the non-gold quantity index, an indicator for external
demand, posted a quarter-on-quarter increase in the second quarter. Non-gold
imports, on the other hand, grew modestly in the second quarter. As a
consequence, deterioration in the real rebalancing process since mid-2014
somewhat reversed in the second quarter of 2015. Amid lower energy prices, the
current account balance is expected to improve further in the upcoming period.
However, the relatively weak outlook of exports and the likely fall in tourism
revenues may dampen this improvement.
9. In May, seasonally adjusted total and nonfarm unemployment rates climbed by 0.2
and 0.3 points month-on-month, respectively. Although employment continued to
expand in nonfarm sectors, unemployment increased due to the rising labor force
participation, which was flat for some time. Industrial and services employment
grew in this period, whereas construction employment declined. Industrial
employment expanded at a stronger pace than in previous periods, providing the
biggest contribution to nonfarm employment growth. Industrial production and
survey indicators suggest that the industrial sector will contribute mildly to

employment in the forthcoming period. The support from services was more limited
due to the sluggish tourism industry. The contribution from the services industry to
employment is expected to remain below early 2015 levels in the upcoming period.
Thus, prospects for a robust employment growth are slim for the remainder of the
year. The economic outlook and the waning investment tendency pose a downside
risk to the labor market.
10. To sum up, in the second quarter, external demand remained weak while domestic
demand contributed to growth moderately. Current indicators suggest a similar
outlook for the July-August period. Yet, uncertainties in global markets and the weak
course of consumer and investor confidence add to the downside risks to growth for
the upcoming period.
Monetary Policy and Risks
11. Loan growth continues to expand at a reasonable pace in response to the tight
monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. Commercial loan growth
remains robust while consumer loans continues to decelerate. Recent tightening in
financial conditions is likely to have some slowing impact on loan growth in the
upcoming period. Overall, the pace and the composition of loans limit medium-term
inflationary pressures and contribute to the improvement in the current account
balance.
12. Recent data releases signal no significant change in the macroeconomic outlook.
The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of
consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance.
External demand remains weak, while domestic demand contributes to growth
moderately. Although the recovery in the European economy affects the external
demand positively, ongoing geopolitical developments and the slowdown in global
trade restrict the export growth. Domestic demand, on the other hand, exhibits a
modest upward trend driven mainly by consumption.
13. Although available data point to an ongoing moderate growth for economic activity,
recent developments necessitate close monitoring of forward-looking signals.
Recently, rising risk premiums due to global and domestic uncertainty have led to a
tightening in financial conditions. This, coupled with the already weak confidence
indices, creates downside risks regarding the domestic demand for the second half
of the year.
14. Committee members stated that the inflation outlook has not displayed the
desirable improvement yet. Although processed food and energy price
developments affect inflation favorably in the short run, the cumulative exchange
rate movements since early 2015 delay the recovery in the core inflation trend.
Against this backdrop, the Committee stated that a slightly tighter monetary policy
stance might be necessary to counterbalance the upside risks to inflation.

15. The Committee indicated that the inflation outlook and the risks would be
instrumental for the exact implementation of the monetary tightening. Due to the
imminent economic slowdown, exchange rate pass-through to domestic prices will
be more limited than implied by historical estimations. Moreover, falling commodity
prices partly offset the exchange rate effect. Meanwhile, downside risks to global
economy and domestic economic activity remain significant. Accordingly, the
Committee agreed to adopt a flexible approach for the implementation of the
monetary tightening at this point and follow the consequences closely to review the
situation at the next meeting. In conclusion, given the uncertainty over domestic
and global markets and the volatility in energy and food prices, the Committee
decided to implement a tighter liquidity policy for as long as deemed necessary.
16. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the improvements in the
inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that
affect inflation will be monitored closely and the cautious monetary policy stance
will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant
improvement in the inflation outlook.
17. The Committee also evaluated the strategy to be pursued before and after the
global monetary policy normalization, and decided to implement policy measures in
three dimensions: (i) interest rate and Turkish lira liquidity, (ii) FX liquidity, and (iii)
policies regarding financial stability. It was concluded that, considering the current
global and domestic circumstances, the policies need to be tight for the Turkish lira,
stabilizing for the FX liquidity, and supportive for financial stability. The Committee
decided to publish the related document on the website.
18. A significant of the meeting focused on the simplification of the monetary policy
framework. The Committee suggested that monetary policy framework may be
simplified by gradually narrowing the interest rate corridor during global monetary
policy normalization. It was stated that, eventually one week repo rate will assume
the role of policy rate and represent the stance of monetary policy.
19. The Committee underlined that structural measures to support financial stability are
as important as the cyclical policies to stabilize capital flows. Accordingly, the
published roadmap included measures to support the FX liquidity and to provide
incentives for core liabilities and long-term borrowing. The Committee stated that
the past measures on this front have already enhanced the resilience of the
economy and that additional measures may further bolster these gains.
20. Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with
regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance
is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and
there will be no unanticipated hikes on administered prices. A revision of the
monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate
significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the
medium-term inflation outlook.

21. Sustained fiscal discipline has become a fundamental element in reducing the
sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years. In the
current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the value added from
maintaining and further advancing these achievements is significant. Any measure
that would ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings
deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social
welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels.
