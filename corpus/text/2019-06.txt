As stipulated in Article 42 of the Central Bank Law No. 1211, if the inflation target is not 
attained , the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) is accountable for reporting to the 
Government and announcing to the public the reasons for the deviation from the inflation target and 
the necessary measures to be taken. As stated in the main policy doc ument “Monetary and Exchange 
Rate Policy for 2018”, which was published on 5 December 2017, the inflation target for 2018 was 
set jointly with the Government at 5%. In the same document, it was also indicated  that the CBRT 
would write an open letter to the  Government should the year -end inflation deviate from the target 
range (by more than two percentage points from the target in either direction). The year -end inflation 
stood above the target range in 2018. This document elaborates on  the reasons for the d eviation of  
inflation from the target and explains the measures already taken -and to be taken - to bring inflation 
back to the target.  
Factors Affecting Inflation in 2018  
The depreciation of the Turkish lira and th e resulting deterioration in  pricing be havior 
constituted the main factors causing inflation to overshoot the target in 2018. Strong demand 
conditions in the first half of the year also added to the upward trend in inflation .  
The impact of the increase in Turkish lira -denominated import prices  was evident particularly  
in core goods and energy groups. The core goods group, which is characterized by high and relatively 
rapid exchange rate pass -through, was among the main drivers of the rise in inflation.

On the other hand, tax cuts in durable goo ds and the sliding -scale tariff system  in fuel  curbed the 
inflation in core goods and energy. Meanwhile, administered energy prices posted  increases 
throughout the year. In the recent period, the partial  appreciation  in the Turkish lira and the 
deceleration in international oil prices had a downward effect on  core goods and energy inflation.  
Another major contribution to the rise in inflation came from food prices. Food inflation ended 
2018 at 25.11%, a level above the g eneral consumer inflation, due to cost pressures, adverse supply 
conditions for some products and the brisk course of tourism. Inflation in tobacco products, on the 
other hand, remained considerably below consumer price increases in the same period.    
In 2018, annual inflation in the services group rose due to the depreciation of the Turkish lira, 
backward indexation, stronger cost pressures in sectors related to food and energy,  and demand -side 
effects driven by the robust course in tourism, and became 14. 46% at the end of the year. Meanwhile, 
price hikes in this group slowed owing to the weakening economic activity in the last quarter.    
In sum, the depreciation in the Turkish lira and the deterioration in pricing behavior drove 
inflation above the target in 2018. Economic activity that was relatively strong in the first half of the 
year started to weaken in the third quarter and demand conditions pu lled inflation down in the last 
quarter in particular. Partial  appreciation  in the Turkish lira, the decline in oil prices and favorable 
effects of tax cuts on a number of durable consumption goods were the other factors that contributed 
to the fall in inflation in the last quarter of the year.  
Measures Taken to Reach the Inflation Target  
The CBRT delivered a strong monetary tightening in 2018 to suppo rt price stability in the face 
of deterioration in pricing behavior and risks to inflation outlook (Chart 1). Additionally, the CBRT 
completed the simplification process regarding  the operational framework of the monetary policy, 
thereby improving the predictability of its monetary policy to a significant extent.  
Tight monetary policy stance was maintained during the January –March 2018 period, 
followed by a measured monetary tig htening in April to s upport price stability. In May, the CBRT 
strengthened its tight stance in monetary policy taking into account the risks to general pricing

Meanwhile, along with the reserve options mechanism (ROM), other instruments were used 
to support  the FX liquidity. In addition,  repayments of rediscount credits for export and FX earning 
services were allowed to be made in Turkish liras, provided that they were paid at maturity. These 
measures regarding foreign exchange and Turkish lira  liquidity man agement as well as  the monetary 
tightening and the decision to finaliz e the simplification process in May  helped mitigate the volatility 
in financial markets.  
In June, the simplification process regarding the operational framework of the monetary 
policy was completed. Accordingly, the policy rate of the CBRT became the one -week repo rate. 
Moreover, it was decided that the CBRT’s overnight borrowing and lending r ates would be 
determined at 150 basis points below/above the one -week repo rate. In the new operational 
framework, the CBRT started to provide entire  funding via week ly repo auctions (Chart 2). As a 
result , the monetary transmission mechanism was substanti ally strengthened.  6810121416182022242601.17

In early August, to avoid excessive volatility in financial markets and to ensure  efficient 
operation of markets , the CBRT introduced a series of financial stability -oriented measures that 
supported Turkish lira and foreign exchange  liquidity management. The upper limit for the FX 
maintenance facility within the ROM was lowered, liquidity injections were made through reduced 
Turkish lira and FX reserve requirement ratios, banks’ collateral conditions were made more flexible, 
and weekly repo auctions were temporarily  suspended . In this period  of elevated financial market 
volatility, cost -side pressures and the deteriorat ion in pricing behavior affected the inflation outlook 
adversely. In this regard, the CBRT  implemented a strong monetary  tightening in September to 
support price stability in which the one -week repo rate was raised to 24 %. In view of  ongoing risks 
to price stability, the Bank retained its tight monetary policy stance in the following period.  
In 2018, considering  the increased exchange rate volatility and unhealthy pric e formations, 
the CBRT widened its  set of tools  to ensure efficient  functioning of the markets and to support the 
transmission mechanism. Accordingly, Turkish lira-Settled Forward Foreign Exchange t ransactions 
were launched at the Derivatives Market (VIOP) operating under Borsa İstanbul (BIST). 
Additionally, the Turkish Lira Currency Swap Market was opened. The  aim of the se steps was to 
contribute to the deepening of the Turkish derivatives  market an d to the foreign exchange risk 
management  of the corporate sector.  
Monetary measures coupled wi th coordinated steps in economic  policies lowered the market 
volatility considerably. In the last quarter of the year, pricing behavior started to normalize , and the 
inflation outlook improved gradual ly. Nevertheless, the tight monetary stance is preserved due to the 
persistent ly high levels in inflation and risks to price stability.  
Under  a tight monetary policy stance and enhanced policy coordination focuse d on bringing 
inflation down, inflation is projected to converge gradually to the target s. Accordingly, inflation is 
projected to be 14.6% at the end of 2019 and then fall to 8.2% at the end of 2020 and  to 5.4% at the 
end of 2021, before stabilizing around 5 % in the medium -term. Thus, with a 70% probability,

inflation is expected to be between 11.9% and 17.3% (with a mid -point of 14.6%) at end -2019 and 
between 5.1% and 11.3% (with a mid -point of 8.2%) at end -2020 (Chart  3).

Maintained coordination in macro policies and the  rebalancing process in the economy are 
expected  to contribute to the improvement in the country’s risk premium, and contain the  volatility  
in financial markets . Against this background, the gradually improving pricing behavior accompanied 
by waning cumulative cost effects will be the drivers of the fall  in inflation. Moreover, demand 
conditions are also expected to contribute further to the disinflation process. On the other hand, 
breaking  the backward -indexation  behavior is critical for success in  the fight against inflation.

Conc lusion  
Inflation increased significantly following  the exchange rate movements in 2018. In addition 
to the monetary policy  actions , the implementation of an economy program focusing on rebalancing 
helped contain the deterioration in inflation expectations and pri cing behavior. However, the current 
level of inflation and global uncertainties keep risks to price stability in place and call for a cautious 
policy stance.  
In the upcoming period, the CBRT will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of 
the price stability objective. Monetary policy stance will be geared towards maintaining a sustained 
disinflation process by bringing inflation down to a single digit figure at the initial stage, and to 5 
percent target afterwards.  The CBRT will closely monit or inflation expectations, pricing behavior 
and developments in other factors affecting inflation and deliver further monetary tightening, if 
needed.  
The recent coordinated macro  policy  steps have underpinned  the improvement in risk 
perceptions and help ed bring inflation back on downtrend. Maintaining a tight monetary policy stance 
and strong policy coordination are crucial for reducing  inflation  inertia , limiting risks to pricing 
behavior and achieving the inflation target. Against this backdrop, it is envisaged that risk perceptions 
will continue to improve, and the confidence channel and the credit channel will gradually support 
economic recovery.  
The CBRT will continue to support studies on structural issues to achiev e lasting price 
stability. Contin ued implementation of reforms  towards alleviating inertia and volatility in inflation 
will provide significant contribution to price stability and social welfare. In this context , the CBRT 
will maintain  its efforts to contribute to the analysis of  structural factors and to the design of 
macroprudential polic ies.
