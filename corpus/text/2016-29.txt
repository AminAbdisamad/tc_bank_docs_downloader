Communication Practices of the Central Bank of the Republic of
Turkey
The Central Bank of Republic of Turkey has revised its communication policy and the
following arrangements have been introduced:
• Meetings on technical issues will be held with investors and analysts.
• Regular meetings will be organized with investors in financial centers abroad.
• Meetings will be held with chambers of industry and commerce and other
corporate sector representatives to provide a platform for an exchange of views.
• Periodic meetings will be organized with representatives of media institutions
and the financial press.
• The monthly meetings with bank economists will now be held when deemed
necessary, as the need for these meetings will be reduced with these new
arrangements.
Briefings on Inflation Reports and other communication practices will continue
unchanged.
The principles of implementation will be shared separately with the relevant parties.
