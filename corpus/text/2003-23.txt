PRESS RELEASE 
ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE INTERVENTION   
OF THE CENTRAL BANK 
  
The Central Bank has announced through several pres s releases that, under 
the floating exchange rate regime, the level of exc hange rate is determined by supply 
and demand conditions in the markets, but still the  volatility in the exchange rate has 
been closely observed, and that the Central Bank ma y directly intervene in the 
markets in the event of an excessive volatility in both directions. In this context, the 
Central Bank directly intervened in the foreign exc hange market on 12 th  of May by 
buying foreign currency, due to the excessive volat ility in exchange rates. As a matter 
of fact, volatility in exchange rates reduced last week after the intervention.  
However, due to excessive volatility, the Central B ank directly intervened once 
again in the foreign exchange market today. This ex cessive downward volatility 
observed yesterday and today stemmed from foreign e xchange sales due to heavy 
tax payments and delayed foreign exchange demand of  economic agents related to 
their business activities rather than economic fund amentals such as balance of 
payments or reverse currency substitution.
