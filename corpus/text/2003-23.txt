PRESS RELEASE
ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE INTERVENTION
OF THE CENTRAL BANK

The Central Bank has announced through several press releases that, under
the floating exchange rate regime, the level of exchange rate is determined by supply
and demand conditions in the markets, but still the volatility in the exchange rate has
been closely observed, and that the Central Bank may directly intervene in the
markets in the event of an excessive volatility in both directions. In this context, the
Central Bank directly intervened in the foreign exchange market on 12th of May by
buying foreign currency, due to the excessive volatility in exchange rates. As a matter
of fact, volatility in exchange rates reduced last week after the intervention.
However, due to excessive volatility, the Central Bank directly intervened once
again in the foreign exchange market today. This excessive downward volatility
observed yesterday and today stemmed from foreign exchange sales due to heavy
tax payments and delayed foreign exchange demand of economic agents related to
their business activities rather than economic fundamentals such as balance of
payments or reverse currency substitution.
