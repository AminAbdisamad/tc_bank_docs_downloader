The Monetary Policy Committee has decided  to  increase  short-term interest 
rates (policy rates)  at the CBRT Interbank Money Market and the Istanbul Stock 
Exchange Repo-Reverse Repo Market as follows:  
a) Overnight Interest Rates:  The CBRT borrowing interest rate is increased to  
15 percent from 13.25  percent, and the CBRT lending interest rate is increased to 18 
percent from 16.25  percent.  
b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates:  Within the framework of the Late 
Liquidity Window Facility, the CBRT overnight borrowing interest rat e applicable 
between 4:00 p.m. – 4:30 p.m. at Interbank Money Market is increased to 11 percent  
from 9.25  percent. Lending interest rate is increased to 21 percent  from 19.25 
percent.  
c) The interest rates applicable to overnight and one-week maturity  borrowing 
facilities provided for primary dealer banks via repo transactions w ithin the 
framework of open market transactions are increased to 17 percent  from 15.25 
percent. 
 According to the April and May inflation figures, the annual inflation rate 
significantly exceeded the target path. Moreover, annual inflation fi gures to be 
recorded in the next months might further go up temporarily, with the pa ss-through 
effect of the exchange rate movements arising from the recent volatility in financial 
markets. The Monetary Policy Committee has deemed it necessary  to revise the 
policy rates in order not to let such temporary developments cause per manent effects 
on the medium-term expectations and pricing behaviors, and also to make s ure that 
the medium-term inflation trend is kept in line with the targets.  
In light of currently available information, the policy rates are less likely to 
rise in the short-term, compared to the previous period. However, it should be 
reminded that the direction of monetary policy decisions might change conditional on 
developments pertaining to inflation outlook. Policy decisions will be base d on a 
perspective in which inflation would converge to the target towards the  end of 2007. 
Therefore, accompanied by the envisioned decline in inflation, the directi on of policy 
rates would be downward as well in the medium-term. It should be emphasized that any new data or information associated wi th the 
inflation outlook will potentially lead the Monetary Policy Committe e to revise its 
future stance.  
A broader summary of the assessments of the Monetary Policy Comm ittee 
will be published within five working days.
