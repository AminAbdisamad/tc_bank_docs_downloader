RESERVE REQUIREMENTS COVERAGE 
 
Non-bank financial institutions have been monitored  for financial stability 
purposes and it has previously been announced that a regulation could be introduced 
to extend the coverage of reserve requirements, if deemed necessary.  
Taking into account the rapid increase in loans ext ended by financing 
companies, to prevent unfair competition and to ens ure a sound monitoring of the 
credit channels of the non-bank sector as required by financial stability, financing 
companies have also been included in the reserve re quirements coverage.   
Accordingly, financing companies will hold required  reserves for their liabilities, 
at the accounts to be opened with the CBRT, under t he current ratios applied to the 
banks. As suggested by June 2013 data, the Turkish lira and foreign exchange 
liabilities of financing companies subject to reser ve requirements are TL 7.1 billion and 
TL 3 billion, respectively, which are expected to g enerate required reserves of 
approximately TL 900 million. The regulation will b e effective as of the calculation 
period dated 6 December 2013 and the maintenance pe riod will begin on 20 
December 2013.  No: 2013 â€“ 53  Release Date: 4 October 2013
