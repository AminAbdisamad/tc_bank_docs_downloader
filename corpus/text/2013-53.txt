PRESS RELEASE ON THE INCLUSION OF FINANCING COMPANIES IN THE
RESERVE REQUIREMENTS COVERAGE

Non-bank financial institutions have been monitored for financial stability
purposes and it has previously been announced that a regulation could be introduced
to extend the coverage of reserve requirements, if deemed necessary.
Taking into account the rapid increase in loans extended by financing
companies, to prevent unfair competition and to ensure a sound monitoring of the
credit channels of the non-bank sector as required by financial stability, financing
companies have also been included in the reserve requirements coverage.
Accordingly, financing companies will hold required reserves for their liabilities,
at the accounts to be opened with the CBRT, under the current ratios applied to the
banks. As suggested by June 2013 data, the Turkish lira and foreign exchange
liabilities of financing companies subject to reserve requirements are TL 7.1 billion and
TL 3 billion, respectively, which are expected to generate required reserves of
approximately TL 900 million. The regulation will be effective as of the calculation
period dated 6 December 2013 and the maintenance period will begin on 20
December 2013.
