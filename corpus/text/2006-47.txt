Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) adopted a formal inflati on-targeting framework at 
the beginning of 2006. Accordingly, the end-year infl ation target for 2006 was set as 
5 percent, defined as the annual change in Consumer Pri ce Index (CPI). To facilitate 
the accountability principle, the CBT has disclosed a quar terly path of inflation for 
2006 consistent with the end-year target with an uncert ainty band of 2 percentage 
points on both sides. In adherence with the Article 42 o f the Central Bank law, the 
CBT committed to provide the Government with a writt en statement explaining the 
reasons for inflation exceeding the upper limit of the  uncertainty band and the 
measures to be taken to ensure that inflation rate will  return to levels within pre-
established limits. 
Annual CPI inflation in September 2006 was 10.55, br eaching the upper limit of 
the uncertainty band announced for end-September 2006  at 7.8 percent (Figure 1). 
This open letter explains the reasons why inflation exce eded the predetermined 
target path by a large margin, evaluates the measures taken by the Central Bank of 
Turkey to bring inflation back to the target, and fina lly presents the medium term 
outlook and the horizon in which inflation converges to  the medium term target. As 
mentioned in our policy statement titled “General Fra mework of Inflation Targeting 
and Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2006” publi shed on December 5, 2005, 
this Open Letter will also be presented to the IMF as p art of the program 
conditionality.

The Reasons For Exceeding The Target 
Before starting to present the developments in the last  quarter, it would be 
useful to recall that in the Open Letter and the Infl ation Report published in July 
2006, breaching the upper limit of the uncertainty ba nd was attributed to a 
combination of several supply shocks such as rising oil prices, increases in the 
tobacco product prices, high unprocessed food price inflatio n, the continued 
increases in the gold prices, and the portfolio shock origi nated from the change in 
global liquidity conditions. Although, the relatively  strong course of the domestic 
demand might have been one of the factors affecting in flation, a careful analysis of 
the price data and capacity indicators suggested that the role of the supply factors in 
breaching the target, by and large, was dominant. The  short-term inflation outlook 
has improved since the publication of the July Open Lett er. Although the expected 
correction in unprocessed food prices has not been observed in the third quarter, the 
oil and other commodity prices followed a more favorab le course than our baseline 
assumptions. This development was particularly important to contain the second 
round effects of the high oil prices. The rebound of th e New Turkish Lira has also 
contributed to the short-term inflation outlook. 
The accumulated impact of previous shocks has kept the annual  inflation at 
high levels. The negative course of unprocessed food price s and the lagged impact 
of the exchange rate pass-through drove annual inflati on up to 10.55 percent in 
September—a figure just about in line with our project ions which stood between 10 
and 11 percent for end-September inflation in the Jul y Inflation Report.  
A close look at the 9-month cumulative price increases in ce rtain subgroups of 
CPI unveils the main factors behind the rise in inflati on in 2006 (Figure 2). It is clear 
from the figure that one of the main reasons for the rise in inflation was the 
substantial increase in the unprocessed food prices. The fig ure also reveals the role 
of energy prices as an adverse factor in the first 9 mont hs of 2006 inflation. Rising 
inflation in prices of goods excluding energy and unpro cessed food can be 
explained by the exchange rate pass-through. The service s inflation, on the other 
hand, exhibited a gradually declining pattern in the  past three years.

The research conducted by the CBT staff suggests that the p ass-through from 
exchange rate to consumer prices is close to 20 percent in a  5-month period. Given 
that the depreciation in the New Turkish Lira has been around 15 percent since 
April, our calculation of the cumulative pass-through im pact on annual inflation is 
close to 3 percentage points in the May-September perio d. In other words, it can be 
claimed as a rough cut that annual inflation could have  been around 7.5 percent in 
the absence of the sell-off in May-June period. 
The first round effect of the exchange rate pass-through  is almost complete. 
The pass-through is expected to be visible through clothi ng and apparel prices in 
October, yet remain at low levels thereafter. According ly, we estimate the cumulative 
impact of exchange rates on headline inflation to reach  3.5 percentage points until 
the end of the year. Assuming that the second round eff ects are limited, the base 
effect should drive annual inflation downwards starting  from the second quarter of 
2007.   
Annual change in the most widely cited core CPI (excludi ng energy, 
unprocessed food, tobacco-alcohol and gold), denoted by H , also continued to 
increase during the last quarter due to lagged effects o f the exchange rate pass-
through, reaching 8.7 percent at the end of September . However, it should be 
emphasized that this is an expected outcome since a big fr action of the H index is 
durable goods, which is highly sensitive to exchange rate  developments. 
Accordingly, the fact that inflation measured by H inde x has been rising in the last 
couple of months should not be interpreted as news to th e monetary policy. 
Although the first round effects of the exchange rate p ass through is largely 
complete, we expect core  inflation figures to stay at high levels due to past 
cumulative effects until the second quarter of 2007.                                                                                                               Central Bank of Turkey

Measures Taken to Ensure the Convergence of Inflati on to the Targets  
In the July Open Letter, we already mentioned that t he volatility in the 
exchange rates, coupled with the other cost-push factors such  as the strong 
commodity prices and rising food prices, has led to a serio us deterioration in inflation 
expectations in May and June. Central Bank of Turkey imp lemented a two-pillar 
package as a reaction to the volatility in the financial  markets and the consequent 
rise in inflation expectations. The first pillar of the  policy response was a rate hike of 
400 percentage points in June, which sent the markets a cle ar signal of the Central 
Bank’s commitment to the medium-term inflation targets.  It was also a manifestation 
of the end of the “fiscal dominance”. 
The second pillar of the package was to withdraw the exce ss domestic 
currency liquidity in the financial markets via deposit p urchase auctions and FX 
sales, while raising the lending rate up by a total of  6 percentage points. By doing 
so, the CBT aimed to reduce  the potential volatility in the markets by designing a  
flexible mechanism to deal with sudden shifts in the mar ket sentiment. The plan 
worked well and the financial markets calmed down. Market s reacted favorably to all 
these decisive policy measures and the long-end of the yi eld curve shifted down. 
In the following meeting held on July 20th, the Mone tary Policy Committee 
(MPC) raised the policy rates by a further 25 basis poin ts and stated that a 
measured tightening might be necessary to meet 2007 end -year target. By giving 
such a signal, the CBT aimed at containing the second rou nd effects of the 
exchange rate pass-through and eliminating the mismatch between inflation 
expectations and the medium-term targets. 
The medium-term inflation outlook has been affected by  many factors since the 
July letter. On the positive side, new data suggested th at the risks of high inflation in 
industrial countries have been easing. The Federal Reser ve’s decision, at their 
meeting on 8th of August to keep Federal funds rate on  hold, has further mitigated 
the impact of the May-June sell-off on the domestic marke ts. This development has 
also reduced the risk premium, which further tightened t he monetary conditions. 
Another positive development was the decline in commodi ty prices.  On the other 
hand, domestic demand conditions have not slowed as much a s expected, reflecting 
sooner-than-expected recovery of the confidence and part ly the increase in 
government spending. Given these counteracting factors, t he uncertainties over the 
transmission mechanism and over the impact of the large Ju ne-July interest rate 
hikes, the MPC did not change the policy rates in August and September meetings 
(Table 1). 
 The September wage award to civil servants is also likely  to add to inflationary 
pressures, particularly in services. Accordingly, while keepi ng rates on hold in the 
October meeting, MPC stressed the need to maintain a ti ght policy stance in the 
face of continued global imbalances, high inflation exp ectations, and the increased 
risks related to services inflation.                                                                                                            Central Bank of Turkey

The decisive policy measures taken by the CBT and the dem onstration of its 
firm commitment to the medium term targets helped to contain the inflation 
expectations. The deterioration in medium-term expecta tions stopped in July. Both 
the 12-month and the 24-month ahead inflation expect ations exhibited a declining 
pattern in the past 2 months (Figure 3). However, the  improvement in medium term 
expectations was limited, possibly owing to the adaptive  behavior coupled with the 
elevated headline inflation figures. We expect that i nflation expectations will come 
down gradually as inflation decelerates in the medium term. The fact that currently 
24-month ahead inflation expectations are significantly  higher than our medium term 
target of 4 percent, however, necessitates a tight policy  stance.

Outlook For Inflation and Monetary Policy 
The Background and Current Conditions  
We assess that monetary policy has been tightened significa ntly. Implied real 
policy rate is 11 percent – a reasonably high figure ev en if it is corrected with various 
kinds of country risk premium measures. The longer-term in terest rates such as the 
interest rates on government securities and consumer loans suggest even tighter 
monetary conditions. Other indicators, such as the slowdown  in credit expansion 
and the monetary indicators confirm this view. Therefor e, although there are 
uncertainties over the impact of the policy rates on econ omic activity, it is 
reasonable to assume that current financial conditions and  monetary policy stance in 
Turkey are non-accommodative.  
The tight monetary policy stance is expected to contain t he inflationary 
pressures starting from the first quarter of 2007. The p ost-2001 data suggests that 
the impact of the real interest on the economic activity  is mostly visible in 1 to 3 
quarters in the Turkish economy. Indeed, there are some signs of a slowdown in the 
domestic demand, although not as pronounced as expected i n July: The rapid credit 
expansion has been easing since June; the quarter on quar ter consumer credit 
growth exhibited a significant deceleration in the thi rd quarter of 2006 (Table 2). 
Automobile and housing sales registered a sharp decline i n the last couple of 
months. Consumer confidence index dropped in June and Jul y before it rebounded 
modestly. In the meanwhile, annual growth in monetar y indicators displayed a 
noticeable decline. In sum, recent indicators suggest a consi derable slowdown in the 
private domestic demand, especially on interest rate sensitive secto rs such as car 
sales, durable goods and housing. It remains unclear, how ever, whether aggregate  
domestic demand will slowdown at the same pace, especially  given the noticeable 
public spending and wage increases, and the prevailing u ncertainties regarding the 
impact of real interest rates on demand conditions.

Although our projections suggest an increase in the contri bution of net exports 
on the growth rate in the second half of the year, we  expect the slowdown in the 
domestic demand to surpass the rise in net exports. In sum,  we expect a continued 
growth slowdown  in the next couple of quarters. The se asonally adjusted figures for 
the August industrial production index and the Septemb er capacity utilization rate 
confirm the slowdown in the growth of the aggregate d emand.                                                                                                            Central Bank of Turkey

The main changes to the background of the forecast since th e publication of 
July Inflation Report are the decline in the risk premi um, output gap estimation 
(related in turn to stronger than expected domestic dem and), the larger than 
envisaged civil service wage award, and the assumption on  oil prices. The July 
inflation forecast assumed that the risk premium would re main constant. We 
envisaged that the decline in the confidence of the dom estic agents after the May-
June sell-off would induce a rapid and sharp drop in th e domestic activity. However, 
the deterioration in global liquidity conditions turn ed out to be short-lived, and thus, 
business confidence rebounded sooner than we have expected . Consequently, 
although we still estimate that economic activity will o perate below capacity,  we now 
view the output gap in the second half of 2006 as sligh tly narrower than previously 
thought (Figure 4). On the other hand, the decline i n the risk premium since end-July 
has induced a tightening in monetary conditions. That i s, although the policy rates 
were kept constant since July, currently the risk adjusted re al rate is higher than 
assumed in the July Inflation Report projections. 
Civil service wage increases were higher than we had assum ed, and could put 
additional pressures on services inflation in particular. Although, our assumption on 
oil prices was revised downwards from 70 to 60 USD per b arrel, the forecasts take 
into account that the accumulated past increases in oil pri ces are most likely to yield 
hikes in the prices of household utilities such as natural g as and electricity, due to 
lagged effects. Throughout the forecast horizon, we exp ect that the unprocessed 
food prices will normalize, oil prices will remain uncha nged, the world growth rate 
will gradually moderate, and the risk premium will sta y constant.

Outlook  
Our computations point out a 1-percentage point inerti al impact on 2007 
inflation due to the second round effects of the pass-thr ough, which can largely be 
attributed to the presence of backward-looking price setti ng behavior especially in 
services inflation. We expect that the tight monetary co nditions and the slowdown in 
the overall economic activity will ease the inflationar y pressures and should limit the 
additional second-round effects of the exchange rate pass -through.  
Against this background, we assess that bringing inflation back to the target 
necessitates a tight policy stance for a considerable period . Our latest forecast 
suggests that  inflation will be between 9.2 and 10.6 percent at the end of 2006 and 
between 1.7 and 5.2 percent by the end of the first q uarter of 2008, with 70 percent 
probability. Therefore, we expect inflation to conver ge to the target in about 6 
quarters, i.e. by the end of 2008 Q1 (Figure 5). 1 The underlying policy path is an 
unchanged interest rate for the next four quarters and  a gradual easing thereafter. It 
is noteworthy to stress that the policy path is conditiona l on the current available 
information, and therefore, subject to change as the ne w information arrives.

Risks 
The first risk factor is a weaker-than-envisaged aggregate  demand slowdown. 
This could be due to hikes in government spending or a sl ower-than-expected 
transmission mechanism of the current monetary stance. Accord ingly, we will closely 
monitor evolving developments in the economy in light  of the cumulative increase in 
the policy rates since June.

The second risk factor is a deterioration in global finan cial market sentiment. 
Global liquidity is still the major factor in shaping r isk appetite and volatility in 
financial markets. Whether it is the risk of inflation or  the risk of a global slowdown, a 
drop in the global risk appetite might lead to anothe r wave of portfolio shock in 
emerging markets, which may necessitate a policy response th rough its impact on 
expectations. It should be stressed that in June we have d esigned a flexible tool to 
cope with such possible sudden changes in the market sentimen t. The current 
liquidity conditions in the domestic money market allow us to engineer a rapid 
tightening in operational policy rates between the tw o MPC meetings. We have 
already announced in our policy statements that the CBT  will not hesitate to resort to 
this kind of tightening, should the market conditions exh ibit a sharp but temporary 
deterioration. In case the deterioration turns out to have permanent effects on the 
medium term inflation outlook, the MPC will revise th e borrowing rate upwards.  It is 
worth to note that, not all the scenarios regarding th e global outlook are negative. 
Although a slowdown in the global economic growth could  have an immediate 
adverse impact on the domestic inflation through its imp act on the risk appetite, it 
could mean lower commodity prices and thus lower inflati on in the medium term as 
well.  
The third risk for the inflation outlook is higher-than -expected inflation inertia, 
as currently manifested in the medium term inflation e xpectations. Given that we 
plan to bring inflation down from 10 percent to 4 pe rcent in a fairly short period of 
time, the degree of stickiness in services inflation emerge s as a major risk to our 
forecast, especially if one considers the recent real increa se in civil service wages. 
The inflation in services (apart from the relatively l ow productivity growth in this 
sector) displays a strong backward looking component, and th us it usually lags 
behind the headline inflation under a disinflation e pisode. Currently, the annual 
percentage change in services price index is around 12 per cent. Our projections 
suggest that the moderation in domestic demand may driv e services inflation down 
to as low as 9 percent next year—contributing 2.5 percent age points to the headline 
inflation in 2007. This means the goods inflation has t o stay close to 2 percent, for 
the headline inflation to adhere to the 4 percent ta rget at the end of 2007.

Conclusion 
Monetary policy has been tightened significantly since mi d-June. This non-
accommodative monetary stance is expected to slow demand a nd bring inflation 
down to its target by the end of 2008 Q1. Although t he accumulated impact of the 
various cost-push shocks combined with the continued exchange rate pass-through 
has kept inflation at high levels, the policy measures we  have taken in June 2006 
have been successful in containing further deterioration in medium term inflation 
expectations. However, there are significant upside risks t o our baseline inflation 
projection. Materialization of such risks will lead the C BT to further tighten the policy 
stance by raising policy rates. That is why we will conduct  monetary policy with a 
tightening bias in the period ahead. In other words, monetary policy will stay more 
attentive to adverse developments than favorable deve lopments regarding inflation 
outlook. This approach reflects our commitment to achievin g the medium term 
inflation target.  
Against this backdrop, we decided jointly with the gover nment to keep the 4 
percent target for 2007. The volatility in the finan cial markets in May-June period in 
Turkey, by all means, can be considered as a significant sho ck. Some countries 
have chosen the strategy to change their targets when th ey were faced with similar 
shocks (See Brazil 2003, for example). Although our base line projections suggest 
that it may take around 6 quarters to bring inflation  back to the target, we see a 
considerable chance that inflation can be brought close to  the 4 percent target at the 
end of 2007, particularly given our tightening bias. More importantly, we believe that 
changing the end-2007 target at this stage could not on ly have adverse implications 
for expectations and wage setting process for 2007 but al so undermine the 
credibility of future policy commitments.  
High primary budget surpluses have supported the disinfl ation process to a 
large extent during the past years. Maintaining and a dvancing the gains achieved 
thus far would benefit from the continuation of the r eforms related European Union 
accession process, and the implementation of structural refo rms, which will ensure 
the sustainability of fiscal discipline in the long run.
