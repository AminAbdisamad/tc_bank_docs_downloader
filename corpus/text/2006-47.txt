Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) adopted a formal inflation-targeting framework at
the beginning of 2006. Accordingly, the end-year inflation target for 2006 was set as
5 percent, defined as the annual change in Consumer Price Index (CPI). To facilitate
the accountability principle, the CBT has disclosed a quarterly path of inflation for
2006 consistent with the end-year target with an uncertainty band of 2 percentage
points on both sides. In adherence with the Article 42 of the Central Bank law, the
CBT committed to provide the Government with a written statement explaining the
reasons for inflation exceeding the upper limit of the uncertainty band and the
measures to be taken to ensure that inflation rate will return to levels within preestablished limits.
Annual CPI inflation in September 2006 was 10.55, breaching the upper limit of
the uncertainty band announced for end-September 2006 at 7.8 percent (Figure 1).
This open letter explains the reasons why inflation exceeded the predetermined
target path by a large margin, evaluates the measures taken by the Central Bank of
Turkey to bring inflation back to the target, and finally presents the medium term
outlook and the horizon in which inflation converges to the medium term target. As
mentioned in our policy statement titled “General Framework of Inflation Targeting
and Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2006” published on December 5, 2005,
this Open Letter will also be presented to the IMF as part of the program
conditionality.

The Reasons For Exceeding The Target
Before starting to present the developments in the last quarter, it would be
useful to recall that in the Open Letter and the Inflation Report published in July
2006, breaching the upper limit of the uncertainty band was attributed to a
combination of several supply shocks such as rising oil prices, increases in the
tobacco product prices, high unprocessed food price inflation, the continued
increases in the gold prices, and the portfolio shock originated from the change in
global liquidity conditions. Although, the relatively strong course of the domestic
demand might have been one of the factors affecting inflation, a careful analysis of
the price data and capacity indicators suggested that the role of the supply factors in
breaching the target, by and large, was dominant. The short-term inflation outlook
has improved since the publication of the July Open Letter. Although the expected
correction in unprocessed food prices has not been observed in the third quarter, the
oil and other commodity prices followed a more favorable course than our baseline
assumptions. This development was particularly important to contain the second
round effects of the high oil prices. The rebound of the New Turkish Lira has also
contributed to the short-term inflation outlook.
The accumulated impact of previous shocks has kept the annual inflation at
high levels. The negative course of unprocessed food prices and the lagged impact
of the exchange rate pass-through drove annual inflation up to 10.55 percent in
September—a figure just about in line with our projections which stood between 10
and 11 percent for end-September inflation in the July Inflation Report.
A close look at the 9-month cumulative price increases in certain subgroups of
CPI unveils the main factors behind the rise in inflation in 2006 (Figure 2). It is clear
from the figure that one of the main reasons for the rise in inflation was the
substantial increase in the unprocessed food prices. The figure also reveals the role
of energy prices as an adverse factor in the first 9 months of 2006 inflation. Rising
inflation in prices of goods excluding energy and unprocessed food can be
explained by the exchange rate pass-through. The services inflation, on the other
hand, exhibited a gradually declining pattern in the past three years.

The research conducted by the CBT staff suggests that the pass-through from
exchange rate to consumer prices is close to 20 percent in a 5-month period. Given
that the depreciation in the New Turkish Lira has been around 15 percent since
April, our calculation of the cumulative pass-through impact on annual inflation is
close to 3 percentage points in the May-September period. In other words, it can be
claimed as a rough cut that annual inflation could have been around 7.5 percent in
the absence of the sell-off in May-June period.
The first round effect of the exchange rate pass-through is almost complete.
The pass-through is expected to be visible through clothing and apparel prices in
October, yet remain at low levels thereafter. Accordingly, we estimate the cumulative
impact of exchange rates on headline inflation to reach 3.5 percentage points until
the end of the year. Assuming that the second round effects are limited, the base
effect should drive annual inflation downwards starting from the second quarter of
2007.
Annual change in the most widely cited core CPI (excluding energy,
unprocessed food, tobacco-alcohol and gold), denoted by H, also continued to
increase during the last quarter due to lagged effects of the exchange rate passthrough, reaching 8.7 percent at the end of September. However, it should be
emphasized that this is an expected outcome since a big fraction of the H index is
durable goods, which is highly sensitive to exchange rate developments.
Accordingly, the fact that inflation measured by H index has been rising in the last
couple of months should not be interpreted as news to the monetary policy.
Although the first round effects of the exchange rate pass through is largely
complete, we expect core inflation figures to stay at high levels due to past
cumulative effects until the second quarter of 2007.

Measures Taken to Ensure the Convergence of Inflation to the Targets
In the July Open Letter, we already mentioned that the volatility in the
exchange rates, coupled with the other cost-push factors such as the strong
commodity prices and rising food prices, has led to a serious deterioration in inflation
expectations in May and June. Central Bank of Turkey implemented a two-pillar
package as a reaction to the volatility in the financial markets and the consequent
rise in inflation expectations. The first pillar of the policy response was a rate hike of
400 percentage points in June, which sent the markets a clear signal of the Central
Bank’s commitment to the medium-term inflation targets. It was also a manifestation
of the end of the “fiscal dominance”.
The second pillar of the package was to withdraw the excess domestic
currency liquidity in the financial markets via deposit purchase auctions and FX
sales, while raising the lending rate up by a total of 6 percentage points. By doing
so, the CBT aimed to reduce the potential volatility in the markets by designing a
flexible mechanism to deal with sudden shifts in the market sentiment. The plan
worked well and the financial markets calmed down. Markets reacted favorably to all
these decisive policy measures and the long-end of the yield curve shifted down.
In the following meeting held on July 20th, the Monetary Policy Committee
(MPC) raised the policy rates by a further 25 basis points and stated that a
measured tightening might be necessary to meet 2007 end-year target. By giving
such a signal, the CBT aimed at containing the second round effects of the
exchange rate pass-through and eliminating the mismatch between inflation
expectations and the medium-term targets.
The medium-term inflation outlook has been affected by many factors since the
July letter. On the positive side, new data suggested that the risks of high inflation in
industrial countries have been easing. The Federal Reserve’s decision, at their
meeting on 8th of August to keep Federal funds rate on hold, has further mitigated
the impact of the May-June sell-off on the domestic markets. This development has
also reduced the risk premium, which further tightened the monetary conditions.
Another positive development was the decline in commodity prices. On the other
hand, domestic demand conditions have not slowed as much as expected, reflecting
sooner-than-expected recovery of the confidence and partly the increase in
government spending. Given these counteracting factors, the uncertainties over the
transmission mechanism and over the impact of the large June-July interest rate
hikes, the MPC did not change the policy rates in August and September meetings
(Table 1).
The September wage award to civil servants is also likely to add to inflationary
pressures, particularly in services. Accordingly, while keeping rates on hold in the
October meeting, MPC stressed the need to maintain a tight policy stance in the
face of continued global imbalances, high inflation expectations, and the increased
risks related to services inflation.

The decisive policy measures taken by the CBT and the demonstration of its
firm commitment to the medium term targets helped to contain the inflation
expectations. The deterioration in medium-term expectations stopped in July. Both
the 12-month and the 24-month ahead inflation expectations exhibited a declining
pattern in the past 2 months (Figure 3). However, the improvement in medium term
expectations was limited, possibly owing to the adaptive behavior coupled with the
elevated headline inflation figures. We expect that inflation expectations will come
down gradually as inflation decelerates in the medium term. The fact that currently
24-month ahead inflation expectations are significantly higher than our medium term
target of 4 percent, however, necessitates a tight policy stance.

Outlook For Inflation and Monetary Policy
The Background and Current Conditions
We assess that monetary policy has been tightened significantly. Implied real
policy rate is 11 percent – a reasonably high figure even if it is corrected with various
kinds of country risk premium measures. The longer-term interest rates such as the
interest rates on government securities and consumer loans suggest even tighter
monetary conditions. Other indicators, such as the slowdown in credit expansion
and the monetary indicators confirm this view. Therefore, although there are
uncertainties over the impact of the policy rates on economic activity, it is
reasonable to assume that current financial conditions and monetary policy stance in
Turkey are non-accommodative.
The tight monetary policy stance is expected to contain the inflationary
pressures starting from the first quarter of 2007. The post-2001 data suggests that
the impact of the real interest on the economic activity is mostly visible in 1 to 3
quarters in the Turkish economy. Indeed, there are some signs of a slowdown in the
domestic demand, although not as pronounced as expected in July: The rapid credit
expansion has been easing since June; the quarter on quarter consumer credit
growth exhibited a significant deceleration in the third quarter of 2006 (Table 2).
Automobile and housing sales registered a sharp decline in the last couple of
months. Consumer confidence index dropped in June and July before it rebounded
modestly. In the meanwhile, annual growth in monetary indicators displayed a
noticeable decline. In sum, recent indicators suggest a considerable slowdown in the
private domestic demand, especially on interest rate sensitive sectors such as car
sales, durable goods and housing. It remains unclear, however, whether aggregate
domestic demand will slowdown at the same pace, especially given the noticeable
public spending and wage increases, and the prevailing uncertainties regarding the
impact of real interest rates on demand conditions.

Although our projections suggest an increase in the contribution of net exports
on the growth rate in the second half of the year, we expect the slowdown in the
domestic demand to surpass the rise in net exports. In sum, we expect a continued
growth slowdown in the next couple of quarters. The seasonally adjusted figures for
the August industrial production index and the September capacity utilization rate
confirm the slowdown in the growth of the aggregate demand.

The main changes to the background of the forecast since the publication of
July Inflation Report are the decline in the risk premium, output gap estimation
(related in turn to stronger than expected domestic demand), the larger than
envisaged civil service wage award, and the assumption on oil prices. The July
inflation forecast assumed that the risk premium would remain constant. We
envisaged that the decline in the confidence of the domestic agents after the MayJune sell-off would induce a rapid and sharp drop in the domestic activity. However,
the deterioration in global liquidity conditions turned out to be short-lived, and thus,
business confidence rebounded sooner than we have expected. Consequently,
although we still estimate that economic activity will operate below capacity, we now
view the output gap in the second half of 2006 as slightly narrower than previously
thought (Figure 4). On the other hand, the decline in the risk premium since end-July
has induced a tightening in monetary conditions. That is, although the policy rates
were kept constant since July, currently the risk adjusted real rate is higher than
assumed in the July Inflation Report projections.
Civil service wage increases were higher than we had assumed, and could put
additional pressures on services inflation in particular. Although, our assumption on
oil prices was revised downwards from 70 to 60 USD per barrel, the forecasts take
into account that the accumulated past increases in oil prices are most likely to yield
hikes in the prices of household utilities such as natural gas and electricity, due to
lagged effects. Throughout the forecast horizon, we expect that the unprocessed
food prices will normalize, oil prices will remain unchanged, the world growth rate
will gradually moderate, and the risk premium will stay constant.

Outlook
Our computations point out a 1-percentage point inertial impact on 2007
inflation due to the second round effects of the pass-through, which can largely be
attributed to the presence of backward-looking price setting behavior especially in
services inflation. We expect that the tight monetary conditions and the slowdown in
the overall economic activity will ease the inflationary pressures and should limit the
additional second-round effects of the exchange rate pass-through.
Against this background, we assess that bringing inflation back to the target
necessitates a tight policy stance for a considerable period. Our latest forecast
suggests that inflation will be between 9.2 and 10.6 percent at the end of 2006 and
between 1.7 and 5.2 percent by the end of the first quarter of 2008, with 70 percent
probability. Therefore, we expect inflation to converge to the target in about 6
quarters, i.e. by the end of 2008 Q1 (Figure 5).1 The underlying policy path is an
unchanged interest rate for the next four quarters and a gradual easing thereafter. It
is noteworthy to stress that the policy path is conditional on the current available
information, and therefore, subject to change as the new information arrives.

* The shaded region indicates the 70 percent confidence interval for the forecast. To make it
compatible with the Inflation Report, we have decided to present the forecasts for a 6-quarter
horizon–up through the first quarter of 2008.

Risks
The first risk factor is a weaker-than-envisaged aggregate demand slowdown.
This could be due to hikes in government spending or a slower-than-expected
transmission mechanism of the current monetary stance. Accordingly, we will closely
monitor evolving developments in the economy in light of the cumulative increase in
the policy rates since June.

Inflation forecast for end-2007 is between 3.5 and 6.8 percent.

The second risk factor is a deterioration in global financial market sentiment.
Global liquidity is still the major factor in shaping risk appetite and volatility in
financial markets. Whether it is the risk of inflation or the risk of a global slowdown, a
drop in the global risk appetite might lead to another wave of portfolio shock in
emerging markets, which may necessitate a policy response through its impact on
expectations. It should be stressed that in June we have designed a flexible tool to
cope with such possible sudden changes in the market sentiment. The current
liquidity conditions in the domestic money market allow us to engineer a rapid
tightening in operational policy rates between the two MPC meetings. We have
already announced in our policy statements that the CBT will not hesitate to resort to
this kind of tightening, should the market conditions exhibit a sharp but temporary
deterioration. In case the deterioration turns out to have permanent effects on the
medium term inflation outlook, the MPC will revise the borrowing rate upwards. It is
worth to note that, not all the scenarios regarding the global outlook are negative.
Although a slowdown in the global economic growth could have an immediate
adverse impact on the domestic inflation through its impact on the risk appetite, it
could mean lower commodity prices and thus lower inflation in the medium term as
well.
The third risk for the inflation outlook is higher-than-expected inflation inertia,
as currently manifested in the medium term inflation expectations. Given that we
plan to bring inflation down from 10 percent to 4 percent in a fairly short period of
time, the degree of stickiness in services inflation emerges as a major risk to our
forecast, especially if one considers the recent real increase in civil service wages.
The inflation in services (apart from the relatively low productivity growth in this
sector) displays a strong backward looking component, and thus it usually lags
behind the headline inflation under a disinflation episode. Currently, the annual
percentage change in services price index is around 12 percent. Our projections
suggest that the moderation in domestic demand may drive services inflation down
to as low as 9 percent next year—contributing 2.5 percentage points to the headline
inflation in 2007. This means the goods inflation has to stay close to 2 percent, for
the headline inflation to adhere to the 4 percent target at the end of 2007.

Conclusion
Monetary policy has been tightened significantly since mid-June. This nonaccommodative monetary stance is expected to slow demand and bring inflation
down to its target by the end of 2008 Q1. Although the accumulated impact of the
various cost-push shocks combined with the continued exchange rate pass-through
has kept inflation at high levels, the policy measures we have taken in June 2006
have been successful in containing further deterioration in medium term inflation
expectations. However, there are significant upside risks to our baseline inflation
projection. Materialization of such risks will lead the CBT to further tighten the policy
stance by raising policy rates. That is why we will conduct monetary policy with a
tightening bias in the period ahead. In other words, monetary policy will stay more
attentive to adverse developments than favorable developments regarding inflation
outlook. This approach reflects our commitment to achieving the medium term
inflation target.
Against this backdrop, we decided jointly with the government to keep the 4
percent target for 2007. The volatility in the financial markets in May-June period in
Turkey, by all means, can be considered as a significant shock. Some countries
have chosen the strategy to change their targets when they were faced with similar
shocks (See Brazil 2003, for example). Although our baseline projections suggest
that it may take around 6 quarters to bring inflation back to the target, we see a
considerable chance that inflation can be brought close to the 4 percent target at the
end of 2007, particularly given our tightening bias. More importantly, we believe that
changing the end-2007 target at this stage could not only have adverse implications
for expectations and wage setting process for 2007 but also undermine the
credibility of future policy commitments.
High primary budget surpluses have supported the disinflation process to a
large extent during the past years. Maintaining and advancing the gains achieved
thus far would benefit from the continuation of the reforms related European Union
accession process, and the implementation of structural reforms, which will ensure
the sustainability of fiscal discipline in the long run.
