With the increase in Turkish lira reserve requirement ratios, Turkish lira
required reserves will increase by approximately TL 1.4 billion. Under the assumption
that the ROM facilities continue to be used at current levels, liquidity amounting to
approximately TL 320 million, FX worth USD 660 million and gold worth USD 290
million will be withdrawn from the market and the effective reserve requirement ratio
for Turkish lira currently standing at 10.8 percent will become 11 percent.
With the increase in FX reserve requirement ratios, liquidity amounting to
approximately USD 940 million will be withdrawn from the market and the effective
reserve requirement ratio for FX currently standing at 11.1 percent will become 11.5
percent.
Reserve requirement ratios will be effective as of the calculation period dated
1 March 2013 and the maintenance period will begin on 15 March 2013.
