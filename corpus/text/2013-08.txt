PRESS RELEASE ON OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS
Based on the projected Turkish lira liquidity needs, the Monetary Policy Committee
(MPC) decided, at its meeting of 19 February 2013, to set the amount of daily funding
via one-week quantity auctions between 0.2 and 6.5 billion Turkish liras until the next
MPC meeting to be held on 26 March 2013.

As for one-month repo auctions, the upper limit for each auction to be held during the
20 February 2013 – 26 March 2013 period has been set as 2.5 billion Turkish liras.

In case of unexpected significant changes in liquidity conditions, the CBRT may opt
to provide funds outside the pre-announced limits.
