liabilities while they have remained unchanged at 12 percent for short-term liabilities.
Thus, FX required reserve ratios are as follows:
FX Liabilities
Deposits/participation accounts with 1-year and longer
maturity and cumulative deposits/participation accounts
Other FX liabilities up to 3-year maturity
(including 3-year)
Other FX liabilities longer than 3-year maturity

The abovementioned regulation will be effective as of 22 July 2011 and the required
reserves calculated using the new ratios will start to be maintained as of 5 August
2011. Therefore, based on current data, liquidity amounting to approximately USD
590 million will be provided to the market.
