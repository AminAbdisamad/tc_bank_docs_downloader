CENTRAL BANK OF THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
PRESS RELEASE
The Central Bank has put the following measures into effect with the aim of minimizing
the adverse effects of the military operation to Iraq that started on March 20, 2003 on
domestic markets, preserving what we have accomplished so far on the way to achieving
price stability, and maintaining the banking and financial stability.
A)

TL Money Market

Currently, the amount of liquidity in the Turkish lira money markets is adequate to meet
the liquidity needs of the financial system. However, the Central Bank has made the following
arrangements in order to meet an additional liquidity need that might emerge in the markets:

B)

•

The interest rate charged for funding the banks without any limit via the “Late
Liquidity Window” facility at the Interbank Money Market operating under the
Central Bank, currently operating between 16:00-16:30 has been decreased by 5
points to 56 percent.

•

On the other hand, when necessary, the Central Bank will also provide O/N
funding at the Istanbul Stock Exchange Repurchase Market at 51 percent.
Foreign Exchange Market

The foreign exchange balance, and the level of foreign exchange liquidity in the banking
system have been strengthened as a result of the Central Bank’s strict implementation of the
floating exchange-rate regime that was initiated in February 2001, and due to the fact that
banks have attached great importance to their exchange-rate risk management. The Central
Bank has taken the following measures for the smooth functioning of the foreign exchange
market in order to meet the additional demand for foreign exchange that might occur in the
market due to extraordinary conditions we face taday.
•

Banks will be provided with one-week maturity foreign exchange deposit facility
within their limit of borrowing in the Foreign Exchange Deposit Market at the
Central Bank. As of today, the interest rate to be applied to the said deposits has
been cut down to 8 percent from 12 percent.

•

All necessary preparations have been made and the amount of foreign currency
banknotes held at the branches of the Central Bank has been increased to meet
demand for foreign currency banknotes that might emerge in this period. In this
context, the demand for foreign currency banknotes against foreign exchange of all
the institutions authorized to operate in the Foreign Exchange and Foreign
Banknotes Markets with the Central Bank will be met.

•

The current economic program had important achievements on the way to price
stability which is the main target of the Central Bank and it is of utmost
importance to minimize the volatility in foreign exchange that might risk those
achievements. We have no doubt that the players in the financial system will
show the common sense needed at this sensitive period. Nonetheless, the Central
Bank will closely monitor the excessive volatility that might occur in exchange
rates due to liquidity shortage in the market, or speculative actions and as before,
will directly intervene in the event of an excessive volatility that might occur in
both directions.
