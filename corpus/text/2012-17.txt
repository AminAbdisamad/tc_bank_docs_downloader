SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: March 27, 2012

Inflation Developments
1. In February, consumer prices were up 0.56 percent and annual inflation went
down to 10.43 percent. As stated in the previous Summary of the Monetary Policy
Committee (the Committee) Meeting, food inflation decreased, while energy
prices increased amid the soaring international oil prices in this period. Core
inflation indicators posted a decline after a long interval and services maintained
their moderate course.
2. Annual inflation in food and nonalcoholic beverages group continued with their
downward trends. Amid the sustained favorable outlook in the prices of fresh fruits
and vegetables compared to the seasonal averages, unprocessed food inflation
went down to 13.21 percent in February. Similarly, annual processed food
inflation decreased in this period as it did in January. Nevertheless, leading
indicators suggest that annual inflation in both main food groups may increase in
March.
3. In February, repercussions of international oil price developments continued
through fuel prices and annual energy inflation increased approximately by 1
percentage point to 12.60 percent due to the low base. Uncertainties in oil prices
pose upside risks to the inflation outlook. As a matter of fact, leading indicators
suggest that the increase in energy prices will persist in March as well.
4. Annual services inflation edged down to 6.27 percent. Annual inflation in transport
services, which has recently trended upwards amid the increase in fuel prices,
posted a slowdown, while services prices excluding catering and transport
remained flat at 4.9 percent. Rent increases stood at low levels in this period as
well. Meanwhile, seasonally adjusted prices of services and diffusion index
suggest that the underlying trend of service inflation has sustained its mild
outlook.
5. Due to the developments in the prices of durable goods, annual inflation in core
goods recorded a decline, while seasonally adjusted clothing prices increased
further. In line with the alleviation of the cumulative effects of exchange rate
movements, the decline annual core goods inflation is expected to continue in the
period ahead.

Factors Affecting Inflation
6. Following the robust course in the final quarter of 2011, economic activity
displayed a domestic-demand-driven deceleration in the first quarter of 2012.
Seasonally adjusted industrial production plummeted in January below the
average of the previous quarter. Domestic sales of light and heavy commercial
vehicles posted a decline in the January-February period compared to the
average of the previous quarter. Moreover, seasonally adjusted consumer loans
confirmed the deceleration in domestic demand in the first quarter of the year.
7. Leading indicators suggest a modest recovery in consumption demand in the
second quarter. Despite its low level, consumer confidence has improved in
recent months. Following the decline in January, expectations on domestic new
orders have assumed a gradual recovery trend. Additionally, the absence of any
notable setback in new investment plans of the manufacturing firms coupled with
the consistent upward trend in non-farm employment indicate that there is no
permanent deterioration in expectations on demand. The Committee attributed
the slowdown in economic activity in the early 2012 to temporary factors besides
the tightening policy measures, and assessed that domestic demand would
resume its upward trend in the period ahead.
8. Recent developments indicate that the rebalancing between domestic and
external demand continues in the first quarter. Notwithstanding the persisting
problems in the European economy, exports continue to grow at a steady pace.
The ongoing slowdown in domestic demand and the cumulative depreciation in
the Turkish lira continue to restrict the import demand and non-energy current
account deficit. Accordingly, despite the elevated oil prices, the gradual
improvement in the current account balance is expected to continue in the
forthcoming period. The Committee highlighted that the correction in the 12-month
cumulative current account deficit, which started in November, would become
more pronounced in late March.

9. Labor market data confirm the deceleration in economic activity. Employment in
the construction sector continues to decline, employment in the services sector
has recently lost pace. However, having noted that the two subsequent months of
decline came to a halt in industrial employment, the Committee stated that
employment would continue to grow modestly amid the recovery in economic
activity. As a matter of fact, survey data point to a partial recovery in job
opportunities. Nevertheless, the possible domestic consequences of global
uncertainties on economic activity stand out as the factors that may restrain
employment growth in the period ahead.

Riskler ve Para Politikası
10. The Committee has indicated that both the level and the composition of the
economic activity as well as the bank lending evolve as expected. Accordingly,
economic activity is anticipated to pick up gradually starting from the second
quarter. Although loan growth rate may accelerate somewhat in the forthcoming
period, seasonally adjusted values are expected to stay in line with the
assumptions of the January Inflation Report.
11. The Committee has stated that short term inflation developments are also in line
with the path projected in the Inflation Report. Oil prices hover at higher levels
than assumed in the baseline scenario, leading to a higher than expected path in
energy prices. However, so far this is largely offset by the favorable outlook in
unprocessed food prices.
12. According to the Committee members, energy prices pose upside risks regarding
the short-term inflation outlook, whereas risks are on the downside for
unprocessed food prices. Especially, it is stated that possible hikes in electricity
and natural gas rates could lead to a significant increase in energy prices. The
Committee has underscored that supply side developments will be closely
monitored and any deterioration in inflation expectations will not be tolerated.
13. Given the current levels of inflation, it is important to prevent upside risks.
Therefore, the Central Bank has implemented a new round of additional monetary
tightening in order to eliminate the impact of recent cost developments on inflation
expectations. Factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored in the
forthcoming period and additional monetary tightening will be repeated, when
necessary.
14. Given the prevailing uncertainties regarding the global economy, it would be
appropriate to preserve the flexibility of the monetary policy. Therefore, the impact
of the measures undertaken on credit, domestic demand, and inflation

expectations will be monitored closely and the funding amount will be adjusted in
either direction, as needed.
15. Moreover, taking the liquidity projections into account, the ranges for weekly and
monthly Turkish lira funding have been revised. In addition, certain revisions
regarding the fraction of required reserves that can be held in gold have been
approved. The Committee indicated that these measures will support financial
stability, yet they will not have a significant impact on the stance of monetary
policy.
16. Monetary policy will continue to focus on price stability while preserving financial
stability as a supplementary objective. To this end, the impact of the
macroprudential measures taken by the Central Bank and other institutions on the
inflation outlook will be assessed carefully. Strengthening the structural reform
agenda to ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the saving
deficit will support the relative improvement of Turkey’s sovereign risk, and thus
facilitate price stability and financial stability in the medium term. These measures
will also provide more flexibility for monetary policy and contribute to social
welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels.
In this respect, steps towards the implementation of the structural reforms
envisaged by the Medium Term Program remain to be of utmost importance.
