SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: July 21, 2011

Inflation Developments
1. In June, consumer prices decreased by 1.43 percent, and annual inflation
went down to 6.24 percent. As foreseen in the summary of the June Monetary
Policy Committee (the Committee) meeting, this decline was largely driven by
the developments in unprocessed food prices due to correction in fresh fruit
prices. Hence, annual inflationreverted back to theprojected path in the April
Inflation Report.
2. Prices of food and nonalcoholic beverages decreased by 6.40 percent
following the downward correction in theunprocessed food price index, and the
group’s annual inflation went down by 4.48 percentage points to 8.13 percent.
On the processed food front, prices of fats and oilscontinued to rise in June,
while ongoing decreases in meat and dairy prices contained the increases in
processed food prices.
3. Prices of services rose by 0.76 percent in June, while annual services inflation
increased by 0.58 percentage points to 5.02 percent. This rise in annual
inflation was driven by prices of tour packages.Due to lagged effects of rising
fuelprices,the rate of increase in transport prices gained a slight momentum.
Rentscontinued to rise moderately. On the other hand, seasonally adjusted
figures indicate that prices ofservices posted a slower quarter-on-quarter
increase in the second quarter.
4. Annual core goods (excluding food, energy, alcoholic beverages, tobacco and
gold) inflation continued to risedue to cumulative increases in import prices,to
5.56 percent in June.Among durable goods (excluding gold), automobile and
furniture prices surged, whereas prices of white goods fell. The rate of
increase in clothing prices continued to rise year-on-year.However, seasonally
adjusted data indicate a deceleration in the core goods inflation.
5. While core inflationindicators increased in June owing to the developments in
prices of services and core goods, theirunderlying trend followed a downward
path. TheCommittee anticipates that core inflation is likely to display some
upward movement over the short term, but the increase is expected to be
limited due to the slowdown in economic activity.

Factors Affecting Inflation
6. Recent data releases are broadly consistent with the outlook presented in the
April Inflation Report. Second-quarter data indicate a pronounced slowdown in
economic activity. In fact, seasonally adjusted industrial production was down
for four consecutive months since February,and materialized below the firstquarter average in the April-May period. Similarly, the manufacturing industry
capacity utilization rate, which has been declining since the turn of the year,
remained flat in June, pointing thatrecently economic activityremains weak.
7. Private consumption shows signs of slowdown, while investment growth is
moderating. Production and imports of consumption goods remained below
first-quarterfigures in the April-May period.Indicators on investment demand
suggest a deceleration as well. Meanwhile, the sales data also confirm the
slowdown in domestic demand.
8. External demand outlook remains weak. Recent data indicate a limited
recovery in exports for the second quarter. Both global PMI indices and recent
figures for new orders suggest that external demand conditions would remain
weak in the third quarter. In fact, low levels of capacity utilization rates persist
due to weak external demand. Considering the mounting uncertainty regarding
the global economy, the Committee has reiterated that exports would recover
slowly and gradually.
9. Employment conditions continue to improve, with unemployment rates back to
pre-crisis levels.After the first quarter’s faster-than-expected growth, non-farm
employment continued to risein April. Leading indicators suggest that
thisuptrend in non-farm employment would continue at a slower pace in the
short term. The Committee has stated that,despiteimproved employment
conditions, unit labor costs decreased due to strong productivity gains.
Monetary Policy and Risks
10. The Committee has indicated that, due to the measures taken so far, the
domestic demand is now under control and reiterated that the current account
balance will start to improve in the final quarter of the year. It was stated that
the recent measures taken by the Banking Regulation and Supervision
Agency and the tight fiscal policy stance support the policy mix implemented
by the Central Bank, and thus contribute to the rebalancing of domestic and
external demand. Although the rate of credit growth has yet to decline to the
levels compatible with the financial stability, the Committee members expect

further deceleration in the second half of the year owing to the lagged impact
of tightening policies.
11. In light of these assessments, combined with the heightened uncertainty
regarding the global economy and the slowdown in domestic economic
activity, the Committee has decided to maintain the current policy mix.
12. The Committee has also assessed the forecasts prepared for the July Inflation
Report. It was concluded that inflation forecast path would remain largely
unchanged, since there has been no significant revision in the underlying
assumptions compared to the April Inflation Report. Nevertheless, the
Committee members underscored that developments since the April Inflation
Report have increased the downside risks regarding the global economy; and
therefore, this view should be emphasized in the Inflation Report and other
communication documents regarding monetary policy.
13. Problems in credit, real estate and labor markets in advanced economies are
yet to be solved. Moreover, concerns on fiscal dynamics in these economies
still persist. Especially, mounting problems regarding sovereign debt of the
euro area peripheral economies have increased the downside risks on the
global economy. The Committee members indicated that it would be
appropriate to narrow the interest corridor gradually should the sovereign debt
problems regarding some European economies and the concerns on global
growth continue to have adverse impact on the risk appetite. Moreover, the
Committee stated that all policy instruments may be eased, should global
economic problems intensify and lead to a contraction in domestic economic
activity.
14. Even if the debt problems in the euro area are resolved before they turn into a
global crisis, it is still likely to experience an extended period of weak
economic activity in advanced economies coupled with continued growth in
emerging markets driven by domestic demand. In such a case, there may be a
resurge in short term speculative capital inflow to emerging markets. This
would also mean weak external demand and elevated commodity prices,
feeding into macro-financial risks for the domestic economy, fueled by the
rising capital inflows. The Committee stated that, should this scenario
materialize, low policy rates and high reserve requirements may be preserved
for an extended period to contain the risks against price and financial stability.
15. Developments in exchange rates and import prices have been putting
pressure on core inflation since the last quarter of 2010. The hike in customs
duties on fabric and apparel imports is another factor that could lift up the core
inflation indicators. Under current circumstances the increase in core inflation
reflects relative price movements, as the existing output gap contains the
second round effects of relative price movements. However, the core inflation

is expected to further increase in the forthcoming period, posing upside risks
regarding inflation expectations and price setting behavior. The Committee will
not hesitate to tighten monetary policy, should such a risk materialize and
threaten the achievement of medium term inflation targets. The exact mix to
be used for policy tightening in such a case will depend on developments
regarding domestic demand, capital flows, current account and credit growth.
16. The Committee expects the impact of the ongoing tightening measures on
credit volume and domestic demand to be more significant during the second
half of the year. However, the extent and the timing of the impact may vary
depending on the developments beyond the control of monetary policy. The
lagged effects of the policy measures on price and financial stability will be
closely monitored and additional measures will be taken if deemed necessary.
17. The Committee will continue to monitor fiscal policy developments closely
while conducting monetary policy. Sustaining the fiscal discipline under current
circumstances is essential to limit the risks posed by the current account
deficit driven by the disparity between domestic and external demand. Saving
the extra revenues acquired throughthe tax amnesty and strong economic
activity would not only reduce price and financial stability risks, but also
increase the efficiency of the new policy mix. In this respect, inflation forecasts
presented in the baseline scenario of the July Inflation Report assume that the
extra budget revenues will be saved to a large extent. A revision in the
monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal stance deviate
significantly from this framework and consequently have an adverse effect on
the medium-term inflation outlook.
18. Monetary policy will continue to focus on price stability while preserving
financial stability as a supplementary objective. To this end, the impact of the
macroprudential measures taken by the Central Bank and other institutions on
the inflation outlook will be assessed carefully. Strengthening the commitment
to fiscal discipline and the structural reform agenda in the medium term would
support the relative improvement of Turkey’s sovereign risk, and thus facilitate
macroeconomic and price stability. Sustaining the fiscal discipline will also
provide more flexibility for monetary policy and support the social welfare by
keeping interest rates permanently at low levels. In this respect, timely
implementation of the structural reforms envisaged by the Medium Term
Program and the European Union acquis communautaire remains to be of
utmost importance.
