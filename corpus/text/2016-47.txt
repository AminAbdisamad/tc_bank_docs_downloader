Press Release on Reserve Requirements
Reserve option coefficients have been changed to provide additional FX liquidity to
the financial system. Accordingly, the coefficients for the second, third and fourth
tranches of the FX facility of Reserve Option Mechanism have been decreased by 0.2
points. Should the reserve option utilization rates remain unchanged, approximately
620 million US dollars of liquidity will be provided to the financial system with these
changes.
In addition, upper limit of FX reserve requirements that can be maintained as average
has been increased to 4 points from 3 points in order to facilitate FX liquidity
management of banks. With this amendment, banks will be able to freely use an
additional amount of approximately 2.9 billion US dollars to meet their FX liquidity
needs within the maintenance period.
