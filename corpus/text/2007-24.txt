DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Meeting Date: September 13, 2007
Committee Members
Durmuş Yılmaz (Governor), Erdem Başçı, Burhan Göklemez, M. İbrahim Turhan,
Mehmet Yörükoğlu.

The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) decided to lower the
policy rates as follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate from 17.50 to 17.25 percent, and
lending rate from 22.50 to 22.25 percent,
b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate applied between 4:00 p.m. –
5:00 p.m. from 13.50 to 13,25 percent, lending rate from 25.50 to 22,25 percent,
c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided
for primary dealers via repo transactions from 21.50 to 21,25 percent.
Readings on economic activity and inflation are in line with the outlook presented
in the July Inflation Report. While private consumption and investment demand exhibits
signs of recovery, external demand moderates. Aggregate demand conditions continue to
support the disinflation process. The Committee assesses that developments in services
inflation have been more favorable than expected. Notwithstanding the risks related to
energy and food prices, inflation is expected to further decelerate owing to the lagged
effects of strong monetary tightening.
The Committee closely monitors the developments in international liquidity
conditions and credit markets. In the meeting, the Committee evaluated the recent data,
and assessed that global developments are likely to restrain both the domestic and
external demand growth, increasing the downward risks on achieving the 4 percent target
in the medium term.
In this respect, the Committee decided that current conditions require launching
the measured rate cuts mentioned in the Inflation Report. The Committee underlines that
the current monetary policy stance continues to be restrictive. The exact timing and
extent of further easing may vary depending on the incoming information regarding global
liquidity conditions, external demand, public expenditures and other determinants of
medium term inflation outlook.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation
outlook will lead the Committee to reconsider its stance.
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight
working days.
