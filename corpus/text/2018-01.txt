Decision of the Monetary Policy
Committee
18 January 2018, No: 2018-01
Participating Committee Members
Murat Çetinkaya (Governor), Ömer Duman, Erkan Kilimci, Emrah Şener, Murat Uysal, Abdullah
Yavaş.
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest
rates constant at the following levels:
a)
Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 9.25 percent and borrowing rate at
7.25 percent,
b)

One-week repo rate at 8 percent,

c)
Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0
percent, and lending rate at 12.75 percent.
Recently released data indicate that economic activity maintains its strength. Domestic demand
continues to expand and external demand contributes positively to exports.
Current elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations continue to pose risks on the pricing
behavior. Accordingly, the Committee decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance.
The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability
objective. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until inflation outlook
displays a significant improvement, independent of base effects and temporary factors, and
becomes consistent with the targets. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors
affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be
delivered.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its
stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working
days.
