SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: December 18, 2008
Inflation Developments
1. Consumer prices increased by 0.83 percent in November and annual inflation
declined to 10.76 percent. Processed food and energy inflation eased on the
back of falling commodity prices, while exchange rate pass-through to
domestic prices remained limited. In addition, services inflation continued to
moderate owing to the weakening in domestic demand.
2. Processed food prices fell in November, whereas unprocessed food prices
continued to rise on soaring vegetable prices. Annual inflation in processed
food prices registered a cumulative drop of 8.6 points in four months, and is
expected to decelerate further in the upcoming period.
3. Owing mainly to the last year’s base effect created by the excise tax hikes and
the sharp increase in water rates, annual energy price inflation declined by 6.9
points to 24.09 percent in November. Given the reductions in fuel and LPG
prices in December, energy prices will continue to support disinflation.
4. Annual inflation in goods excluding energy and food declined by about 1.3
points to 3.83 percent, mainly on account of the moderation in clothing price
inflation driven by weak demand conditions. In the durables group (excl. gold),
annual inflation rose by about 1 point due to the lagged impact of exchange
rate movements. The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) noted that
the short-term exchange rate pass-through in durable goods has been
significantly lower than the levels implied by the historical estimates.
5. The easing in supply shocks and the softening in domestic demand continued
to have a favorable impact on services prices in November, bringing its annual
inflation down to 10.88 percent. Rent inflation continued to moderate. Annual
inflation in catering prices has further declined on slowing food inflation and
weakening domestic demand. Moreover, the fall in fuel prices has started to
put downward pressure on transport prices. Accordingly, seasonally adjusted
core inflation indicators also remained on a downward track.

Factors Affecting Inflation
6. Third quarter GDP developments were largely consistent with the outlook
provided in the October Inflation Report. Public spending and net exports were
the main drivers of GDP growth. Imports contracted for the first time since the
fourth quarter of 2001, and the contribution of net exports turned positive. On
the other hand, the contribution of private domestic demand declined
considerably, especially owing to the weakening in investments. Thus, annual
GDP growth in the third quarter decelerated significantly down to 0.5 percent.
Moreover, seasonally adjusted figures suggest that quarterly GDP growth was
negative in the second and third quarters of 2008.
7. Indicators on economic activity suggest that the adverse impact of the global
economic downturn on both domestic and aggregate demand has intensified
in the fourth quarter. Readings on production, capacity utilization, and
business confidence point to a marked contraction in economic activity.
8. Ongoing problems in global financial markets have led to a slump in consumer
confidence. Following the sharp drop in October, consumer confidence
indexes remained at low levels in November. The softening in consumption,
the tightening of financial conditions, and the reduction in loan supply has
restrained credit growth. Accordingly, consumer loans slowed down
considerably in October and November.
9. Other indicators for consumer demand also suggest a weakening in the fourth
quarter. Domestic sales of automobiles plummeted in October and November,
falling well below the third-quarter average. Moreover, seasonally adjusted
consumption indexes point to a contraction in private consumer demand in
November. Imports of consumer goods, especially passenger cars and nondurable goods, continued to trend downward.
10. Indicators remain weak for investments. In seasonally adjusted terms,
machinery-equipment production fell for the fourth quarter in a row. Imports of
capital goods in October were below their third-quarter average. Domestic
sales of commercial vehicles displayed a downward trend in October and
November, while Business Tendency Survey pointed to a significant
deterioration in expected investment spending.
11. Besides the marked reduction in domestic demand, foreign demand has also
significantly weakened due to the marked slowdown in global economic
activity. Exports fell by 6.5 percent year-on-year in October and posted a steep
decline in seasonally adjusted terms. Exports of motor vehicles − a key driver
of total exports − fell by 43.9 percent year-on-year in November. The
slowdown in imports has also intensified in October, which was down by 15.3
percent in year-on-year terms. Given the fact that imports declined at a faster

pace than exports, net foreign demand is expected to make a positive
contribution to growth in the final quarter.
12. Data on labor market confirms the significant slowdown in economic activity.
Non-farm employment remained flat in the third quarter, resulting in a marked
rise in unemployment rate. The Committee emphasized that the labor market
conditions will continue to restrain domestic demand and labor costs.

Monetary Policy and Risks
13. Recent readings indicate that the slowdown in the domestic economic activity
has intensified. Ongoing problems in international credit markets and the
global economy are expected to continue to restrain both the domestic and
external demand for an extended period, putting downward pressure on
inflation. The disinflation in core price indices has been so far limited due to
the lagged impact of the exchange rate pass-through. Yet, the Committee
expects a more significant deceleration in the underlying inflation as the
services inflation eases in the forthcoming period.
14. The developments in oil and other commodity prices are having a favorable
impact on disinflation. In fact, the contribution of energy and food prices is
down by 1.4 percentage points since June. Looking ahead, energy and food
prices are expected to continue to contribute to the disinflation process.
15. Although inflation expectations have shown signs of easing recently, they are
still above the medium term targets. The Committee judged that inflation
expectations will follow a downward trend in the forthcoming period as the
deceleration in headline inflation becomes more significant. In this respect, it
was stated that the Central Bank should put more emphasis in its own inflation
forecasts.
16. In light of these assessments, the Committee judged that inflation would
display a rapid fall in the forthcoming period. Accordingly, the Committee has
decided to lower short-term interest rates by 125 basis points. The cumulative
rate cuts have reached 175 basis points in the last two months.
17. Considering the prevailing tightness in financial conditions and the benign
inflation outlook, the Committee indicated that there was room for further
monetary accommodation. However, it was stated that, given the existing
global uncertainties, it would be appropriate to maintain flexibility regarding
future policy decisions. In this respect, the extent and the timing of the next
rate cut will depend on the factors affecting inflation outlook.

18. Uncertainties regarding the impact of the problems in financial markets on the
real economy remain at high levels. Recently, the forecasts on global
economic growth have been continuously revised downwards. Given that
factors affecting domestic inflation have been driven largely by global
developments, medium term inflation risks are seen mostly on the downside.
19. The Central Bank will continue to take the necessary measures to contain the
adverse effects of the global financial turmoil on the domestic economy,
provided that they do not conflict with the price stability objective. Prudent
monetary policy is necessary but not sufficient to maintain the resilience of the
economy against the global financial turmoil. Preserving the fiscal discipline
and strengthening the structural reform agenda would also help to mitigate the
adverse effects of the ongoing shocks on the domestic economy. In this
respect, the European Union accession process and the implementation of
structural reforms envisaged in the economic program remain to be of utmost
importance. In particular, advances in structural reforms, which would improve
the quality of fiscal discipline and enhance productivity gains, are monitored
closely by the Central Bank with regard to their implications on
macroeconomic and price stability.
