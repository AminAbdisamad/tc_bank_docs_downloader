THE CBRT PRESS RELEASE
ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE BUYING AUCTIONS

In order to resolve the problems pertaining to the government debts of the
European countries, crucial decisions were made during the European Union
Leaders’ Summit last week. It is evaluated that it will be appropriate to suspend the
foreign exchange buying auctions in the upcoming period, in which the
implementation of these decisions and their reflections on the markets will be
monitored. In this framework, starting from 25 July 2011 (as of today) the foreign
exchange buying auctions are suspended.
Our strategy related to the foreign exchange buying auctions may again be
evaluated in the upcoming period and the aforementioned auctions may be resumed.
