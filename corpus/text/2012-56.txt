SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 20 November 2012

Inflation Developments
1. In October, consumer prices were up by 1.96 percent and annual inflation went
down to 7.80 percent mainly owing to unprocessed food prices. Core inflation
indicators continued with a downward course amid cost and demand-side
developments, while prices of services remained mild. Hikes in the SCT (Special
Consumption Tax) rates besides natural gas and electricity tariffs are estimated to
add around 1 to 1.1 percentage points to the annual inflation.
2. On the food and non-alcoholic beverages front, annual inflation went down to 7.87
percent. Following the upward trend in the third quarter, seasonally adjusted
unprocessed food prices displayed a decline in October. Due to flat course of
vegetable prices, which soared in October in past years, annual unprocessed
food inflation decreased by 5.5 percentage points to 5.35 percent. Leading
indicators point that annual unprocessed food inflation will fall notably in
November as well. As for the processed foods, bread and cereals group prices
continued to register increases, amid rising wheat prices. Processed food prices
excluding breads and cereals also accelerated in October. Consequently, a rise in
annual processed food inflation is registered.
3. Hikes in the natural gas and electricity tariffs coupled with tax adjustments in fuel
oil led the annual energy inflation to climb to 15 percent.
4. On the services front, annual inflation edged up in October. This rise was driven
by the increases in the prices of communication services. In the services group
excluding communication, annual inflation decreased in October as it did in
September. In October, the underlying trend of seasonally-adjusted prices
remained on a mild track, while the diffusion index of the prices of services
continued to increase.
5. Annual inflation in core goods group fell by 1.32 percentage points to 5.1 percent
in October. This decline was apparent in all the main sectors of core goods, and
particularly in durable goods. Seasonally adjusted data show that the slowdown in
the underlying trend of core inflation indicators continued.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6. Economic activity followed a moderate pace in the third quarter. A sizeable
increase was seen in industrial production in September, yet it was attributed to
the compensation of the decline led by the divergence in the official and actual

numbers of the days-off in August. In fact, the third-quarter average of the
industrial production index increased modestly quarter on quarter.
7. Recent data releases point that economic activity will be stronger in the final
quarter compared to the previous quarter. Although sales of automobiles declined
on an annual basis in October, they remained above the average of the third
quarter. Three-month-ahead expectations for orders of the manufacturing industry
firms continued to increase owing to both domestic and external orders. PMI data
also displayed a similar trend. Investment tendency still follows a relatively weak
course, albeit an increase recently after an extended period. Monetary Policy
Committee (Committee) stated that confidence indices are yet to improve and the
uncertainties in external financial markets may put a cap on the economic activity.
8. The latest data confirm that the rebalancing between the domestic and external
demand continues as envisaged. While imports declined in the third quarter upon
the slowdown in credit growth besides the relative price movements, exports
continue to increase despite the weakening global outlook. Overall, 12-month
cumulative current account deficit continues to decline gradually. On the other
hand, the Committee highlighted that the rebalancing process may lose pace due
to the pick-up in domestic demand in the last quarter of the year.
9. Employment rate displayed a mild increase on account of the slowdown in
economic activity. Despite the rise in non-farm employment in August, there was
a limited increase in the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate, owing to an
increase in the participation rate. The rise in the non-farm employment rate is
attributed to the construction and services sectors. Having exhibited a limited
trend of decline since the March period, employment in the industrial sector
declined further in August. Despite the recent rise in PMI employment index and
industrial production, other leading indicators for the industrial employment signal
that employment growth may be limited in the forthcoming period. Moreover,
uncertainties regarding the global economy remain to be critical factors that may
restrain the employment growth.
Monetary Policy and Risks
10. During the meeting, the Committee assessed the developments regarding price
stability and financial stability. In terms of inflation the main variables of interest
were aggregate demand outlook, output gap indicators, and cost factors. With
regard to macro financial risks, the focus was on credit, current account balance,
and real exchange rate developments.
11. According to the Committee, demand side indicators support the downward trend
in inflation. Aggregate demand growth has slowed down markedly in the third
quarter, mainly driven by developments in final private domestic demand.

Although domestic demand shows some recovery for the final quarter of the year,
aggregate demand conditions are still expected to support disinflation.
12. The Committee assessed that cost factors have been contributing to the
disinflation as well. With the recent stable course of exchange rates and
commodity prices, the accumulated pass-through effects of cost-push factors
observed in 2011 have been fading away. Accordingly, core goods inflation has
been falling markedly since the beginning of the year. Meanwhile, the underlying
trend of services inflation has displayed a benign course.
13. Taking these assessments into account, the Committee expects that year-end
inflation will be lower than the forecast presented at the October Inflation Report,
owing to the favorable course of unprocessed food prices. However, indirect
effects of recent increases in administered and energy prices are closely
monitored in terms of medium term inflation outlook.
14. The Committee stated that, as of the third quarter rebalancing in the composition
of aggregate demand and thus the improvement in the current account balance
continues, and credit volumes keep growing at reasonable rates consistent with
the financial stability objectives. On the other hand, it was indicated that the
steady real appreciation trend in domestic currency observed since the beginning
of the year should be closely monitored. The Committee reminded that, under the
current regime, there is no commitment regarding the level of the exchange rate;
yet, in terms of macroeconomic and financial stability, it is important to take
measures against excessive deviations from economic fundamentals, as needed.
15. The Committee attributes special emphasis on credit developments under the
new policy framework. Given the weak outlook for global demand, keeping the
rate of credit growth at moderate levels is especially important for ensuring that
both the level and the composition of the aggregate demand move towards
desired direction. In this context, it was underlined that credit growth rates not
exceeding 15 percent annually would support both the price and financial stability.
16. The Committee stated that improved risk appetite towards Turkish economy
provided room for a limited hike in reserve option coefficients. It was indicated that
both the improved risk appetite and the adoption of reserve option mechanism
have eased the need for a wide interest rate corridor. Moreover, the moderate
pace of commercial loan growth has allowed for a measured cut in the upper
bound of the corridor. The Committee has therefore stated that increasing the
reserve option coefficients and narrowing the interest rate corridor by a measured
amount would support financial stability.
17. The Committee indicated that ongoing uncertainties regarding the global economy
necessitate the monetary policy to remain flexible in both directions. Therefore,
the impact of the measures undertaken on credit, domestic demand, and inflation

expectations will be monitored closely and the funding amount will be adjusted in
either direction, as needed.
18. In light of these assessments it was stated that, if deemed necessary for financial
stability, a measured cut may be considered in the policy rate and the overnight
borrowing rate in the forthcoming period.
19. The Committee monitors fiscal policy developments closely while formulating
monetary policy. Current projections for price stability and financial stability
outlook take the framework outlined in the Medium Term Program as given. In this
respect, it is assumed that in the forthcoming period fiscal discipline will be
sustained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices. A
revision in the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal
stance deviate significantly from this framework and consequently have an
adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
20. Prudent fiscal policy is crucial for preserving the resilience of our economy against
existing global uncertainties. Strengthening the structural reform agenda that
would ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings
deficit would support the relative improvement of Turkey's sovereign risk, and
thus facilitate price stability and financial stability in the medium-term. This will
also provide more flexibility for monetary policy and contribute to social welfare by
keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels. In this
respect, steps towards implementation of the structural reforms envisaged by the
Medium Term Program remain to be of utmost importance.
