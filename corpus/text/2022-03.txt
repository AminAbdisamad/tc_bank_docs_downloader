The Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye has decided to provide incentive to domestic
legal persons holding deposits and participation funds in the event that their FX and gold
deposit accounts and participation funds are converted into Turkish lira time deposit
accounts at the account holder’s request.

To support financial stability by increasing the share of Turkish lira in total deposits/participation
funds in the banking system, it was previously announced that domestic real persons holding
deposits and participation funds would be provided with incentive in the event that they
converted their FX and gold deposit accounts and participation funds into TL time deposit
accounts.
Now, the CBRT has decided to provide incentive also to domestic legal persons holding deposits
and participation funds in the event that they convert their FX and gold deposit accounts and
participation funds into TL time deposit accounts and participation funds.
