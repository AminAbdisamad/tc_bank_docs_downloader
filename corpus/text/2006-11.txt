PRESS RELEASE ABOUT TURKEY’S
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS STATISTICS AND
INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION

The International Investment Position table (IIP), which reports the stocks of external
financial assets and liabilities of Turkey at a reference date is started to be disseminated in
http://www.tcmb.gov.tr internet address. The conceptual framework, definitions and
classification standards of the IIP are broadly consistent with the International Monetary
Fund’s fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual.
Within this framework, “Balance of Payments Developments and Statistics” heading
disseminated under “Publications/Periodic Publications” has been changed to “Balance of
Payments Statistics and International Investment Position” and divided into two sub-groups as
“Balance of Payments Statistics” and “International Investment Position”. Moreover,
methodological notes, Press Releases and Advance Release Calendars for balance of
payments statistics and international investment position are also added.
By the new arrangement made in this context, in addition to new tables, stock tables
previously disseminated monthly together with the balance of payments statistics will
continue to be disseminated under the heading “International Investment Position”.
Balance of payments statistics are disseminated on a monthly basis, and IIP is
disseminated on an annual basis. Starting from the end of June 2006, IIP will be published on
a quarterly basis.
