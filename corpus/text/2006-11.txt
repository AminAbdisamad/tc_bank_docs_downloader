PRESS RELEASE ABOUT TURKEY’S 
 BALANCE OF PAYMENTS STATISTICS AND  
 INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION 
 
 
The International Investment Position table (IIP), which reports the stocks of external 
financial assets and liabilities of Turkey at a ref erence date  is started to be disseminated in 
http://www.tcmb.gov.tr  internet address.  The conceptual framework, definitions and 
classification standards of the IIP are broadly con sistent with the International Monetary 
Fund’s fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Man ual.  
Within this framework, “Balance of Payments Develop ments and Statistics” heading 
disseminated under “Publications/Periodic Publicati ons” has been changed to “Balance of 
Payments Statistics and International Investment Po sition” and divided into two sub-groups as 
“Balance of Payments Statistics” and “International  Investment Position”. Moreover, 
methodological notes, Press Releases and Advance Re lease Calendars for balance of 
payments statistics and international investment po sition are also added. 
By the new arrangement made in this context, in add ition to new tables, stock tables 
previously disseminated monthly together with the b alance of payments statistics will 
continue to be disseminated under the heading “Inte rnational Investment Position”. 
Balance of payments statistics are disseminated on a monthly basis, and IIP is 
disseminated on an annual basis. Starting from the end of June 2006, IIP will be published on 
a quarterly basis.
