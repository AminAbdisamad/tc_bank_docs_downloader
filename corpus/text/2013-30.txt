PRESS RELEASE ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE SELLING AUCTIONS TO BE
HELD ON THE DAYS WITH REGULAR FUNDING

In line with the Monetary Policy Committee decision held on 18 June
2013, the composition of the liquidity provided by the Central Bank of the
Republic of Turkey will be gradually shifted from net foreign assets to net
domestic assets until the next Monetary Policy Committee meeting. To this
end, only one intraday foreign exchange selling auction will be held on the
days in which funding is provided from the policy rate within the limits set by
the Monetary Policy Committee.

Auction amount will be minimum USD 150 Million. Auction amount will
be posted on CBTQ at 15:00. Full amount of offers received will be met up to
the auctioned amount and the same guidelines stated for “Intraday Foreign
Exchange Selling Auctions in the CBRT’s Press Release” of 11 June 2013 will
apply.
