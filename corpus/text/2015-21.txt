The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has d ecided to keep the short term interest rates 
constant at the following levels: 
a)  Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 10.75 percent, the interest rate on borrowing 
facilities provided for primary dealers via repo tr ansactions at 10.25 percent, and borrowing rate 
at 7.25 percent, 
b)  One-week repo rate at 7.5 percent, 
c)  Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 
percent, and lending rate at 12.25 percent. 
Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in respo nse to the tight monetary policy stance and 
macroprudential measures. The favorable development s in the terms of trade and the moderate course 
of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. External demand 
remains weak, while domestic demand contributes to growth moderately. The Committee assesses that 
the implementation of the announced structural refo rms would contribute to the potential growth 
significantly. 
The ongoing cautious monetary policy along with pru dent fiscal and macroprudential policies are having  a 
favorable impact on inflation, especially inflation  excluding energy and food (core inflation indicato rs). 
Yet, uncertainty in global markets and elevated foo d prices necessitates maintaining the cautious stan ce 
in monetary policy. Accordingly, the Committee deci ded to keep the interest rates at current levels. 
Future monetary policy decisions will be conditiona l on the improvements in the inflation outlook. 
Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be monitored clo sely 
and the cautious monetary policy stance will be mai ntained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there  is a 
significant improvement in the inflation outlook. 
It should be emphasized that any new data or inform ation may lead the Committee to revise its stance. 
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meetin g will be released within five working days.
