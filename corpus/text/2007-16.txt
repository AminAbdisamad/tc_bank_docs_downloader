DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Meeting Date: July 12, 2007
Committee Members
Durmuş Yılmaz (Governor), Erdem Başçı, Burhan Göklemez, M. İbrahim Turhan,
Mehmet Yörükoğlu.

The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) decided to keep short-term
interest rates (policy rates) unchanged as follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 17.50 percent, and lending rate at
22.50 percent,
b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate applied between 4:00 p.m. –
5:00 p.m. at 13.50 percent, lending rate at 25.50 percent,
c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided
for primary dealers via repo transactions at 21.50 percent.
While the developments in energy and food prices, public expenditures, and
external demand since the last quarter of 2006 restrain the disinflation process, domestic
demand and inflation continue to decelerate owing to the lagged effects of strong
monetary tightening. These developments are broadly in line with the April Inflation
Report. Therefore, adhering to the outlook presented in the Report, the Committee
envisions a measured easing starting from the last quarter of 2007. The exact timing and
extent of the easing will depend on the incoming information regarding external demand,
public expenditures and other determinants of medium term inflation outlook.
Moreover, considering the current levels of liquidity, the Committee assessed that
the Central Bank Liquidity Billsin addition to the current tools used in open market
operations—could be used to enhance the effectiveness of liquidity management when
necessary.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation
outlook will lead the Committee to reconsider its stance.
Summary of the Monetary Committee Meeting will be released within eight working
days.
