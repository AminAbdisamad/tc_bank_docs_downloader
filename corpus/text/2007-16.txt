The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) decided  to keep short-term 
interest rates (policy rates) unchanged as follows: 
a)  Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 17.50  percent, and lending rate at 
22.50  percent, 
b)  Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate  applied between 4:00 p.m. – 
5:00 p.m. at 13.50  percent, lending rate at 25.50  percent, 
c)  The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity  borrowing facilities provided 
for primary dealers via repo transactions at 21.50  percent. 
 
While the developments in energy and food prices, publ ic expenditures, and 
external demand since the last quarter of 2006 restrain  the disinflation process, domestic 
demand and inflation continue to decelerate owing to the lagged effects of strong 
monetary tightening. These developments are broadly i n line with the April Inflation 
Report. Therefore, adhering to the outlook presented in the Report, the Committee 
envisions a measured easing starting from the last quarte r of 2007. The exact timing and 
extent of the easing will depend on the incoming info rmation regarding external demand, 
public expenditures and other determinants of medium t erm inflation outlook. 
Moreover, considering the current levels of liquidity, the Committee assessed that 
the Central Bank Liquidity Bills in addition to the current tools used in open market 
operations—could be used to enhance the effectiveness of li quidity management when 
necessary. 
It should be emphasized that any new data or informat ion related to the inflation 
outlook will lead the Committee to reconsider its stance.  
Summary of the Monetary Committee Meeting will be r eleased within eight working 
days.
