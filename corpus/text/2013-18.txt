PRESS RELEASE ON RESERVE REQUIREMENTS
With a view to supporting financial stability in light of the latest developments
in global markets, the reserve option coefficients (ROCs) for foreign exchange (FX)
reserves held for Turkish lira required reserves have been raised by 0.2 points for all
tranches except for the first tranche. Accordingly, the revised ROCs are as follows:

Banks have been consistently using the facility and the utilization ratio is 90.5
percent (54.3/60) for FX. At present, FX worth USD 32.7 billion is being held for
Turkish lira required reserves. Should the facility continue to be used at the same
level after the revisions, Central Bank FX reserves are expected to increase
approximately by USD 1.4 billion.
The revisions will be effective as of the calculation period dated 26 April 2013
and the maintenance period will begin on 10 May 2013.
