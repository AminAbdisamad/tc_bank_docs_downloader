PRESS RELEASE
ON THE CBRT INTEREST RATE CUTS

I- GENERAL ASSESSMENT
1.

Fiscal discipline and monetary discipline are the sine qua non

conditions for disinflation efforts. As stated in the press release titled “September
Inflation and Outlook” issued in early October, the atmosphere of confidence
achieved as a result of the positive perceptions of economic agents about the
sustainability of the economic program brought along stabilization in exchange
rates. Thus, the inflation continued the downward trend not only through the input
costs but also through the expectations. Moreover, the fact that the recovery in
demand is not yet at a level that would put burden on production potential is
another factor that backs up the downward trend in inflation. In September, annual
CPI and WPI inflations dropped to 23 percent and 19,1 percent, respectively. These
figures have strongly reinforced the perceptions that the inflation target for end2003 would be achieved.
2.

It is clear that the favorable trend in the inflation can only be

sustained by uninterrupted continuation of the fiscal discipline and the structural
reform process. Within this framework, the determination in pursuing a public
sector incomes policy, which is instrumental in inflationary dynamics, in line with
the 2004 inflation target, and the measures taken for preserving the budgetary
discipline for the rest of 2003 and also in 2004, are all supporting our view that the
Turkish economy will continue to move in the right path.
3.

On the other hand, in the absence of exogenous shocks, a failure in

achieving a satisfactory decline in inflation, despite the improvements in economic
fundamentals, can only be attributed to unfavorable expectations. Therefore,
matching the expected inflation rate with the targeted inflation rate is of utmost
importance. According to the results of the Expectations Survey for the first half of

October, the year-end inflation expectations have fallen to 19,8 percent, below
the year-end target of 20 percent, while the expectations for the next 12 months
have decreased to 16,5 percent. Considering that the year-end inflation target for
2004 has been set as 12 percent, it is obviously significant to see inflation
expectations coming closer to this target. It is also clear, however, that this
process needs to be accelerated even further. But this alone may not suffice. What
is more important is that, the improvement observed in inflation expectations
should also be reflected on the private sector wage and price setting policies and
on similar contracts for the next period.
