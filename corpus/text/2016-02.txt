PRESS RELEASE
9 January 2016

Press Release on the Coverage of Reserve Requirements
Development and investment banks’ borrower funds will be subject to reserve
requirements and reserve requirement ratios (RRRs) for these liabilities will be 11.5%
for Turkish lira and 13% for FX liabilities.
Additionally, it has been decided that deposits/participation funds obtained from
banks abroad will be subject to the RRRs of other liabilities except
deposits/participation funds, since these liabilities are regarded as non-core
liabilities.
These amendments will be effective as of the calculation date of 12 February 2016
and the corresponding maintenance period starting from 26 February 2016.
