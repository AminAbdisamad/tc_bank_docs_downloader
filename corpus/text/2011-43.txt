PRESS RELEASE ON REQUIRED RESERVES  
 
At its meetings of 23 August 2011 and 20 September 2011, the Monetary 
Policy Committee (the Committee) stated that given the uncertainties regarding 
the global economy, it was important to monitor all  developments closely, and to 
take the required policy measures in a timely manne r. In line with the remarks 
made at the Committee meeting of 20 September 2011 pertaining to recent data 
and news on the global economic activity, the requi red reserve ratios for certain 
Turkish lira liabilities are decided to be reduced with a view to meeting the TL 
liquidity requirement of the Turkish banking system  permanently and at a lower 
cost.     
The reductions were also designed to encourage the lengthening of the 
maturities of the Turkish lira liabilities other th an the deposit/participation funds 
(particularly those of TL-denominated bonds that st arted to be issued by banks) 
in order to reinforce financial stability in the me dium and long run. The current 
and new ratios of required reserves are as follows:   
 TL Liabilities Current 
Ratios 
(%) New 
Ratios 
(%) 
Demand deposits, notice deposits and private curren t 
accounts 16 16 
Deposits/participation accounts up to 1-month matur ity 
(including 1-month) 16 16 
Deposits/participation accounts up to 3-month matur ity 
(including 3-month) 13 12.5 
Deposits/participation accounts up to 6-month matur ity 
(including 6-month) 9 9 
Deposits/participation accounts up to 1-year maturi ty 6 6 
Deposits/participation accounts with 1-year and lon ger 
maturity and cumulative deposits/participation acco unts 5 5 
Other TL liabilities up to 1-year maturity (includi ng 1-year) 13 11 
Other TL liabilities up to 3-year maturity (includi ng 3-year) 13 8 
Other TL liabilities longer than 3-year maturity  1 3 5  
This revision will be effective as of the calculati on period dated 30 September 
2011 and required reserves calculated using the new  ratios will start to be maintained 
as of 14 October 2011. Thus, the currently availabl e data suggests that 
approximately 3.2 billion Turkish lira will be supp lied to the market and the weighted 
average TL required reserve ratio, which is 13.1 pe rcent will come down to 12.5 
percent.
