PRESS RELEASE ON REQUIRED RESERVES

At its meetings of 23 August 2011 and 20 September 2011, the Monetary
Policy Committee (the Committee) stated that given the uncertainties regarding
the global economy, it was important to monitor all developments closely, and to
take the required policy measures in a timely manner. In line with the remarks
made at the Committee meeting of 20 September 2011 pertaining to recent data
and news on the global economic activity, the required reserve ratios for certain
Turkish lira liabilities are decided to be reduced with a view to meeting the TL
liquidity requirement of the Turkish banking system permanently and at a lower
cost.
The reductions were also designed to encourage the lengthening of the
maturities of the Turkish lira liabilities other than the deposit/participation funds
(particularly those of TL-denominated bonds that started to be issued by banks)
in order to reinforce financial stability in the medium and long run. The current
and new ratios of required reserves are as follows:

Deposits/participation accounts up to 6-month maturity
(including 6-month)
Deposits/participation accounts up to 1-year maturity

This revision will be effective as of the calculation period dated 30 September
2011 and required reserves calculated using the new ratios will start to be maintained
as of 14 October 2011. Thus, the currently available data suggests that
approximately 3.2 billion Turkish lira will be supplied to the market and the weighted
average TL required reserve ratio, which is 13.1 percent will come down to 12.5
percent.
