March Inflation and Outlook  
 
 
I. GENERAL EVALUATION   
1. According to the indices with 2003 base year, the CPI rose by 0.26 percent and the PPI 
by 1.26 percent in March 2005. The annual rates of increase of the indices were 7.94 
percent and 11.33 percent, respectively. 
2. The special CPI aggregate (G), which excludes energy, alcoholic beverages, other goods 
and services with administered prices, indirect taxes and unprocessed food, decreased by 
0.38 percent in the January – March 2005 period. The rate of annual increase dropped to 
8.27 percent in March with a persistent declin e starting from October 2004 (Table 1, Figure 
1). A similar decline is observed in the annual rate of increase in other special CPI 
aggregates as well. 
3. The PPI excluding agriculture (industrial sector) rose by 1.39 percent. The determining 
factor in this increase was the 1.54 percent upsurge in the manufacturing industry. The 
annual increase in the PPI, excluding agriculture, is 12.78 percent (Table 1, Figure 1).

Developments in Consumer Prices  
 
4. The factors influencing the consumer price increase in March 2005 can be summarized as 
i) the course of oil prices, ii) rigidity in services inflation, and iii) delayed effects of the 
appreciation of the New Turkish Lira. 
5. In March 2005, the increase in natural gas, heating oil, petroleum, and diesel oil prices, 
resulting from the developments in international crude oil prices, became the determinant 
factor in inflation, reflecting on the housing and transportation group prices. Nevertheless, 
due to the timing of the rise in petroleum and diesel oil prices, the upward effects are most 
likely to be observed in the April inflation figures.  
6. Meanwhile, the continuing rigidity in services  prices is noticed. When compared to the 
previous month, the increase in prices of restaurant and hotel services was way above the 
average inflation level at 2.36 percent. The cumu lative increase of 5.19 percent in restaurant 
– hotel service prices, against the 0.83 percent in the CPI, in the first quarter of 2005, points 
to a probable high demand for these services. 
7. Moreover, prices in the health sector, which di splayed an increase in the first two months 
of the year, below the seasonal trend, as a re sult of the VAT discount, rose by 0.89 percent 
in March 2005. Even though it can be said that prices in the health sector are still in a 
process of seasonal adjustment, it is difficult to predict the course of prices in this sector for 
the upcoming period. Especially after the legal adjustments that have united different 
hospitals linked to various social security institutions under the same organization, the 
 2patterns of economic behavior in the public health sector and its repercussions on the private 
health sector are being closely monitored. 
8. Meanwhile, delayed effects of the appreciation of the New Turkish Lira on the prices of 
durable goods such as household applianc es, private transportation vehicles and 
entertainment-culture instruments were observed . Hence, the prices of household appliances 
and entertainment-culture groups, which include these items, declined. 
9. One of the sub-groups that restrained the incr ease of CPI in March is clothing-shoes, as 
it was in January and February. In the January-March period, the total decline in prices of 
the clothing-shoes group reached 14.55 percent. As of April, the beginning of the new 
season in the clothing sector, an upsurge is  expected in the prices of this group. 
10.  The decline in inflation measured by the special CPI aggregates (F) (the CPI excluding 
energy, alcoholic beverages, other goods and services with administered prices and indirect 
taxes) and (G) (the CPI excluding energy, alcoholic beverages, other goods and services with 
administered prices, indirect taxes and unpro cessed food) indices is remarkable (Figure 1 
and Figure 2).

 3Developments in Producer Prices 
 
 
11.  In March 2005, the PPI rose by 1.26 percent compared to the previous month. The 
increase mainly stemmed from the increase in the PPI excluding agriculture (1.39 percent). 
Under the index with 2003 base year, fluctuations in the prices of the agriculture sector were 
expected to ease with the utilization of geometric mean to calculate the prices in this sector. 
Hence, the historically high rates of increase in  agriculture prices during March, according to 
the indices with 1994 base year, was recorded as a mere 0.79 percent under the new indices 
in 2005. 
12.  Manufacturing industry prices, which have a significant share of the industrial sector, 
rose by 1.54 percent in March 2005. The rise in  manufacturing industry prices resulted from 
coke coal and refined oil products, whose prices increased by 11.81 percent due to changing 
circumstances in international oil prices in that period. The annual increase in the sector by 
43.24 percent, which was well above the rate of increase in the PPI, points to the negative 
effects of oil prices on inflation. Furthermore, the rising tendency in crude oil prices, a 
significant input in the manufacturing industry, is of great importance. If this increase in 
international crude oil prices persists, the ne gative effects on manufacturer prices might 
linger.  
13.  Moreover, limited increases in energy prices, another determinant of production costs, 
continued. In March 2005, energy (electricity, gas, and water) prices fell by 0.05 percent 
compared to the previous month. However, it sh ould be kept in mind that the sensitivity of 
natural gas and electricity prices to crude oil prices may lead to price adjustments in the said 
sectors in the coming period.  
14.  When March PPI realizations are analyzed in terms of sub-sectors, though there is no 
apparent change in input costs, price moveme nts in opposite directions are observed in 
some sectors, in consecutive months. For example, in the manufacturing industry, the 
increase in prices of tobacco products by 3.84 percent, which dropped by 22.70 percent in 
the previous month is quite remarkable. Furthermore, the prices of office supplies production 
fell by 12 percent in February 2005 and increased by 8.23 percent in March. This 
development indicates that the said price deve lopments mainly stem from adjustments made 
in the profit margin after tax increases rather than production costs. 
15.  The appreciation of the New Turkish lira in the first quarter restricted the pass-through 
effect of the increase in primary metal prices on the manufacturing industry. Hence, prices in 
the primary metal industry under the PPI fell by 0.64 percent in March 2005. As of the 
 4beginning of the year, the cumulative decrease in the prices in primary metal industry 
reached 3.16 percent. However, production costs in this sector might be negatively affected 
by world commodity prices, which may increase due to the raw material demands of 
industrializing economies such as China and India. 
16.  Finally, in March 2005, the PPI increased by 11.33 percent compared to the same month 
of the previous year. In the same period, the PPI, excluding agriculture, rose by 12.78 
percent, while agriculture prices increased by 6.45 percent.

 5II. OUTLOOK 
 
Inflation Developments 
17.  Inflation stayed on a downward track also in March. The cumulative inflation of the first 
quarter of 2005 being 0.83 percent, which is ev en lower than the inflation figure of March 
2004 for a single month, underlines the remarkab le decline in inflation. As of April 2005, 
year-end inflation expectations were realized at 0.5 points below the target. 
18.  In the first months of 2005, the favorable ou tlook especially for tradable goods prices 
continued and the rigidity in the growth rate of  the services sector prices eased compared to 
previous periods, despite the persistence of the earlier trend in rents and the restaurant-
hotel group. In order to be able to evaluate inflation developments accurately, the 
adjustment of the CPI trend for external variables can provide significant forward-looking 
information. This is because a sudden hike in  oil prices and unexpected developments in 
natural conditions or public price adjustme nts may lead to unforeseen fluctuations in 
inflation. Adjustment of the general price index for such factors bears much significance for 
the accurate setting of response timing of monetary policy through analyzing the main 
trends in inflation. Special CPI aggregates were derived to serve this purpose. The tendency 
displayed by the special CPI aggregates since October 2004 confirms the downward course 
of the main trend.  
19.  After going through a change in context and method of measurement, and owing 
especially to the fact that prices are calculated excluding taxes, the PPI became more 
susceptible to raw material prices and exchange rate developments. The most affected 
sector in this sense is petroleum products sector, which is subject to high special 
consumption taxes. In fact, the refinery output prices of petroleum products were observed 
to be the main determinant of the general PPI index in March; this may cause producer 
prices to display unforeseen fluctuations. Interp retation of these producer price fluctuations 
as “inflation fluctuations” would be a misint erpretation. It is obvious that for better 
evaluation of the medium-term inflation outlook, consumer prices should be in the forefront 
rather than producer prices. It should be em phasized once more that the word “inflation” 
should be used as a synonym of the increase in the consumer price index, which is an 
accurate indicator in terms of price stabilit y and purchasing power, and that a common 
language should be formed in the public in this  respect. At this point, it should also be 
remembered that inflation targets are expresse d with increases in the consumer price index, 
whereas producer prices are considered solely  with respect to the information they contain 
regarding inflation in the upcoming period and are not considered as targets by any means.  
 6 
Factors Affecting Inflation 
20.  Growth data pertaining to the fourth quarter of 2004 was announced. As suggested by 
the Central Bank, not only in its reports, but also in presentations from the second half of 
2004 onwards, acceleration in both economic growth and domestic demand slowed down. In 
the last quarter of 2004, the annual growth rates of private consumption and investment 
expenditures displayed a considerable decline co mpared to the first nine months of the year. 
Contrary to the developments in the first nine months of 2004, the contribution of private 
expenditures to economic growth remained below GDP growth. Furthermore, according to 
seasonally adjusted data, private consumption expenditures and total final domestic demand 
declined in the last quarter of 2004, compared to the previous quarter.  
21.  The composition of the developments in private consumption in the last quarter of 2004 
differs from developments in previous periods.  In the first nine months of 2004, growth 
mainly originated from durable consumption goods. The high levels of productivity increases 
achieved in these sectors, as well as the low costs of imported input items prevented the 
downward trend in inflation to be hampered by the demand side. Excluding the durable 
consumption goods sector, the revival in do mestic demand was very limited. However, 
recently announced data shows that expenditures on durable consumption goods declined in 
the last quarter of the year compared to the same period of the previous year, while 
expenditures on semi-durable consumption goods maintained their high level, despite the 
slowdown in their rate of growth compared to the previous period. Meanwhile, the high 
increase in public consumption expenditures in the last quarter of 2004 is a development 
which has captured attention. Although, these data show that the relative recovery in 
domestic demand has been spreading to sectors other than the consumption of durables, 
when the historical consumption levels are taken into account, no demand-side risk to 
inflation has yet been perceived in the short term. 
22.  Consumer confidence indices, imports of in termediate goods, automobile sales and other 
demand-related developments indicate that econom ic activity is likely to be more vigorous in 
the upcoming period compared to the last quarter of 2004, but more controlled compared to 
the first half of 2004. Hence, total demand is forecasted to follow a parallel course to 
program projections in 2005. The relative slowdown observed in comparison with the first 
half of 2004 should not be perceived as “stagnation”, but rather as a healthy development 
showing that long-term sustainable growth rates have been resumed. Undoubtedly, the 
adjustment process created by the rapid transformation of our economy is reflected in a 
different way in every sector. However, the point that should be underlined here is that the 
 7Turkish economy reached high growth rates in the last three years and that this growth 
process continues in 2005, as well. 
23.  In the last period, the ongoing decline in credit interest rates, the rise observed in the 
demand for money and the briskness in consumer credits point to a possible rebound in 
domestic demand from the second half of the year onwards. However, data available as of 
today does not allow for a clear-cut assessment. At this point, it should be stressed once 
again that maintaining the discipline in the fisc al and monetary policies is essential for the 
gains achieved in the fight against inflation to be lasting ones. 
24.  The Central Bank indicated in its “Inflation and Outlook” reports from the second half of 
2004 onwards that productivity increases would slow down and that rises in real wages 
might adopt a relative acceleration. In fact, the slowdown observed in productivity in the last 
quarter along with the upward trend in employment and real wages led to a rise in real unit 
wages in the private manufacturing industry for the first time since 1999. Considering the 
developments in the last four years, it is cl ear that productivity increases have kept labor 
costs under control and, to a large extent, acco unted for the historical decline in inflation. 
The current level of unit wages does not constitu te a significant risk to the 2005 inflation 
target. However, the slowdown or in some cases the decline recently observed in growth 
rates of productivity in some sub-sectors is a development that should be followed closely.  
25.  Projections about the output gap, which is one of the indicators of resource utilization in 
the economy and the pressures on inflation, show that the production level reached during 
the last quarter of 2004 does not create any pressure on inflation. Developments in 
machinery-equipment production and imports of investment goods as well as the business 
tendency survey data as of early-2005 indicate that investments continue, albeit at a slower 
pace compared to previous periods. Increased capacity owing to higher investment 
expenditures in recent periods, the contro lled increase of domestic demand and the 
continuing rise in investment expenditures rule out the possibility in the short run of a 
pressure on prices led by the supply-demand conditions.  
26.  To sum up, employment, productivity and wage developments pertaining to the last 
quarter of 2004 support our prediction that labor costs will not contribute to the disinflation 
process as much as they had done in the previous periods. Still, it is anticipated that 
investment expenditures, which recorded a hi gh rate of increase throughout 2004, will 
continue to foster productivity increases, particularly in technology intensive sectors. 
Meanwhile, taking into account the current unemployment rate and considering the 
likelihood that additions to the labor force originating from demographic factors will be high 
in the coming years, increases in average labor costs are projected to remain limited, under 
 8the assumption that the public wage policy will be consistent with inflation targets. At this 
point, however, it should be once again underlined that rapid removal of the barriers to 
investment and production and the development of corporate governance are of critical 
importance for the continuity of productivity increases. It should be kept in mind that the 
attainment of the historical disinflation proce ss and the concurrent high growth figures were 
possible owing to macroeconomic stability and high productivity increases. In order to 
establish macroeconomic stability permanently, a similar process needs to continue from now 
on as well. This in turn necessitates that the structural reforms of the last three years be 
broadened and continued.  
27.  Although there seem to be no significant risks to inflation in terms of the supply-demand 
conditions, developments in international liquidity  and oil prices, as well as the course of unit 
wages signal that costs will not make an extra contribution to the downward trend in 
inflation in the coming period, and that monthly inflation figures may be realized higher in 
the rest of 2005 compared to the first quarter of the year. The downward trend of the first 
quarter and the favorable course of expectations still render the 2005 inflation target 
attainable despite recent cost developments.  
28.  Recent exchange rate movements were sh aped to a large extent by international 
liquidity conditions and changes in global risk perception. In order to ensure that the effects 
of the said developments on the economy are temporary in the medium-term, the process of 
reinforcement in macroeconomic foundations must be sustained. For this reason, draft laws 
currently pending including those about social security, financial institutions and revenue 
administration are highly significant.  
29.  Recently, a lot of attention has been focused on the question regarding to what extent 
the exchange rate movements can affect inflation. It has been occasionally emphasized in 
previous reports that the relationship between exchange rate developments and inflation has 
weakened. Undoubtedly, the exchange rate will continue to be an important determinant of 
inflation in Turkey, a country on the path to becoming an increasingly open economy. 
However, there is a crucial point about exchange rate-inflation relation that should be 
clarified: In the floating exchange rate regi me, developments in exchange rate movements 
affect inflation as long as these movement s occur in the same direction for several 
consecutive months and are perceived as permanent. Hence, the effects of a sudden 
depreciation in the New Turkish lira following a sudden rise in inflation will remain limited to 
a certain extent. Therefore, the current level of  exchange rates does not constitute any risks 
to inflation.  
 
 9Monetary Policy 
30.  In typical monetary transmission mechanisms, the impact of interest rate changes on 
demand and the repercussions of demand move ments on inflation occur with a time lag. 
Although it may not be possible to say that the said transmission mechanisms started to 
operate properly in our country due to fiscal dominance, it is clear that we are on route to 
having a similar mechanism following the achievements attained in macroeconomic stability 
in recent years. These developments enable th e Central Bank to focus on future inflation 
rather than current inflation and to focus increasingly more attention on the medium-term. 
Needless to say, in line with the rapid transformation that our economy has undergone in its 
normalization process, monetary transmission  mechanisms will also be in a process of 
continuous change. The more macroeconomic stab ility is established, the more uncertainties 
in monetary transmission mechanisms will decrease. With the transition to the inflation-
targeting regime next year, the said me chanisms will become more significant.  
31.  In light of current data, the above-mentioned cost developments are estimated to lead 
to at least a small amount of increase in inflat ion figures in the upcoming period. However, it 
is anticipated that the said increase would not change the main inflation trend and inflation 
will re-enter a downward trend as soon as temporary conditions are removed. Considering 
the cost, production, demand, and productivity conditions, and in an overall scenario in 
which structural reforms would not lose pace and the economy would not be exposed to a 
great exogenous shock, 2005 inflation is expected to realize in line with the targets. In 
accordance with the above-mentioned analyses and taking into account the evaluations 
made at the Monetary Policy Board meeting held  on April 8, 2005, the Central Bank decided 
to cut the short-term interest rates applicable on the CBRT Interbank Money Market and 
Istanbul Stock Exchange Repo-Reverse Repo Mark et by 0.5 point to be effective as of April 
11, 2005. While the Central Bank is maintainin g its cautiously optimistic stance for 2005 
year-end inflation, it emphasizes that this cautious stance should also be sustained in the 
medium-term, considering the data pertaining to last month and the developments in the 
world. In this framework, besides structural  reforms the course of unit costs, domestic 
demand and international liquidity conditions will be closely monitored in terms of monetary 
policy decisions.
