SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 24 November 2015
Inflation Developments
1. In October, consumer prices increased by 1.55 percent, and annual inflation edged
down by 0.37 points to 7.58 percent. Annual food inflation declined on account of
the unprocessed food prices, while the annual energy inflation decreased due to the
base effect. Meanwhile, the depreciation in the Turkish lira pushed annual inflation in
core goods upwards. Annual services inflation, on the other hand, maintained its high
levels. Accordingly, annual inflation of core indicators and their seasonally adjusted
underlying trend registered increases.
2. Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages declined by around 2 points to
8.69 percent in October. This decline was led by annual unprocessed food inflation
that receded to 9.40 percent driven particularly by the prices of vegetables. On the
processed food front, the downward trend in annual inflation continued. Leading
indicators of November show that annual food inflation may increase due to the
unprocessed food prices. Energy prices went up by 0.77 percent while the annual
energy inflation decreased by around 1.8 points to 0.12 percent due to base effect in
October.
3. Prices of services rose by 0.71 percent in October, and annual services inflation
edged up by 0.11 points to 8.65 percent. Annual inflation decreased in the
restaurants-hotels group, remained flat in rent and increased in other services.
Meanwhile, prices of catering services maintained the upward trend and the annual
inflation in this group, with 14.87 percent, remained as the determinant of the high
course of prices of services. Against this background, the underlying trend of services
inflation exhibited an almost flat course in October maintaining its high level.
4. Annual core goods inflation rose by 1.25 points to 9.19 percent in October. The
cumulative depreciation in the Turkish lira pushed the prices of core goods by 1.75
percent on a monthly basis. Witnessing the exchange rate effects with a longer lag,
the annual inflation in core goods excluding clothing and durables reached 8.49
percent. Moreover, the clothing group recorded the highest October price increase of

the index history. Accordingly, seasonally-adjusted data showed a sustained increase
in the underlying trend of core goods inflation.
5. In sum, the Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) assessed that
developments in energy prices continue to affect inflation favorably, yet cumulative
effects of the exchange rate movements delay the improvement in the core inflation
trend.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6. After the sharp monthly increase in August, industrial production remained flat in
September, thus recording a quarterly growth of 1.1 percent in the third quarter. Due
to fewer working days in September, industrial production declined by a yearly 7.9
percent, yet it might pick up again year-on-year thanks to October’s increased
working days. The BTS data on production over the last three months and the PMI
indicators point to a moderate monthly growth for October. Industrial production has
become increasingly volatile due to bridge days and the changing number of working
days. Yet, seasonally and calendar adjusted three-month averages suggest that
production remains on the rise.
7. Data on the expenditure side suggest a more moderate demand outlook in the third
quarter relative to the first half of the year. The production and imports of
consumption goods declined in the third quarter. The retail sales volume index
slowed quarter-on-quarter, while non-food retail sales posted a quarterly contraction
in the third quarter. After a robust second-quarter, imports of investment goods
were down in the third quarter on a quarterly basis. Data on construction
employment and the production and imports of minerals indicate a stable pattern in
construction investments. All in all, domestic demand is likely to provide a modest
contribution to growth in the third quarter.
8. The non-gold exports volume index rose in the third quarter whereas the imports
index fell in line with moderate domestic demand. Therefore, the growth
composition appears to be shifting in favor of net exports thanks to the rising
demand from the EU countries. This composition change and the favorable
developments in the terms of trade along with the moderate course of consumer
loans support the improvement in the current account balance. Recent data indicate
a marked improvement in the seasonally adjusted current account balance. Thus, the
current account balance in annual terms is expected to improve further.
9. Among BTS indicators, export orders over the last three months have seen
expectations grow increasingly optimistic since early third quarter, while domestic
orders have recovered recently after the weak course of the first three quarters.
Moreover, the consumer confidence increased notably amid lessening domestic
uncertainty. Likewise, expectations for investment and employment continued to
improve. Against this background, confidence and revenue channels are expected to
boost domestic demand in the upcoming period.

10. Non-farm unemployment remained flat in August due to the falling labor force
participation, while non-farm employment decreased. By sectors, employment
picked up slightly in services and construction but declined in the industrial sector for
the third period in a row. Thus, the average annual non-farm employment growth
equaled 3 percent in the January-August period. Having trended upward for the first
three quarters, industrial production is expected to remain on the rise through the
rest of the year. Survey indicators for industrial employment also point to a recovery
in September and October. Accordingly, the fall in industrial employment is likely to
be temporary. Given the economic outlook, the modest growth in services and
construction employment is expected to continue.
11. To sum up, domestic demand appears to follow a more moderate course in the
second half of the year, while external demand makes an increased contribution to
growth. The recovery in European economy affects external demand positively,
whereas geopolitical tensions pose a downside risk to external demand. Meanwhile,
the reduced domestic uncertainty drives consumer confidence and expectations of
investment and employment higher, which are expected to help to support the
recovery of domestic demand over the upcoming period. Hence, aggregate demand
conditions are likely to provide further support for disinflation.
Monetary Policy and Risks
12. Annual loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary
policy stance and macroprudential measures. Yet, loan growth has seen some
deceleration recently. Specifically, commercial loans denominated in foreign currency
and consumer loans have lost significant momentum. The Committee expects loans
to return to the moderate growth path amid normalized financial conditions over the
upcoming period. With respect to the composition of loans, commercial loans
continue to grow faster than consumer loans. This composition not only limits
medium-term inflationary pressures, but also helps to improve the current account
balance.
13. Indicators for the second half of the year point to a moderate economic activity.
Industrial production continued to grow in the third quarter as well after the first half
of the year. In this period, the non-gold exports volume index increased whereas the
imports index fell. The rising demand in the European economy affects Turkey’s
exports positively while geopolitical developments put downward pressure on
external demand. Both the recent recovery of the confidence index and the
improving expectations for investment and employment are likely to bolster
domestic demand. Accordingly, the Committee assesses that the growth composition
has shifted in favor of net exports. In addition to this shift, the favorable
developments in the terms of trade and the sluggish course of consumer loans
contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. Given the recent
notable improvement in the seasonally-adjusted current account balance, the annual
current account deficit is expected to narrow further.

14. Energy price developments continue to affect inflation favorably. The negative
impact of cumulative exchange rate developments since the beginning of the year
on the inflation outlook is partly offset by lower oil prices. Food prices, on the other
hand, remain volatile mainly due to unprocessed food prices. The cumulative
Turkish lira depreciation caused the annual core goods inflation to rise and the core
inflation trend to deteriorate slightly. Thus, considering the impact of the global
market uncertainty on inflation expectations and the volatility in energy and
unprocessed food prices, the Committee stated that the tight liquidity stance will be
maintained as long as deemed necessary. Future monetary policy decisions will be
conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, the
pricing behavior and developments in other factors affecting inflation, the tight
monetary policy stance will be maintained.
15. Uncertainties surrounding global monetary policies and concerns over global growth
cause financial markets to remain volatile. Therefore, portfolio flows to emerging
economies follow a volatile pattern. Despite having improved somewhat recently,
risk premia and exchange rate volatilities remain high. The Committee stated that the
measures announced by the CBRT within the context of the “road map during the
normalization of global monetary policies” boost the resilience of the economy
against global shocks. The current monetary policy stance continues to be tight
against the inflation outlook, stabilizing for the FX liquidity, and supportive of
financial stability.
16. In case the decline in loan growth rates becomes permanent and exchange rates
continue to face upward pressure over the upcoming period, in addition to
preserving the tight monetary policy stance, the Committee may take measures to
support the Turkish lira and the loan growth by easing the conditions for the use of
foreign currency denominated collateral.
17. Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with
regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance
is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there
will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices. A revision of the monetary
policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from
this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term
inflation outlook.
18. Sustained fiscal discipline has become a fundamental element in reducing the
sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years. In the
current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the value added from
maintaining and further advancing these achievements is significant. Any measure
that would ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings
deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social
welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels.
