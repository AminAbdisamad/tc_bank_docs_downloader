SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 18 February 2014

Inflation Developments
1. In January, consumer prices increased by 1.98 percent, and annual inflation
reached 7.75 percent. Food prices, tax adjustments and exchange rate
movements were influential in this rise and core inflation indicators recorded
an increase due to core goods. Meanwhile, services inflation maintained its
relatively mild course.
2. Annual food group inflation climbed to 10.89 percent. In January, not only
fresh fruits and vegetables but also other products registered price hikes. This
resulted in increased annual unprocessed food inflation despite the high base
from the previous year. Meanwhile, upon price increases that spread across
the group, processed food prices were up by 1.42 percent and the group’s
annual inflation reached 8 percent.
3. In January, despite the fall in international oil prices, energy prices increased
owing to the rise in domestic fuel prices amid the depreciation of the Turkish
lira. Meanwhile, in the alcoholic beverages and tobacco products group, SCT
adjustments introduced pushed the tobacco products’ prices up by 7.4 percent.
4. Prices of services edged up by 0.93 percent, and the group’s annual inflation
maintained its level around 8 percent. Seasonally adjusted data pointed to a
limited rise in the underlying trend of services inflation in this period.
Meanwhile, annual core goods inflation increased by about 1 percentage
points to 7.12 percent. This was mainly driven by the surging prices of durable
goods on the reverberations of the depreciation in the Turkish lira besides the
raised SCT on automobiles. On the other hand, annual inflation in the clothing
group remained on a downward trend. Core goods prices accelerated as the
depreciation in the Turkish lira that started in mid-December has reflected on
prices since January.

5. In sum, The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) closely monitors the
recent deterioration in the inflation outlook and expectations. Inflation is likely
to hover above the 5-percent target for some time due to the recent tax
adjustments, exchange rate developments and the unfavorable course of food
prices.

Factors Affecting Inflation
6. Recent data suggest that final domestic demand continued to increase
moderately in the fourth quarter. Following the recent sharp fluctuations, the
industrial production index remained steady at its November level in
December. Yet, in quarterly terms, industrial production posted a modest
quarter-on-quarter increase in the fourth quarter, which is close to the average
growth rate seen since early 2012.
7. The moderate trend in private consumption demand continued in the last
quarter of the year. Production and imports of consumer goods were up
quarter-on-quarter compared to the previous quarter. Despite hovering slightly
below the averages of the previous quarter, sales of automobiles and white
goods remained elevated throughout the fourth quarter. Meanwhile,
investment demand was more favorable in the fourth quarter. Production of
capital goods grew moderately quarter-on-quarter in the final quarter. The
production of capital goods excluding vehicles, an indicator for the underlying
trend, recorded a larger growth than total capital goods. Similarly, imports of
capital goods increased as well.
8. Data suggest that exports maintained their modest growth trend in the fourth
quarter. In fact, the non-gold export volume index was up in the fourth quarter
from the third-quarter average. The global recovery and the robust
international import demand that PMI indicators point to have been effective in
this increase.
9. The increased domestic uncertainty has caused consumer confidence to
slump recently. Meanwhile, automobile sales also slowed dramatically in
January. Moreover, loans, particularly consumer loans, have been posting a
gradually slower rate of growth. On the other hand, despite some weakening,
the investment and employment sentiment in January’s Business Tendency
Survey (BTS) maintained their moderate levels, while the PMI new order and
production indices have no negative outlook. Against this background, the
Committee envisages that private domestic final demand may decelerate in
the first quarter of 2014.

10. Seasonally adjusted unemployment rates remained unchanged in November
2013. The rise in employment in this period came largely from the services
sector, while construction employment increased after a flat performance
throughout 2013 and industrial employment remained relatively weak. Leading
indicators show no signs of additional worsening for employment and point to
a moderate employment growth. In view of the expected slowdown in
domestic demand, unemployment appears to be on a slightly upward trend for
2014. A smaller-than-expected global economic recovery and domestic
uncertainties may remain constraint to investment and employment growth for
the upcoming period.
Monetary Policy and Risks
11. The Committee noted that credit growth has been slowing gradually due to
tight monetary policy, macroprudential measures and weak capital flows.
Particularly due to macroprudential measures, the growth of consumer loans is
expected to slow at a relatively faster pace. Moreover, it is assessed that the
recent uncertainty might cause private demand to weaken in the first quarter.
Data released for the first quarter of 2014 suggest that private domestic final
demand might decelerate.
12. Recent data indicate that exports continue to grow moderately and the nongold current account balance maintains its improvement trend. Thus, the
Committee stated that the recovering external demand and the slowing private
domestic final demand will help to increase the positive contribution from net
exports to growth over the year. This increase may also contain the negative
effects of the decelerating domestic final demand on growth. In addition, the
slowdown in consumer loan growth could particularly support the current
account rebalancing. Against this background, the Committee expects the
current account balance to display a significant improvement in 2014.
13. In the second half of 2013, with the high course of food prices and the external
uncertainties that led the Turkish lira to depreciate, inflation increased and
core inflation indicators and inflation expectations deteriorated. Recent and
lingering external uncertainties coupled with the elevated domestic
uncertainties caused additional exchange rate movements, which weighed on
the risk of inflation exceeding the target for a protracted period. Moreover, the
recent tax adjustments and the persisting unfavorable course of food prices
also exacerbated the deterioration in the inflation outlook.

14. The Committee closely monitors the recent deterioration in the inflation outlook
and expectations. It is envisaged that factors affecting inflation adversely will
keep inflation indicators considerably above the 5-percent target for a while.
Against this background, the Committee underlined that it will not tolerate any
deterioration in price stability in the medium-term. To this end, the Committee
opted for a strong and front-loaded monetary tightening in the interim meeting
of 28 January 2014 to prevent deterioration in the inflation expectation and the
pricing behavior. The Committee judges that the current policy stance will be
enough to anchor inflation expectations. The Committee indicated that tight
monetary policy stance will be sustained until there is a significant
improvement in the inflation outlook and that the liquidity policy may be
tightened further if deemed necessary.
15. The Committee monitors fiscal policy developments and tax adjustments
closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline
monetary policy stance takes the fiscal framework outlined in the Medium
Term Program as given. Accordingly, it is assumed that fiscal discipline will be
sustained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices. A
revision in the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal
stance deviate significantly from this framework and consequently have an
adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
16. Maintaining the cautious stance in fiscal and financial sector policies is critical
to the resilience of our economy against current uncertainties. Strengthening
structural reforms that will ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and
reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability in the medium
term. Steps taken in this regard will also provide more room for maneuvering
the monetary policy and improve social welfare by keeping interest rates of
long-term government securities permanently at low levels. In this respect,
implementation of the structural reforms required by the Medium Term
Program remains to be of utmost importance.
