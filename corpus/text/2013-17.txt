PRESS RELEASE ON OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS
Based on the projected Turkish lira liquidity needs, the Monetary Policy
Committee (MPC) decided, at its meeting of 16 April 2013, to set the amount of daily
funding via one-week quantity auctions between 0.2 and 6.5 billion Turkish liras until
the next MPC meeting to be held on 16 May 2013.
As for one-month repo auctions, the upper limit for each auction to be held
during the 17 April – 16 May 2013 period has been set as 1 billion Turkish liras.
In case of unexpected significant changes in liquidity conditions, the CBRT
may opt to provide funds outside the pre-announced limits.
