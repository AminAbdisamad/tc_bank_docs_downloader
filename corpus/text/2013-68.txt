In order to simplify the structure of reserve requi rements that are used as a 
monetary and macroprudential policy tool, a new app roach has been adopted. 
Accordingly, instead of deducting specified items f rom the total domestic liabilities, only 
the items subject to reserve requirements will dire ctly be taken into account while 
calculating liabilities subject to reserve requirem ents. Thus, immaterial items, which do 
not have a direct impact on the monetary policy but  reduce the efficiency of the 
operational processes, have been excluded from rese rve requirements coverage. 
With the revision, liabilities subject to reserve r equirements are redefined as 
follows: 
 a) Deposits/participation funds, 
 b) Funds from repo transactions, 
 c) Loans obtained (except the loans guaranteed by the Treasury), 
 d) Securities issued (net), 
 e) Subordinated debt (except the debts taken into account in the calculation of 
own funds), 
 f) Loans booked by foreign branches, 
 g) Deposits/participation funds of residents booke d by foreign branches, 
 h) Liabilities to the head office and branches abr oad (net) exceeding the amount 
of (f) and (g). 
 i) Debt from credit cards. 
With the revision, FX liquidity of approximately US D 1 billion is projected to be 
injected to the market. 
In  light of the latest developments in global mark ets and with a view to supporting 
financial stability by ensuring a more effective fu nctioning of the reserve options 
mechanism (ROM) working as an automatic stabilizer,  the reserve option coefficients 
(ROCs) for foreign exchange reserves held for Turki sh lira required reserves have been 
revised  as follows:

45-50 2.5 2.9

Banks have been consistently using the FX ROM facil ity; the utilization ratio is 
90.6 percent (54.3/60). The utilization ratio of th e facility is 46.3 percent (27.8/60) for 
financing companies that have been recently include d in the reserve requirements 
coverage. Currently, FX worth USD 33.7 billion is b eing held for Turkish lira required 
reserves, and the contribution of the revisions on the Central Bank reserves will depend 
on banks’ preferences.
