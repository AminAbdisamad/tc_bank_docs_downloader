Meeting Date: December 18, 2008
Committee Members

The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to lower the policy
rates as follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate is decreased from 16.25 percent to
15 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 18.75 percent to 17.50 percent,
b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate between 4:00 p.m. –
5:00 p.m. is decreased from 12.25 percent to 11 percent, while lending rate is
decreased from 21.75 percent to 20.50 percent,
c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities
provided for primary dealers via repo transactions is decreased from 17.75
percent to 16.50 percent.
Recent readings indicate that the slowdown in the domestic economic activity
has intensified. Ongoing problems in international credit markets and the global
economy are expected to continue to restrain both the domestic and external demand
for an extended period, putting downward pressure on inflation. Moreover, the
developments in oil and other commodity prices are having a favorable impact on
disinflation. Looking ahead, the Committee has judged that inflation will display a rapid
fall in the forthcoming period. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to lower shortterm interest rates by 125 basis points.
Uncertainties regarding the impact of the problems in financial markets on the
real economy remain at high levels. The Central Bank will continue to take the
necessary measures to contain the adverse effects of the global financial turmoil on the
domestic economy, provided that they do not conflict with the price stability objective.
The extent and the timing of the next rate cut will depend on the factors affecting
inflation outlook.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation
outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within
eight working days.
