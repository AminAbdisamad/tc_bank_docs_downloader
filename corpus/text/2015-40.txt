PRESS RELEASE

Press Release on the Maximum Interest Rates for Cre dit Cards in Q3 
2015  
The monthly maximum interest rates that banks can c harge on credit card borrowing in 
the third quarter of 2015 have been left unchanged.   
The CBRT sets maximum interest rates for credit car d borrowing under legal authority 
expressed most recently in the CBRT Communiqué No. 2014/5 on Maximum Interest Rates 
to be Applied to Credit Card Transactions published  in the Official Gazette No: 29153 dated 
22 October 2014. Accordingly, to be effective from 1 July 2015, for the credit card 
borrowings, the monthly maximum contractual interes t rate will be 2.02 percent for the 
Turkish lira and 1.62 percent for foreign exchange transactions, whereas the monthly 
maximum overdue interest rate will be 2.52 percent for the Turkish lira and 2.12 percent 
for foreign exchange transactions.  
Banks are not allowed to charge higher interest rat es than the rates announced by the 
CBRT for credit cards. Banks are free to determine their respective rates at their own 
discretion provided that they are below these ceili ngs. The maximum contractual and 
overdue interest rates for credit card transactions  for the three-month period starting on 1 
October 2015 will be announced by the CBRT prior to  that date.  
Banks in Turkey, as is the case in other countries,  charge higher interest rates for credit 
card borrowing than they do for consumer loans. The  CBRT therefore advises credit card 
holders with short-term credit needs to seek a cons umer loan rather than borrowing on 
personal credit cards.
