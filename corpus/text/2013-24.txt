PRESS RELEASE ON INTEREST RATES CHARGED ON 
OVERDRAFT ACCOUNTS   
 
Broadly speaking, the monetary transmission mechani sm works well in Turkey 
and hence global developments and the monetary poli cy currently implemented by 
the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) a re quite effective on the general 
level of interest rates. However, it is noteworthy that for the overdraft accounts, which 
are of similar nature to credit cards and which hav e reached an approximate balance 
of 10 billion Turkish liras after a recent surge in  volume, the interest rates charged by 
banks remain sticky at relatively high levels, in c omparison to interest rates charged 
on credit cards. 
Based on this observation, in order to strengthen t he monetary transmission 
mechanism and to address financial stability risks in this area, the CBRT identified 
a need for regulatory action in order to impose a c ap on the interest rates charged for 
overdraft accounts.  
In this regard, with the amendment to the CBRT Comm unique No. 2006/1, 
contractual and overdue interest rates on the overd raft accounts will be subject to the 
upper limits of contractual and overdue monthly int erest rates on credit card 
transactions. This regulation will be effective sta rting on Monday, May 27 2013.
