PRESS RELEASE ON INTEREST RATES CHARGED ON
OVERDRAFT ACCOUNTS

Broadly speaking, the monetary transmission mechanism works well in Turkey
and hence global developments and the monetary policy currently implemented by
the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) are quite effective on the general
level of interest rates. However, it is noteworthy that for the overdraft accounts, which
are of similar nature to credit cards and which have reached an approximate balance
of 10 billion Turkish liras after a recent surge in volume, the interest rates charged by
banks remain sticky at relatively high levels, in comparison to interest rates charged
on credit cards.
Based on this observation, in order to strengthen the monetary transmission
mechanism and to address financial stability risks in this area, the CBRT identified
a need for regulatory action in order to impose a cap on the interest rates charged for
overdraft accounts.
In this regard, with the amendment to the CBRT Communique No. 2006/1,
contractual and overdue interest rates on the overdraft accounts will be subject to the
upper limits of contractual and overdue monthly interest rates on credit card
transactions. This regulation will be effective starting on Monday, May 27 2013.
