DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Meeting Date: April 24, 2014
Participating Committee Members
Erdem Başçı (Governor), Ahmet Faruk Aysan, Murat Çetinkaya, Turalay Kenç, Necati Şahin,
Abdullah Yavaş, Mehmet Yörükoğlu.

The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term
interest rates as follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been kept at 12 percent, the
interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions
has been kept at 11.5 percent, and borrowing rate has been kept at 8 percent.
b) One-week repo rate has been kept at 10 percent.
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing
rate has been kept at 0 percent, while lending rate has been reduced from 15 percent to
13.5 percent.
The Committee assessed that the strong and frontloaded monetary tightening delivered
at the January interim meeting has contained the adverse impact of upside risks on the medium
term inflation expectations. Inflation expectations and pricing behavior will be closely monitored
and the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained until there is a significant improvement
in the inflation outlook.
Recent decline in uncertainties and partial improvement in the risk premium indicators
have reduced the need for an additional tightening in liquidity policy. Accordingly, the Committee
decided to deliver a technical cut in the late liquidity window lending interest rate.
Loan growth continues to slow down in response to the tight monetary policy stance and
recent macroprudential measures. In line with these developments, the data regarding the first
quarter of 2014 indicate some deceleration in private final domestic demand. Meanwhile, with
the help of the recovery in foreign demand, the contribution of net exports to economic growth is
expected to increase. The Committee expects that such a demand composition will support
disinflation and lead to a significant improvement in the current account deficit in 2014.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to
revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five
working days.
