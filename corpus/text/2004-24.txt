PRESS RELEASE  
ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE INTERVENTION  
OF THE CENTRAL BANK  
 
The Central Bank has announced through several press releases that, under the 
floating exchange rate regime, the level of exchange rate is determined by supply and 
demand conditions in the currency markets, the volatility in the exchange rate is closely observed by the Central Bank, and the Central Bank may directly intervene in the markets in the event of an excessive volatility that might occur in either directions.  
 Since the excessive volatility in exchange rates has recently been observed due 
to the reduced foreign exchange liquidity arising from the price volatility in foreign 
exchange assets of banks and the reverse currency substitution process, the Central 
Bank has directly intervened in the markets today by selling foreign currency. As was also the case in the previous buying or selling interventions, todayâ€™s intervention should not be interpreted as if the Central Bank were uneasy at the actual level of the Turkish lira.  
 Moreover, in relation to temporary foreign exchange liquidity needs mentioned 
above, the interest rate applicable to one-week maturity foreign exchange deposits 
provided for banks within their borrowing limits in the Foreign Exchange and 
Banknotes Markets operating at the Central Bank, has been cut to 6 percent from 10 percent starting from today.
