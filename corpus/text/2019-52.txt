CBRT has revised  FX reserve 
requirement practice and ratios  
28 December 2019, No. 2019 -52 
 
To support financial stability and  the real loan growth -linked reserve requirement practice, the 
CBRT has decided to:  
 
► increase reserve requirement ratios for FX deposits/participatio n funds by 200 basis 
points for all maturity brackets,  
► apply these ratios 200 basis points lower for banks that comply with the TL real loan 
growth conditions  to ensure that these banks are not affected by this increase.  
 
As a result of these revisions, approximately USD 2.9 billion of FX liquidity w ill be withdrawn from 
the market.  
 The revised ratios will be effective from the calculation period of 27 December 20 19 with the 
maintenance period starting on 10 January 2020.
