PRESS RELEASE ABOUT THE MAXIMUM INTEREST RATES TO BE APPLIED
FOR CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS

The monthly maximum contractual interest rate and the monthly maximum
default interest rate to be applied for credit card transactions in New Turkish Lira is
determined as 5,75 percent and 6,88 percent, respectively.
The monthly maximum contractual interest rates are determined as 5,75 percent for
New Turkish Lira, 2,68 percent for US dollar and 2,68 percent for Euro by the Communique
No: 2006/1 on Maximum Interest Rates To Be Applied For Credit Card Operations, published
in the Official Gazette dated April 2, 2006 and No: 26127. Similarly, the monthly maximum
default interest rates are determined as 6,88 percent for New Turkish Lira, 3,34 percent for
US dollar and 3,05 percent for Euro.
The interest rates stated above are maximum rates and banks will not be allowed to
apply interest rates higher than these rates beginning from June 1, 2006. Banks can freely
determine their interest rates provided that they do not surpass these ceiling rates.
According to the third provisional article of Bank Cards and Credit Cards Law,
institutions that issue cards should make necessary adjustment in their interest rate
calculations within three months in accordance with the provision of this Law. For this
reason, banks are obliged to adjust their credit card interest rates in accordance with the
maximum interest rates mentioned above, beginning from June 1, 2006. In other words, the
maximum interest rates announced by Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) today
will be effective between June 1, 2006 and July 2, 2006. Before July 2, 2006, the CBRT will
announce the maximum interest rates to be effective for the subsequent 3-month period.
Credit card, in general, is a payment instrument that enables its owner to purchase
goods and services at the member businesses without using cash. Moreover, if the credit card
users wish to withdraw cash or to delay their credit card spending for a determined period, the
relevant spending amounts turn into credit and thus credit card becomes a credit instrument.
Institutions issuing credit cards undertake POS (Point of Sale) machines investment cost and
membership cost to national and international payment systems, and they are exposed to
additional liquidity risk due to unforeseen cash withdrawals.

In that regard, banks tend to determine higher credit card interest rates than those of
consumer credits due to higher credit risk because of weak collateral structure and liquidity
risk because of unforeseen cash withdrawals. A survey of country practices also reveals that
credit card interest rates are determined higher than the interest rates set for consumer credits.
However, it is observed that the difference between these rates is much narrower than it is in
our country.
For instance, in the USA, the average yearly interest rates applied on consumer credits
is 7,5 percent, while the average yearly interest rate applied on credit cards is 12,5 percent. In
England, these rates are 14,2 percent and 16,5 percent; 12 percent and 16,8 percent in
Australia; and 13,7 percent and 18,8 percent in New Zealand. However, these rates are 22,6
percent (as of January 2006) and 84,8 percent (as of February 2006) in Turkey.
The primary reason of the wider gap in the interest rates between credit card and
consumer credit in our country compared to the other countries was the market expectations
of a new regulation concerning credit cards beginning from 2005 and the fact that the content
of such regulation could not have been foreseen exactly. Moreover, it is considered that the
provision of the Consumer Protection Law No: 4077 stating that default interest rate cannot
exceed the contractual interest rate by more than thirty percent, would be another reason.
This close connection has given rise to the determination of higher contractual interest rates to
enable banks to keep the default interest rates higher in an environment where banks can
freely determine contractual interest rates.
To prevent this inconvenience, by the Bank Cards And Credit Cards Law No:5464,
which became effective on 1 March 2006 it is enacted that the regulation which set the
connection between contractual interest rate and default interest rate in the Consumer
Protection Law No: 4077 shall not be applied for credit cards. On the other hand, the 26

th

Article of the Bank Cards And Credit Cards Law gives the Central Bank of the Republic of
Turkey the duty of determining the maximum contractual and maximum default interest rates.
In addition, the same Law has clearly specified the rights and responsibilities of the related
parties to a credit card transaction and regulated the infrastructure and operation of the
system.
The legal grounds of the above mentioned Article 26 draw attention to the fact that
there are wide gaps among the credit card interest rates applied by banks and moreover, some
banks apply interest rates above the sector average. The duty entrusted to our Bank by this
Law is to prevent the application of interest rates higher than the sector average, to closely
monitor the developments in the credit card market with a view to the financial stability

objective and to ensure the stabilization of the credit card interest rates based on market
dynamics, rather than intervening directly to interest rates, which is contrary to the free
market principles.
Country practices show that in general, the credit interest rates are freely determined
in the market. However, some countries may impose ceilings on the interest rates to prevent
excessively high interest rates within the framework of consumer protection.
In the French case, it is forbidden by law to implement an interest rate exceeding the
sector average by more than

thirty three percent. Banque de France makes public the

excessive interest rates calculated on a quarterly basis. A similar regulation also exists in Italy
and the interest rates to be applied by a bank cannot exceed the average interest rates
calculated by the Ministry of Economy by more than fifty percent, after taking the opinion of
the Banca d’Italia.
Our Bank has set the monthly maximum interest rates on credit cards by adding 0,5
point market margin to the weighted average interest rates of the banking sector. The same
method has been used for determining the maximum default interest rates.
The monthly maximum contractual interest rates applied by banks for their credit card
transactions differ between 2,75 percent and 6,5 percent. Therefore, the credit card holders
can enjoy a broad spectrum of interest rate alternatives and can freely decide which one to
choose. In the coming days, the monthly maximum interest rates applied by banks will be
published in our Bank’s web site and will be updated regularly if any changes occur. Thus,
the credit card holders will be able to choose the banks that apply lower interest rates by
checking these interest rates. It is expected that, the preferences of credit card users towards
the banks offering lower interest rates are likely to increase the competition in the banking
sector and hence to decrease the credit card interest rates. In this regard, it is predicted that the
interest rates applicable to credit cards will decline even further in the coming period, by way
of competition.
