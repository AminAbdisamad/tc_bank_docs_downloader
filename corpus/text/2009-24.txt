The Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) has been implementing  an inflation 
targeting regime since the beginning of 2006. This reg ime establishes a framework 
under which the CBT is accountable for achieving its main  goal of price stability, and 
for the policies implemented to pursue this goal. Withi n this framework, as stipulated 
by Article 42 of the Law, the accountability process is tr iggered when there is a 
significant deviation or potential deviation from the  established inflation targets. 
The inflation target for end-2009 was jointly set wit h the Government at 7.5 
percent. Consistent with the principle of accountability,  the CBT policy statement 
issued on December 16, 2009 entitled “Monetary and Exch ange Rate Policy in 
2009,” disclosed a quarterly path consistent with the end -2009 target along with 
uncertainty bands. In this context, it was stated that th e CBT, in the case inflation 
falls outside the band within that year , would explain through the Inflation Report  the 
reasons for the breach, and the measures that would be t aken to ensure that 
inflation would revert to the pre-established targets.  Should inflation fall outside the 
uncertainty band at the end of the year , the CBT would write an open letter to the 
Government . 
The inflation outturn as of June 2009 was 5.73 percent,  breaching the lower 
limit of the uncertainty band, which was set at 6.8 per cent for mid-2009. Accordingly, 
attached, for your consideration, is the latest Inflatio n Report issued on July 29, 
2009, which explains the reasons for the breach of the t arget, and the strategy 
adopted by the CBT to bring inflation back in line wi th the medium-term targets. 
 
Yours Sincerely,
