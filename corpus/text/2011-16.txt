SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: May 25, 2011

Inflation Developments
1. In April, consumer prices increased by 0.87 percent, and annual inflation rose
to 4.26 percent. This increase in annual inflation reflects the lagged effects of
import prices and the base effect from communication services. Therefore,
core inflation indicators remained on the rise as expected.
2. Unprocessed food prices continued to support disinflation in April. Annual
unprocessed food inflation fell to -0.83 percent in April from as high as 31.28
percent in October 2010. Meanwhile, annual processed food inflation
remained flat. Thus, annual food inflation continued to fall in April, hitting an
all-time low of 2.83 percent. However, rising fruit prices and base effects may
put significant upward pressure on May's food inflation.
3. Energy prices continued to rise amid high international oil prices, bringing
annual energy inflation up to 7.79 percent. Cumulative increases in oil prices
are expected to pass-through other energy items over the second half of this
year.
4. Services inflation remained moderate in April. Yet, as stated in the monthly
price bulletin for March, annual services inflation increased due to base effects
from communication services. Transport prices continued to rise slightly amid
higher fuel prices, while the annual rate of increase in restaurants and hotels
declined further, by a total of 2.5 percentage points in the first four months.
Thus, services inflation continued to slow in seasonally adjusted terms.
5. Annual core goods (excluding food, energy, alcoholic beverages, tobacco and
gold) inflation continues to surge on rising prices of imported goods. Among
durable goods, prices of white goods increased at a slower rate, whereas
furniture and automobile prices rose sharply.

Factors Affecting Inflation
6. Recent data releases on economic activity are consistent with the outlook
presented in the Inflation Report. Despite slowing quarter-on-quarter, industrial
production remained robust in the first quarter of 2011. Recent capacity and
production indicators also point to a slowdown in second-quarter economic
activity.
7. Private consumption and investment growth rates are moderating after a
strong rebound in 2010. Production and imports data for consumption and
investment goods confirm the first quarter's strong domestic demand.
However, leading indicators for the second quarter such as domestic sales of
automobiles, commercial vehicles and white goods as well as consumption
indices are down quarter-on-quarter. Moreover, expectations for domestic
orders also signal a slowdown in domestic demand.
8. External demand outlook remains weak. While the first quarter's non-gold
export quantity index was slightly lower than the fourth-quarter average,
leading indicators point to a moderate recovery in exports for the second
quarter. Consideringthe recently mounting uncertainty about the global
economy, the Committee has emphasized that downside risks to external
demand remain. In this regard, the Committee has reiterated that exports
would recover slowly and gradually.
9. Employment conditions continue to improve and unemployment rates are
approaching the pre-crisis levels. Employment grew at a stronger-thanexpected pace in the first quarter. Leading indicators suggest that this uptrend
would continue in the short term, albeit at a slower rate. The Committee has
stated that the improved employment conditions support domestic demand,
but have yet to exert upward pressure on unit labor costs.
Monetary Policy and the Risks
10. The Committee members drew attention to capacity utilization rates in the
manufacturing industry which have remained at low levels and stated that total
demand outlook has not reached levels to put upward pressure on inflation.
Benign course of services inflation supports the case against overheating.
However, owing to the lagged impact of cumulative rising import prices,
moderate increase in core inflation is expected to continue over the short term.
11. The Committee members reiterated that last year’s sharp fluctuations in food
prices will lead to a volatility in headline inflation in the period ahead. In this
respect, the Committee noted that inflation may exceed the year-end target of
5.5 percent in May due to base effects arising from unprocessed food prices,

and follow a volatile course thereafter in line with the path presented in the
Inflation Report.
12. The effects of the tightening measures on credit growth and domestic demand
have become visible in the second quarter. Recent data suggest that the pace
of credit growth has been moderating. Moreover, non-energy imports, which
displayed a strong print in the first quarter, are expected to follow a more
benign path starting with the second quarter. Moreover, orders and sales data
along with confidence indicators also signal some slowdown in domestic
demand growth.
13. Despite the slowdown in domestic demand growth, developments in external
demand and energy prices since the beginning of the year have been
postponing the improvement in the current account. Political uncertainties in
the North Africa have not only led to higher import bill through elevated energy
prices,but also restrained the recovery in exports. Moreover, heightened
concerns regarding debt sustainability in some euro area countries have
increased the downside risks for the European economy—our major trading
partner. Overall, the Committee indicated that both elevated levels of energy
and other commodity prices and a weaker external demand outlook postpone
the improvement in the current account balance to the last quarter.
14. In light of these assessments, considering the uncertainty regarding the global
economy, the Committee has indicated that it would be useful to continue to
observe the lagged impacts of the measures taken so far.
15. According to the Committee members, it would be appropriate to remain
flexible regarding the exact content of the policy mix, given the high level of
uncertainty arising from the global economic conditions. In this respect, it was
stated that the risk scenarios outlined in the Inflation Report continue to be
relevant. Therefore, in order to contain the risks towards price stability and
financial stability, the Committee has decided to monitor the tightening impact
of the existing policy mix and take additional measures along the same lines, if
needed.
16. The meeting also included an evaluation of the course of capital inflows and
foreign exchange purchase auctions. The Committee members highlighted the
relative weakness in capital flows to emerging markets due to heightened
concerns regarding debt sustainability problems in some euroarea countries,
and stated that it might be useful to revise the amount purchased via daily
auctions. It was indicated that the auction amount could be reduced gradually
should the weakening in capital flows persist, which, in turn, could ease the
need for further hikes in reserve requirements by reducing the liquidity injected
to the market through foreign exchange purchases. Similarly, measures to be
taken in the forthcoming period by other institutions in collaboration with the

Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) would also reduce the need for additional hikes
in reserve requirement ratios.
17. The CBT will continue to monitor fiscal policy developments closely while
formulating monetary policy. Increasing government saving—thus sustaining
fiscal discipline—under current circumstances is essential to control the
current account deficit driven by the disparity between domestic and external
demand. Therefore saving the extra tax revenues driven by the stronger-thanexpected economic activity would not only reduce financial stability risks, but
also increase the efficiency of the new policy mix.
18. Monetary policy will continue to focus on price stability while preserving
financial stability as a supplementary objective. To this end, the impact of the
macroprudential measures taken by the CBT and other institutions on the
inflation outlook will be assessed carefully. Strengthening the commitment to
fiscal discipline and the structural reform agenda in the medium term would
support the improvement of Turkey’s sovereign risk, and thus facilitate
macroeconomic and price stability. Sustaining the fiscal discipline will also
provide more flexibility for monetary policy and support the social welfare by
keeping interest rates permanently at low levels. In this respect, timely
implementation of the structural reforms envisaged by the Medium Term
Program and the European Union accession process remains to be of utmost
importance.
