PRESS RELEASE ON THE MAXIMUM INTEREST RATES TO BE A PPLIED TO 
CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS 
 
The maximum interest rates to be applied to credit card transactions 
have not been changed.  
The monthly maximum contractual and overdue interes t rates to be applied to 
credit card transactions, which were set with the C BRT Communiqué No. 2013/11 on 
the Amendment to the Communiqué No: 2006/1 on Maxim um Interest Rates To Be 
Applied To Credit Card Transactions published in th e Official Gazette No: 28765 
dated 14 September 2013 and which took effect as of  1 October 2013, are left 
unchanged. The rates will continue to be valid for the 3-month period starting on 1 
April 2014.  
Accordingly, the monthly maximum contractual intere st rate to be applied to 
credit card transactions during the period between 1 April 2014 – 30 June 2014 is 
2.02 percent for the Turkish lira, 1.70 percent for  the US dollar and 1.64 percent for 
the Euro, whereas the monthly maximum overdue inter est rate is 2.52 percent for the 
Turkish lira, 2.20 percent for the US dollar and 2. 14 percent for the Euro.  
As of 1 April 2014, the contractual and overdue int erest rates to be applied by 
banks to credit card transactions will not exceed t he above-mentioned maximum 
rates. Banks are free to determine their respective  rates at their own discretion 
provided that they are below the ceiling rates. The  maximum contractual and overdue 
interest rates, which will be valid for the 3-month  period starting on 1 July 2014, will 
be announced by the CBRT prior to this date.  
Banks in Turkey, as is the case with the banks in o ther countries, set the credit 
card interest rates higher than those on consumer l oans. Therefore, the CBRT 
advises credit card holders to prefer consumer loan s rather than personal credit 
cards to meet their short-term credit needs.
