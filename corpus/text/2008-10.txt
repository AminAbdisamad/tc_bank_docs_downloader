The Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) has been implementing a formal inflationtargeting regime since the beginning of 2006. Central Bank Law, as stipulated in the
Article 42, requires the CBT to be accountable for the non-fulfillment of inflation
targets. Inflation target for end-year 2008 was jointly set with the Government as 4
percent. To facilitate the accountability principle, our policy statement titled
“Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy in 2008” disclosed a quarterly path consistent
with the end-year 2008 targets along with an uncertainty band. In this context, any
breach of upper or lower limits of the band requires the CBT to write an open letter
to the Government, explaining the reasons for the breach and the measures to be
taken to ensure that inflation rate will return to levels within pre-established limits.
Inflation outturn as of March 2008 was 9.15 percent, breaching the upper limit
of the uncertainty band, which was set at 9.1 percent for the end of the first quarter
(Figure 1). Accordingly, this open letter explains the reasons for this breach,
presents the measures we have taken, and puts forth our monetary policy strategy
for the forthcoming period. This Open Letter will also be presented to the IMF as part
of the program conditionality.

Reasons For Breaching the Target
The monetary tightening exercised since mid-2006 has been successful in
leading to a significant reduction in underlying inflation. The fall in headline inflation,
however, was more limited, owing mainly to factors largely beyond the control of
monetary policy, such as developments in food, energy, and administered prices.
Prolonged increases in food and energy prices have recently led to upward
pressure on headline inflation and in turn to upward revisions in inflation forecasts in
many countries across the world. Turkey is not an exception in this regard, as
deviations of inflation from our forecasts can be mostly attributed to these factors.
For instance, our forecasts in October 2006 Inflation Report suggested that inflation
would converge to the 4 percent target at the end of the first quarter of 2008. The
forecast was based on a scenario where food inflation moderated to levels
comparable with medium term targets and oil prices remained stable at 60 USD per
barrel. However, oil prices continued to rise and averaged around 100 USD per
barrel in the first quarter of 2008. Moreover, annual food price inflation has
continued to remain at elevated levels, reaching 13.4 percent in March. As a
consequence 6.13 percentage points of the 9.15 percent annual CPI inflation in
March resulted from the food and energy items (Figure 2).

Both domestic and international developments have played a part on the
course of food prices. A prolonged shortage of rainfall in Turkey resulted in low crop
yields in 2007, which in turn translated to an adverse supply shock. Strong global
demand for food and continued elevation in agricultural commodity prices further
added to the domestic food inflation through the external trade channel. Recently,
adverse impacts of these factors have been quite visible especially in processed

food prices. Accordingly, annual food inflation maintained its high levels with a
marked contribution of about 2.3 points to the 3.1 percent year-to-date headline
inflation. Therefore, food prices became the main factor impeding the disinflation
process (Figure 3, Table 1).
Adverse developments in energy prices have been another major factor in
slowing the disinflation process. Rising oil prices continued to lead to significant
hikes in the prices of fuel-oil products. Elevated oil prices also affected the prices of
energy items in the housing utilities, including electricity tariff rates, which were
adjusted upwards by a significant margin. Consequently, contribution of energy
items to year-to-date CPI inflation reached to about 0.9 percentage points.

The decline in services inflation came to a halt in the first quarter of 2008.
Elevated food and energy prices have been exerting upward pressures on the prices
of catering and transport services. Rents and other services, on the other hand,
continued to decelerate.

Global uncertainties and their reflections on the domestic financial markets
have led to exchange rate movements, which in turn affected March inflation
especially through the prices of fuel and high-tech consumer durables. First round
effects of exchange rate pass-through are expected to continue in the short term.
Inflation in CPI excluding food, energy and tobacco items remained flat over
the previous quarter and remained at 4.8 percent, confirming that the rise in inflation
can be mostly attributed to factors beyond the control of the monetary policy.

As noted above, inflation has recently been rising all over the world (Figure 6).
Elevated prices of crude oil, agricultural products and other commodities have
continued to exert inflationary pressures. Inflation in developed economies edged up
in the last quarter of 2007 while emerging economies under inflation targeting have
been facing an upward trend since June 2007. Annual inflation in Turkey by the end
of the first quarter was 9.2 percent, which is below its end-2006 level of 9.7 percent.
During the same period, average inflation in emerging market economies under
inflation targeting rose from 3.4 percent to 6 percent.

Reaction of Monetary Policy
The CBT has been clear about its approach in responding to inflation resulting
from factors beyond its control: Monetary policy will tolerate the first round effects,
but will promptly respond to any deterioration in the overall pricing behavior. The
policy pursued since September 2007 should be interpreted in this context.
In September 2007, Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to initiate the
rate cuts, which had already been signaled earlier in the year. Accordingly, policy
rates were lowered by 225 basis points between September 2007 and February
2008 (Table 2).

In the January 2008 Open Letter, we indicated that uncertainties in the global
economy, hikes in electricity prices, and the risks to price setting behavior compelled
the CBT to be more responsive to the incoming information. The letter also
expressed that further monetary accommodation would depend on the factors
affecting medium term inflation outlook. Food and energy prices and global
uncertainties have continued to rise since then, feeding into the inflation
expectations and core prices and thus increasing the risks regarding the price
setting behavior and the degree of inflation persistence. Consequently, the MPC
decided to suspend the rate cuts in the March meeting and announced a clear
tightening bias going forward in the April meeting.
Inflation Outlook
Current supply and demand conditions support the downward trend in inflation.
Data on consumer credits suggest that monetary conditions continue to be nonaccommodative. Annual growth rates in the automobile and housing loans are at
lower levels compared to the periods of vigorous domestic demand (Figure 7).
Although consumer credits displayed signs of recovery in 2007, the cautious
monetary policy stance and the tightening in global credit conditions are likely to
restrain credit expansion in the forthcoming period.

The sharp slowdown in the second half of 2006 created a slack in the
economy. The recent methodological change in national accounts led to a limited
upward revision in our output gap measure and hence did not change the inflation
outlook. Looking ahead, we expect a continued moderation in economic activity and
non-farm employment on the back of rising precautionary saving due to global and
domestic uncertainties (Figure 8).

Accordingly, demand and capacity conditions are expected to continue to
support the disinflation (Figure 9). Therefore, assuming that supply shocks gradually
fade out over time, headline inflation is expected to decelerate.

The domestic currency has depreciated by more than 15 percent in nominal
terms since the beginning of the year (Figure 10). Notwithstanding the expected
deceleration in the core inflation indicators in the medium term, the first round
impacts of the exchange rate pass-through may be significant in the short term.

Longer term interest rates have increased lately due to rising risk premium
(Figure 11). Although higher interest rates contain the domestic demand and thus
support disinflation, the impact of the higher risk premium on the pricing behavior
should be closely monitored.

The CBT survey of expectations suggests that economic agents expect
inflation to pursue a downward trend. One year forward expectations are at 7
percent, whereas 2-year ahead inflation expectations stand at around 6 percent.
However, the recent upward movement in expectations has increased the risks to
the price setting behavior (Figure 12).

Our revised forecasts for medium term inflation incorporate more conservative
assumptions on food prices compared to January Inflation Report, which envisaged
a correction in food inflation justified by more favorable weather conditions.
However, the long-awaited correction in food prices has not materialized yet.
Processed food inflation accelerated even further on the back of rising global
demand and elevated agricultural commodity prices. Against this backdrop, we have
raised our assumptions for food inflation to 13 percent for the year 2008 and 8
percent for the year 2009. These changes have led to upward revisions in our
inflation forecasts, by about 1.2 points for 2008 and 1.1 points for 2009.

9

Central Bank of Turkey

The assumption on oil prices in the January Inflation Report stood at 85 USD
per barrel. However, oil prices averaged about 100 USD in the first quarter of 2008.
Considering the most recent developments, we have revised our assumption for oil
prices to 105 USD per barrel. Moreover, we assume that electricity tariffs will be
adjusted as needed by the automatic pricing mechanism. These changes imply
upward revisions in our forecasts by 0.9 points for end-2008, and 0.4 points for end2009.
Although weak domestic demand should limit the second round effects of the
exchange rate pass-through, the first round impact of the recent depreciation is
estimated to be close to 2-percentage points at the end of 2008, which implies
further upward revision in our forecasts.
Accordingly, we now forecast inflation to be around 9.3 percent at the end of
2008. Our medium term forecasts suggest, with 70 percent probability that, under
the assumption of a measured and gradual tightening towards mid-2008 and
constant policy rates thereafter for the rest of 2008, inflation will be between 4.9 and
8.5 percent (mid point 6.7) at the end of 2009 (Figure7). Assuming a gradual
moderation in food inflation, headline inflation is expected to decelerate to 4.9
percent at the end of 2010 and to 4 percent by mid-2011. We expect non-food
inflation to be lower than these figures.

* The shaded region indicates the 70 percent confidence interval for the forecast.

To sum up, supply shocks have turned out to be more persistent than
expected, increasing the risks to the second round effects and necessitating a
significant upward revision in our inflation forecasts. Accordingly, monetary policy
has already assumed a more cautious stance in order to eliminate the
materialization of potential second round effects. Ensuring a steady decline in
inflation will likely require tight monetary policy to be maintained for an extended

10

Central Bank of Turkey

period. Even then, the earliest time for reaching the 4 percent medium term targets
is likely to extend beyond two years.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information on the inflation
outlook may lead to a change in our policy stance. Therefore, the path for the policy
rates indicated above should not be perceived as a commitment on behalf of the
CBT.
Revised projections suggest that the contribution of energy, food and services
will be close to 5 percent at the end of 2009. In other words, assuming no further
hikes in administered prices (except the ones implied by automatic pricing
mechanisms), meeting the 4 percent target at the end of 2009 would be possible
only if the prices of goods excluding food, energy and tobacco deflate by 3 percent.
However, factors such as rising import prices, potential second round impacts of the
supply shocks, and the structural inertia in inflation could continue to impose
downward stickiness in goods prices. Therefore, converging to the medium term
target of 4 percent may extend beyond two years, even when tight monetary policy
is maintained for an extended period.
Under these circumstances, getting inflation back to the 4 percent by the end
of 2009 would require offsetting the first round effects, and thus create undesired
fluctuations in the economic activity and relative prices. That is why we envisage a
framework in which inflation remains higher than 4 percent at the end of 2009.
The forecasts presented above deserve particular attention, given that inflation
is likely to stay above the target in the next two years. The forecasts should serve as
anchors for the intermediate term, representing the inflation path that is likely to be
followed on the way to 4 percent medium term target.
Risks
Our revised forecasts are based on quite conservative assumptions, especially
on food and energy prices, implying that downside risks are as significant as upside
risks. April Inflation Report provides projections under alternative scenarios for food
and energy prices. The pessimistic scenario assumes food inflation to materialize at
17, 11 and 10 percent in the next three years, and oil prices to soar to 150 USD per
barrel at the end of 2009. Under this scenario, assuming that policy rates increase
gradually throughout the year 2008 and then stay constant for while, it takes four
years for inflation to go back to 4 percent. The other scenario, which is the optimistic
one, assumes that food inflation materializes at 9, 5 and 4 percent in the next three
years, and oil prices eases to 85 USD per barrel at the end of 2009. Under this
scenario, assuming a limited rate hike in the short term and gradual cuts starting
from the last quarter, inflation reaches 4 percent at the end of 2010.1 Therefore,
materialization of upside risks would require further tightening of the monetary policy
stance, while downward surprises in food and energy prices would be perceived as
an opportunity to bring inflation back to target in a shorter period.

1

More details on these projections are provided in the April Inflation Report.

Central Bank of Turkey

A protracted period of rising food and energy prices have led to significant
breaches in inflation targets since the adoption of the inflation targeting regime and
consequently increased the stickiness in inflation expectations, as economic agents
have become more backward looking. Under normal conditions, supply shocks are
expected to alter relative prices rather than the underlying inflation trend.
Nevertheless, the fact that several long-lasting shocks appeared concurrently has
increased the risks to the price setting behavior. Recent pick up in inflation
expectations requires the monetary policy to be cautious. In this respect, recent
developments in the pricing behavior and the underlying inflation trends are of
particular concern. It may be necessary to pursue a tighter monetary policy should
the price setting behavior further deteriorate.
Another major risk to the inflation outlook is a sharper than expected slowdown
in the global economic activity, which, in turn, could lead to further volatility in
financial markets. The eventual impact of the financial turmoil on the global
economic activity is yet to be seen. These uncertainties have been dampening the
risk appetite and thus slowing the capital flows to emerging economies. The CBT will
not react to temporary fluctuations in financial markets. Yet, we will not hesitate to
tighten monetary policy in case of a significant worsening in the overall pricing
behavior.
Finally, our medium-term projections assume that government expenditures
will evolve in line with the official projections and that there will be no further
increases in indirect taxes or administered price adjustments, except those required
by the automatic pricing mechanism. Any deviation from this may have an effect on
the outlook for inflation and monetary policy.
Conclusion
Inflation targets have been breached by a significant margin in the past two
years as a result of exceptionally persistent supply shocks, and there is a
considerable chance that the shocks are likely to stay for a while. Besides, the
ongoing uncertainty resulting from the global economy has been increasing the risks
related to the second round effects of these supply shocks. Our revised projections
incorporating the latest developments suggest that in 2008 and 2009 inflation is
likely to materialize at higher levels than 4 percent. Therefore, we envisage a
framework in which inflation forecasts serve as an anchor in the short term, while 4
percent targets continue to be the medium term anchor.
Extending the horizon within which inflation converges to the target does not
mean that monetary policy will be looser in the forthcoming period. On the contrary,
our forecasts presented above are based on a tighter monetary policy stance
compared to the previous period. Monetary policy will be more responsive to bad
news than good news in the period ahead. This approach reflects our firm
commitment to attaining price stability.

12

Central Bank of Turkey

Prudent monetary policy is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for
attaining price stability. The support from fiscal policy and structural reforms are also
critical in this respect. Sound fiscal policy has been one of the main factors in driving
inflation down to single digits. The role of fiscal policy will continue to be critical in
the road to price stability. Preserving the resilience of the economy, especially under
current conditions, requires the continuation of fiscal discipline and structural
reforms. In this respect, the European Union accession process and the
implementation of structural reforms envisaged in the economic program remain to
be of utmost importance. In particular, advances in structural reforms, which would
improve the quality of fiscal discipline and enhance the productivity, are monitored
closely by the CBT with regard to their implications on macroeconomic and price
stability.
