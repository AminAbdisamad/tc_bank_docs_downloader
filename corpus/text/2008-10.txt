The Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) has been implementing  a formal inflation-
targeting regime since the beginning of 2006. Central  Bank Law, as stipulated in the 
Article 42, requires the CBT to be accountable for the non-fulfillment of inflation 
targets. Inflation target for end-year 2008 was joint ly set with the Government as 4 
percent. To facilitate the accountability principle, our  policy statement titled 
“Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy in 2008” disclosed a q uarterly path consistent 
with the end-year 2008 targets along with an uncertai nty band. In this context, any 
breach of upper or lower limits of the band requires t he CBT to write an open letter 
to the Government, explaining the reasons for the breach  and the measures to be 
taken to ensure that inflation rate will return to le vels within pre-established limits. 
Inflation outturn as of March 2008 was 9.15 percent, br eaching the upper limit 
of the uncertainty band, which was set at 9.1 percent fo r the end of the first quarter 
(Figure 1). Accordingly, this open letter explains the r easons for this breach, 
presents the measures we have taken, and puts forth our mo netary policy strategy 
for the forthcoming period. This Open Letter will also  be presented to the IMF as part 
of the program conditionality.

Reasons For Breaching the Target 
The monetary tightening exercised since mid-2006 has been  successful in 
leading to a significant reduction in underlying infla tion. The fall in headline inflation, 
however, was more limited, owing mainly to factors larg ely beyond the control of 
monetary policy, such as developments in food, energy, an d administered prices. 
Prolonged increases in food and energy prices have recentl y led to upward 
pressure on headline inflation and in turn to upward revisions in inflation forecasts in 
many countries across the world. Turkey is not an exception in this regard, as 
deviations of inflation from our forecasts can be mostly a ttributed to these factors. 
For instance, our forecasts in October 2006 Inflation Rep ort suggested that inflation 
would converge to the 4 percent target at the end of t he first quarter of 2008. The 
forecast was based on a scenario where food inflation mod erated to levels 
comparable with medium term targets and oil prices rema ined stable at 60 USD per 
barrel. However, oil prices continued to rise and average d around 100 USD per 
barrel in the first quarter of 2008. Moreover, annual  food price inflation has 
continued to remain at elevated levels, reaching 13.4 pe rcent in March. As a 
consequence 6.13 percentage points of the 9.15 percent an nual CPI inflation in 
March resulted from the food and energy items (Figure 2).

Both domestic and international developments have played  a part on the 
course of food prices. A prolonged shortage of rainfall in Turkey resulted in low crop 
yields in 2007, which in turn translated to an adverse su pply shock. Strong global 
demand for food and continued elevation in agricultura l commodity prices further 
added to the domestic food inflation through the exter nal trade channel. Recently, 
adverse impacts of these factors have been quite visible especi ally in processed                                                                                      Central Bank of T urkey  
 3food prices. Accordingly, annual food inflation maintai ned its high levels with a 
marked contribution of about 2.3 points to the 3.1 per cent year-to-date headline 
inflation.  Therefore, food prices became the main fact or impeding the disinflation 
process (Figure 3, Table 1). 
Adverse developments in energy prices have been another ma jor factor in 
slowing the disinflation process. Rising oil prices continue d to lead to significant 
hikes in the prices of fuel-oil products. Elevated oil pri ces also affected the prices of 
energy items in the housing utilities, including electr icity tariff rates, which were 
adjusted upwards by a significant margin. Consequently, contribution of energy 
items to year-to-date CPI inflation reached to about 0.9 percentage points.

The decline in services inflation came to a halt in the f irst quarter of 2008. 
Elevated food and energy prices have been exerting upwar d pressures on the prices 
of catering and transport services. Rents and other services, on the other hand, 
continued to decelerate.

Global uncertainties and their reflections on the domest ic financial markets 
have led to exchange rate movements, which in turn affecte d March inflation 
especially through the prices of fuel and high-tech consum er durables. First round 
effects of exchange rate pass-through are expected to contin ue in the short term.  
Inflation in CPI excluding food, energy and tobacco ite ms remained flat over 
the previous quarter and remained at 4.8 percent, confi rming that the rise in inflation 
can be mostly attributed to factors beyond the control o f the monetary policy.

As noted above, inflation has recently been rising all o ver the world (Figure 6). 
Elevated prices of crude oil, agricultural products and ot her commodities have 
continued to exert inflationary pressures. Inflation in developed economies edged up 
in the last quarter of 2007 while emerging economies u nder inflation targeting have 
been facing an upward trend since June 2007. Annual inf lation in Turkey by the end 
of the first quarter was 9.2 percent, which is below its end-2006 level of 9.7 percent. 
During the same period, average inflation in emerging  market economies under 
inflation targeting rose from 3.4 percent to 6 percent .

Reaction of Monetary Policy 
The CBT has been clear about its approach in responding to inflation resulting 
from factors beyond its control: Monetary policy will to lerate the first round effects, 
but will promptly respond to any deterioration in th e overall pricing behavior. The 
policy pursued since September 2007 should be interprete d in this context.  
In September 2007, Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) d ecided to initiate the 
rate cuts, which had already been signaled earlier in t he year. Accordingly, policy 
rates were lowered by 225 basis points between Septembe r 2007 and February 
2008 (Table 2).

 In the January 2008 Open Letter, we indicated that u ncertainties in the global 
economy, hikes in electricity prices, and the risks to price se tting behavior compelled 
the CBT to be more responsive to the incoming informati on. The letter also 
expressed that further monetary accommodation would depe nd on the factors 
affecting medium term inflation outlook. Food and ene rgy prices and global 
uncertainties have continued to rise since then, feeding i nto the inflation 
expectations and core prices and thus increasing the risks rega rding the price 
setting behavior and the degree of inflation persistence . Consequently, the MPC 
decided to suspend the rate cuts in the March meeting and  announced a clear 
tightening bias going forward in the April meeting. 
Inflation Outlook 
Current supply and demand conditions support the downwa rd trend in inflation. 
Data on consumer credits suggest that monetary conditions co ntinue to be non-
accommodative. Annual growth rates in the automobile an d housing loans are at 
lower levels compared to the periods of vigorous domestic d emand (Figure 7). 
Although consumer credits displayed signs of recovery in 200 7, the cautious 
monetary policy stance and the tightening in global cre dit conditions are likely to 
restrain credit expansion in the forthcoming period.                                                                                      Central Bank of T urkey

The sharp slowdown in the second half of 2006 created a slack in the 
economy. The recent methodological change in national a ccounts led to a limited 
upward revision in our output gap measure and hence did  not change the inflation 
outlook. Looking ahead, we expect a continued moderation  in economic activity and 
non-farm employment on the back of rising precautionary  saving due to global and 
domestic uncertainties (Figure 8).  
 Accordingly, demand and capacity conditions are expected t o continue to 
support the disinflation (Figure 9). Therefore, assumin g that supply shocks gradually 
fade out over time, headline inflation is expected to d ecelerate. Figure 7: Consumer Loans (Annual Percentage Change)

The domestic currency has depreciated by more than 15 per cent in nominal 
terms since the beginning of the year (Figure 10). Not withstanding the expected 
deceleration in the core inflation indicators in the me dium term, the first round 
impacts of the exchange rate pass-through may be significan t in the short term.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Longer term interest rates have increased lately due to rising risk premium 
(Figure 11). Although higher interest rates contain th e domestic demand and thus 
support disinflation, the impact of the higher risk prem ium on the pricing behavior 
should be closely monitored.  Figure 9: Output Gap

The CBT survey of expectations suggests that economic agents e xpect 
inflation to pursue a downward trend. One year forwa rd expectations are at 7 
percent, whereas 2-year ahead inflation expectations stan d at around 6 percent. 
However, the recent upward movement in expectations has in creased the risks to 
the price setting behavior (Figure 12).

Our revised forecasts for medium term inflation incorpora te more conservative 
assumptions on food prices compared to January Inflation R eport, which envisaged 
a correction in food inflation justified by more favora ble weather conditions. 
However, the long-awaited correction in food prices has n ot materialized yet. 
Processed food inflation accelerated even further on the back of rising global 
demand and elevated agricultural commodity prices. Again st this backdrop, we have 
raised our assumptions for food inflation to 13 percent for the year 2008 and 8 
percent for the year 2009. These changes have led to upw ard revisions in our 
inflation forecasts, by about 1.2 points for 2008 and 1 .1 points for 2009. Figure 11: Benchmark Interest Rate and Policy Rate

 10 The assumption on oil prices in the January Inflation Re port stood at 85 USD 
per barrel. However, oil prices averaged about 100 USD in the first quarter of 2008. 
Considering the most recent developments, we have revised o ur assumption for oil 
prices to 105 USD per barrel. Moreover, we assume that e lectricity tariffs will be 
adjusted as needed by the automatic pricing mechanism. Th ese changes imply 
upward revisions in our forecasts by 0.9 points for end-20 08, and 0.4 points for end-
2009.  
Although weak domestic demand should limit the second rou nd effects of the 
exchange rate pass-through, the first round impact of the  recent depreciation is 
estimated to be close to 2-percentage points at the end of 2008, which implies 
further upward revision in our forecasts. 
Accordingly, we now forecast inflation to be around 9.3  percent at the end of 
2008. Our medium term forecasts suggest, with 70 percent probability that, under 
the assumption of a measured and gradual tightening to wards mid-2008 and 
constant policy rates thereafter for the rest of 2008, i nflation will be between 4.9 and 
8.5 percent (mid point 6.7) at the end of 2009 (Figu re7). Assuming a gradual 
moderation in food inflation, headline inflation is expected to decelerate to 4.9 
percent at the end of 2010 and to 4 percent by mid-20 11. We expect non-food 
inflation to be lower than these figures.

To sum up, supply shocks have turned out to be more persiste nt than 
expected, increasing the risks to the second round effects and  necessitating a 
significant upward revision in our inflation forecasts. Acco rdingly, monetary policy 
has already assumed a more cautious stance in order to eli minate the 
materialization of potential second round effects. Ensuri ng a steady decline in 
inflation will likely require tight monetary policy t o be maintained for an extended -6 -4 -2 0246810 12

 11 period. Even then, the earliest time for reaching the 4 percent medium term targets 
is likely to extend beyond two years. 
It should be emphasized that any new data or informat ion on the inflation 
outlook may lead to a change in our policy stance. There fore, the path for the policy 
rates indicated above should not be perceived as a commitme nt on behalf of the 
CBT. 
Revised projections suggest that the contribution of energ y, food and services 
will be close to 5 percent at the end of 2009. In othe r words, assuming no further 
hikes in administered prices (except the ones implied by au tomatic pricing 
mechanisms), meeting the 4 percent target at the end of  2009 would be possible 
only if the prices of goods excluding food, energy and t obacco deflate by 3 percent.  
However, factors such as rising import prices, potential secon d round impacts of the 
supply shocks, and the structural inertia in inflation coul d continue to impose 
downward stickiness in goods prices. Therefore, converging to  the medium term 
target of 4 percent may extend beyond two years, even w hen tight monetary policy 
is maintained for an extended period.  
Under these circumstances, getting inflation back to the 4 percent by the end 
of 2009 would require offsetting the first round effe cts, and thus create undesired 
fluctuations in the economic activity and relative prices. T hat is why we envisage a 
framework in which inflation remains higher than 4 per cent at the end of 2009. 
The forecasts presented above deserve particular attention,  given that inflation 
is likely to stay above the target in the next two years.  The forecasts should serve as 
anchors for the intermediate term, representing the in flation path that is likely to be 
followed on the way to 4 percent medium term target.  
Risks 
Our revised forecasts are based on quite conservative assumptio ns, especially 
on food and energy prices, implying that downside risks a re as significant as upside 
risks. April Inflation Report provides projections under a lternative scenarios for food 
and energy prices. The pessimistic scenario assumes food infla tion to materialize at 
17, 11 and 10 percent in the next three years, and oil  prices to soar to 150 USD per 
barrel at the end of 2009. Under this scenario, assuming  that policy rates increase 
gradually throughout the year 2008 and then stay const ant for while, it takes four 
years for inflation to go back to 4 percent. The other scenario, which is the optimistic 
one, assumes that food inflation materializes at 9, 5 a nd 4 percent in the next three 
years, and oil prices eases to 85 USD per barrel at the end of 2009. Under this 
scenario, assuming a limited rate hike in the short term and gradual cuts starting 
from the last quarter, inflation reaches 4 percent at t he end of 2010. 1 Therefore, 
materialization of upside risks would require further ti ghtening of the monetary policy 
stance, while downward surprises in food and energy price s would be perceived as 
an opportunity to bring inflation back to target in a  shorter period. 
                                                
1 More details on these projections are provided in the April Inflation Report.                                                                                      Central Bank of T urkey  
 12 A protracted period of rising food and energy prices ha ve led to significant 
breaches in inflation targets since the adoption of the inflation targeting regime and 
consequently increased the stickiness in inflation expectation s, as economic agents 
have become more backward looking. Under normal condition s, supply shocks are 
expected to alter relative prices rather than the underl ying inflation trend. 
Nevertheless, the fact that several long-lasting shocks appear ed concurrently has 
increased the risks to the price setting behavior. Recent pi ck up in inflation 
expectations requires the monetary policy to be cautious. In this respect, recent 
developments in the pricing behavior and the underlying  inflation trends are of 
particular concern. It may be necessary to pursue a tighte r monetary policy should 
the price setting behavior further deteriorate. 
Another major risk to the inflation outlook is a sharper  than expected slowdown 
in the global economic activity, which, in turn, could le ad to further volatility in 
financial markets. The eventual impact of the financial t urmoil on the global 
economic activity is yet to be seen. These uncertainties have  been dampening the 
risk appetite and thus slowing the capital flows to emerg ing economies. The CBT will 
not react to temporary fluctuations in financial markets.  Yet, we will not hesitate to 
tighten monetary policy in case of a significant worsenin g in the overall pricing 
behavior. 
Finally, our medium-term projections assume that governm ent expenditures 
will evolve in line with the official projections and th at there will be no further 
increases in indirect taxes or administered price adjustment s, except those required 
by the automatic pricing mechanism. Any deviation from t his may have an effect on 
the outlook for inflation and monetary policy. 
Conclusion 
Inflation targets have been breached by a significant ma rgin in the past two 
years as a result of exceptionally persistent supply shocks, an d there is a 
considerable chance that the shocks are likely to stay for a while. Besides, the 
ongoing uncertainty resulting from the global economy has been increasing the risks 
related to the second round effects of these supply shocks. O ur revised projections 
incorporating the latest developments suggest that in 200 8 and 2009 inflation is 
likely to materialize at higher levels than 4 percent. Therefore, we envisage a 
framework in which inflation forecasts serve as an anchor in  the short term, while 4 
percent targets continue to be the medium term anchor.  
Extending the horizon within which inflation converges t o the target does not 
mean that monetary policy will be looser in the forth coming period. On the contrary, 
our forecasts presented above are based on a tighter mone tary policy stance 
compared to the previous period. Monetary policy will b e more responsive to bad 
news than good news in the period ahead. This approach reflects our firm 
commitment to attaining price stability.

Prudent monetary policy is a necessary but not a sufficien t condition for 
attaining price stability. The support from fiscal policy  and structural reforms are also 
critical in this respect. Sound fiscal policy has been one o f the main factors in driving 
inflation down to single digits. The role of fiscal pol icy will continue to be critical in 
the road to price stability. Preserving the resilience of  the economy, especially under 
current conditions, requires the continuation of fiscal di scipline and structural 
reforms. In this respect, the European Union accession proce ss and the 
implementation of structural reforms envisaged in the eco nomic program remain to 
be of utmost importance. In particular, advances in structu ral reforms, which would 
improve the quality of fiscal discipline and enhance the productivity, are monitored 
closely by the CBT with regard to their implications on  macroeconomic and price 
stability.
