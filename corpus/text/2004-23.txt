PRESS RELEASE  
ON 
REALIZATIONS OF MONETARY PROGRAM FOR APRIL  
 
 
I.  REALIZATIONS ON MONETARY PROGRAM IN APRIL 2004 
 
In the Letter of Intent dated April 2, 2004, targets were specified for Base Money and 
Net International Reserves as performance criterion and indicative targets were specified for 
Net Domestic Assets.  While Base Money slightly exceeded the targeted level, Net Domestic 
Assets remained below the upper limit and Net International Reserves remained above the 
lower limit as of the end of April.  
1. The upper limit for Base Money specified as performance criterion in the Letter of 
Intent is calculated by using the averages o f the last five working days of the month. While 
the average of the Base Money in the last five working days of April became TL 17.508 trillion, the target set as TL 17.500 trillion was exceed by TL 8 trillion.  
2.  As is closely followed by the public and elaborated in our press release dated April 
2, 2004, the Central Bank’s monetary policy is set according to the consistency of the future 
course of inflation with the targeted inflation figures, and developments in monetary aggregates are only evaluated i n the light of their signals about the future inflation. Within 
this framework, short -term interest rates are the main monetary policy instrument of the 
Central Bank that is under its control, instead of monetary aggregates. In April 2004, the Base Money s lightly exceeded the targeted level and this can be evaluated as a consequence of the 
reduction in inflation and interest rates, increase in confidence, and the reverse currency substitution, rather than the sharp recovery in consumption that could jeopardize the targeted 
inflation rate. Certainly, due attention is paid to the informative value of the movements in 
monetary aggregates in the long run, and developments in monetary aggregates are closely 
monitored, as a natural part of the currently implemente d monetary policy.  
 3.  The lower limit for Net International Reserves for end -April was specified as 
(minus) US dollar – 2.000 million. The realizations pertaining to Net International Reserves 
and its sub- items as of April 30, 2004 are as follows:  
  
 
 
 
 (Million USD)  
Net International Reserves of the Central Bank                     (1)     16.287  
Treasury’s debt to IMF (2)     14.496  
Treasury’s debt in terms of foreign exchange (maturity shorter than 1 year)   (3)       - 
Program Definition: Net International Reserves     (4=1 -2-3)      1.791  
  
Thus, the Net International Reserves item, which is defined in the program, became 
US dollar 1.791 million, and exceeded the lower limit of (minus) US dollar –2.000 million 
specified  as the performance criterion.   
 4. The upper limit of the indicative target for Net Domestic Assets item by end -April 
has been specified as TL 31.600 trillion and the averages of the last five working days have 
been taken into account in calculation.  
Realizations pertaining to Net Domestic Assets and its sub -items are shown in the 
table below:  
  
 (Trillion TL)  
Net Domestic Assets of the Central Bank                                  (1)  5.208       
Treasury’s debt to the IMF                                                 (2) 20.867  
Treasury’s debt in terms of foreign exchange (maturity shorter than 1 year)    (3)                         
- 
Program Definition: Net International                                (4=1+2+3)         
26.076  
  
Thus, the average of Net Domestic Assets in the period in question became TL 26.076 
trillion and remained below the indicative upper limit of TL 31.600 trillion.
