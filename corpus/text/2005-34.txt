August Inflation and Outlook
I. — PRICE DEVELOPMENTS

i1. According to the indices with base year 2003, the CPI increased by 0.85 percent
and the PPI by 1.04 in August 2005. Annual inflation in the CPI and PPI became 7.9i
percent and 4.32 percent, respectively (Graph 1i).

2. The special CPI aggregate F which excludes energy, alcoholic beverages, tobacco
products, other goods with administered prices, and indirect taxes, dropped by 0.09
percent in monthly terms, while the G index, which is obtained by excluding
unprocessed food from the F index, decreased by 0.03 percent (Table i, Graph 2).
The year-on-year rise in August for these indices became 6.74 percent and 7.47

percent, respectively (Graph İ).

3. In August, agricultural prices decreased by 0.53 percent, whereas the PPI

excluding agriculture (industrial prices) increased by 1.45 percent (Table İ).

Developments in Consumer Prices

4. The main determinant of CPI increases in August was the tax adjustments made
in the prices of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products in July. The said
adjustments had slightly affected the July inflation. The net contribution of price
increases to the alcoholic beverages and tobacco group to the rise in the CPI in
August was approximately 0.80 point. In addition, housing and transportation groups
became the main groups that exerted upward pressure on August inflation. The
decline in prices of the clothing and footwear group restrained the increase in

inflation.

5. Prices in the housing group increased by 0.9i percent due to the 2.63 percent
increase iİn rents and the rise in prices of petroleum products. Iİt is considered that
the increases in prices of white goods and electrical household devices resulted from

the exchange rate.

6. The 1.42 percent increase in the transportation group stemmed from the increase
in local transportation (shuttles and public buses) and intercity transportation fees.

Cargo and shipment charges also rose during this period. Unless there is a reversal in
the upward trend in oil prices in the upcoming period, other adjustments likely to be

made in transportation fees may display similar courses.

7. The prices in the clothing and footwear group decreased by 5.07 percent and
became the main factor that brought down inflation in August. Clothing prices are
likely to be at high rates in September, October and November due to the start of

the fall—winter season.

8. The volatilitly of inflaton in the clothing and footwear group substantially
increased in 2005 compared to previous years. In this context, price changes were
sharper in both directions. The aforementioned movements in clothing prices are also

leading to fluctuations in monthly increases in the special CPI aggregates. (Graph 2).

9. In August, inflation in the food and non-alcoholic beverages group was V - 0.07.
No significant movement is expected in this group in September. In October,

however, food prices may increase due to the start of Ramadan.

10. — Analyzing the special CPI Aggregates (SCA), annual increases in E, F and G
aggregates decreased compared to the previous month and remained below CPI
inflation. The fact that the inflation in these aggregates remained well below general

CPI inflation points to the strong influence of petroleum and tobacco products on
inflation. The main information provided by the SCA shows that the inflation trend is

consistent with the end-year target of eight percent. (Table İ).

Developments in Producer Prices

11i. —In August, the downward trend in agricultural prices continued, albeit at a
slower pace. Thus, the drop in agricultural prices in the June — August period became
6.25 percent. The rate of decline was 7.45 percent in the same period of the

previous year.

12. —The increase in the PPI index stemmed from the 1.48 percent rise in the
manufacturing industry (Graph 3). Along with the price increases in coke and refined
petroleum products, price increases in the manufacturing of tobacco and textile
products also played a significant role in the increase in the manufacturing industry.

13. — The high rate of increase in the production of tobacco products is remarkable.
It is understood that this increase mainly resulted from the reflection of the changes
in the lump-sum tax on prices while calculating the indices of the said sub-sector. İt
is considered that as a result of the guotas applied to China, EU countries" demand
for textile products have moved towards other countries including Turkey, and this

affected the increase in production prices of textile products.

14. — The general upward trend in prices of manufacturing industry in the last two

months was not observed in August. On the other hand, prices increased in chemical
goods and plastic-rubber production, which use oil products as input. The increase in
international oil prices is also considered to be influential in this development. Price
increases iİn groups related to the manufacturing industry, such as electrical
machinery and appliances production, were affected by the devaluation of the New
Turkish lira in August 2005. As mentioned in previous reports, the manufacturing

industry, and thus the PPI, is very susceptible to oil prices and exchange rates.

I.— OUTLOOK

Inflation Developments
15. —The main determinant of August 2005 inflation was the adjustment made in
the special consumption tax of tobacco products. Undoubtediy, what matters most
for monetary policy is the information value of these figures related to the future,
rather than the inflation realizations. In August, even though annual inflation seems
to be higher compared to July 2005, according to the prices that are adjusted
excluding tax increases the annual inflation of August 2005 is lower than that of July
2005. In fact, in August 2005 the annual increase in special CPI aggregates
calculated by excluding tax (F and G) has slowed down compared to the previous

month.

16. — As a result, price increases due to tax adjustments are only temporary and do
not convey any information on the future trend of inflation. Thus, the influence of
these increases on future inflation figures and expectations will remain rather limited.
The CBRT makes a distinction between the temporary and permanent effects of
shocks on inflation and does not respond unless these shocks affect the mediumlong term inflation forecasts. Within this context, the tax shock of August 2005 sets
an important example. If the effects of shocks are thought to be temporary and İf it
is considered that inflation will gradually come closer to the target in the medium
term, such shocks will not be taken into consideration in monetary policy decisions,

even if they threaten the short-term attainability of inflation target.

17. — At this point it is crucial to properly analyze the temporary/permanent factors

of the effects of oll price developments on inflation. As mentioned in the Inflation
and Outlook and Monetary Policy Report published last month, the main factor
underlying the loss of pace in the disinflation process is the developments in oll
prices. The primary effects of oil price increases on twelve-month cumulative inflation
differ between İ and İ,5 points. Moreover, the delayed primary effects are expected
to appear in 2006. In other words, even if oll prices remain stable as of today, the
effects of recent increases on 2006 inflation will be above a neğgligible level. At
present, the fact that medium term expectations are not remarkabiy affected is a
favorable development. Although the annual disinflation process has slowed down,
expectations related to the next twelve months keep declining. Besides, the relative
price effects are not yet observed in the pricing behaviors of the sectors that do not
use Oil as input. For these reasons, CBRT's reactions to the increases in oil prices
have been minimal so far. However, it should be kept in mind that the necessary
response will be made, if there is a deterioration in inflation expectations and pricing

behaviors in the upcoming period.

18. — Prices of the services group are one of the main factors that might pose a risk
in terms of inflation in the future period. The disinflation process in the services
group has had a tendency to stabilize since the last guarter of 2004. İt is early to
ascertain whether this decline is permanent or not, in spite of the downward trend in
the sector in August. The increases in rents prices were realized above the indexation
to past inflation. In August 2005, the rents sub-group displayed the highest increase
in the last four years and became 2.63 percent. The increase in the said sub-group
reached 13.1İ percent in the first eight months of the year. Ihis trend is not expected
to turn downward in the short term. The increases in entertainment-culture and
restaurant-hotel groups were realized above the general inflation trend in the first
eight months of the year. Meanwhile, price increases in the goods group are
predicted to be low due to ongoing increased productivity and openness and
improved competitiveness. The increases in public prices and tax adjustments will be

shaped by the developments in exchange rates, oil prices and fiscal discipline.

Outlook of the Factors Affecting Inflation
19. — There is no doubt that the extent of the secondary effects of oil prices will

largely depend on demand developments. Provided that the demand strengthens in
the upcoming period, prices can rise in those sectors, where petroleum products are
used as input, in order to compensate the narrowing margins. Moreover, in case the
demand is strong enough, price increases can also be observed in the sectors, where
petroleum products are not used as İnput, as a result of the relative price effect. In
this context, the trend to be displayed by demand conditions in the upcoming period

is influential.

20. —Credit developments stand out as important data on economic activity and
domestic demand. In August 2005, high annual rates of increase continued in
consumer credits and individual credit cards, whereas in housing credits, monthliy
rates of increase slowed down. Individual credit card İiabilities decreased on a
monthiy basis, while vehicle credits maintained a stable trend. The business
tendency survey indicates that the rise in domestic sales occurred in a controlled
manner as of July. Although automobile and white goods sales declined in July 2005
compared to the previous year, production in these sectors maintains high levels
owing to foreign demand. Nevertheless, surveys and the latest realizations point out
that the increase in foreign demand also slowed down relatively. Meanwhile,
consumer confidence indices and capacity utilization ratios are at lower İevels
compared to the previous year. Housing and new office investments display a
significant rise, in spite of the slowdown in machinery-eguipment investments. To
sum up, although the developments in production, capacity and domestic demand
were insufficient to change the outlook of the previous month, they strengthened the

perceptions that total demand developments will occur in a controlled manner.

21. — In the second guarter of 2005, the rise in national income is expected to be
low compared to the first guarter. However, it is predicted that the growth rate will
converge to program projections from the third guarter on, thus, economic growth
will be in line with the level expected in the program throughout 2005. As foreseen in
the previous Inflation and Outlook Reports, employment increased due to the fact
that investments promoted new employment areas in 2005. These developments
increase the pressure on unit labor costs and may pose a risk to inflation due to their
deferred effect on domestic demand. Nevertheless, in light of the above-mentioned
developments, especially the fact that the deferred demand on durables is largely

met, domestic demand is expected to occur in a controlled manner throughout 2005.
Moreover, it is predicted that the employment supply will grow rapidiy due to the
increasing participation in employment and rapid population growth and that this
development will continue to limit unit labor costs in the overall economy. There is
no doubt that the contribution made by unit labor costs to the downward trend of
inflation will be less compared to previous years. In this context, it is crucial that the
incomes policy of the public sector, which is a factor that directly affects pricing

behaviors, is conducted in consistency with the inflation target.

22. TIt is believed that the effect of the rise in civil service salaries for 2006
disclosed last month would remain limited if the extra burden to be imposed on the
budget is compensated. Meanwhile, for the sake of keeping the guality of fiscal
discipline as well as the indirect effects under control, it is very important to
compensate this extra burden by expenditure-dampening policies instead of making

public price adjustments and tax increments.

23. At this point, it should be highlighted that the Central Bank, which has a
medium-term perspective, will certainiy attach greater importance to the mediumterm outlook of fiscal policy. As the formal inflation targeting strategy will be adopted
in the upcoming period, the medium-term perspective needs to be more clearly
manifested. Within this framework, a three-year budget system and a centralized
budget implementation will be put into practice as of fiscal year 2006, and thus, a
more transparent, accountable and predictable budget policy will be achieved. All
these implementations will be closely monitored, as they will play important roles in
making the medium-term perspective more prevalent. The framework in guestion

would also contribute to enhancing the guality of fiscal discipline.

24. — There has recentily been a recovery in producer prices, excluding agriculture.
İt is expected that this recovery would continue in September and further accelerate
with the effect of the rise in the prices of petroleum products and natural gas. In
case the rise in the prices of oil and natural gas continues, the rapid increase in
producer prices index might continue as well. As the effects of these developments
have been until now only partially been reflected on electricity prices, the pressure

exerted by input prices on inflation has remained limited. A prospective rise in
electricity prices in the upcoming period might pose risk to the medium-term inflation

trend.

25b. — Lastiy, any fluctuations in international liguidity conditions and news from the
EU about Turkey's accession still apply as risk factors with respect to inflation.
However, it should be kept in mind that Turkey has undergone similar processes
many times in the past four years and such unfavorable impacts have been shortlived thanks to the economic stability and confidence established by the economic
program. All these factors point to the fact that giant steps have been taken towards
long-lasting economic stability. We believe that, provided that the current economic
program is maintained, the effects of any unfavorable developments would remain
limited and the main trends would be determined by economic fundamentals.
Undoubtediy, ensuring full-fFledged macroeconomic stability, achieving sustainable
development and attaining lasting price stability would be possible only if the

structural reforms are carried out with the same degree of determination.

Conclusion
26. — Within the framework of the main scenario, in which there is no halt in fiscal
discipline and no external shocks and providing oil prices do not shift much above
current prices, it is projected that annual inflation will move downwards as of the end
of the last guarter and reach the end-year target. However, as has been reiterated
before, the period, during which the inflation figures for 2005 were taken into
account, is now over. Any decisions made as of today should be considered within
the context of 2006. The factors that urged the Central Bank to be more cautious
about the inflation target for 2006 in the last two months have been the rigidity in
services inflation, uncertainty in demand indicators, rapid credit rise and worries
about the secondary effects of the rise in oil prices. While the recent data on demand
indicate that the total rise in demand will remain controlled, other developments will

be closely monitored.

27. Inlight of the above evaluations that take account of the views put forward at
the Monetary Policy Committee meeting dated September 8, 2005, it has been
decided to maintain the level of short-term interest rates applied at the CBRT

Interbank Money Market and the Istanbul Stock Exchange Repo-Reverse Repo
Market. With current available data, it can be asserted that short-term interest rates
will most probabiy move downwards in the upcoming period. Clearly, any new data
that would affect the future trend of inflation and any risks that may emerge would

necessitate the revision of this position.
