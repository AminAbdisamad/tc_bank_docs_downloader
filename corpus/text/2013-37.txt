SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 23 July 2013

Inflation Developments
1. In June, consumer prices edged up by 0.76 percent and annual inflation reached
8.30 percent. This uptick was attributed to the rise in unprocessed food prices
besides the base effect in energy prices. Total contribution of price increases in
food and energy groups to annual inflation increased by 1.7 percentage points in
June. Meanwhile, core inflation indicators remained on a mild track.
2. On the food and non-alcoholic beverages front, annual inflation soared by 5.81
percentage points to 12.88 percent. As for the unprocessed food group, driven
both by the price hikes in fresh fruits and the base effect in vegetable prices,
annual inflation registered a remarkable increase. On the other hand, annual
processed food inflation receded to 8.11 percent. Bread prices remained on an
upward track in this group, while other processed food products maintained a mild
course. Leading indicators pertaining to July point that the downward correction in
unprocessed food prices has not started yet.
3. Energy inflation went up owing to the depreciation in the Turkish lira. Due to the
recent increases and the base effect, annual rate of increase in energy prices is
envisaged to push annual inflation up in July as it did in June. Meanwhile, the
base effect is estimated to pull inflation down considerably as of August.
4. Prices of services went up by 1.19 percent, and annual services inflation
increased to 7.88 percent in June. Nearly 0.5 percentage points of the rise in
annual inflation was attributed to the hikes in driving course fees. Excluding this
one-time effect, seasonally adjusted data suggest that the underlying trend of
services inflation remained almost unchanged on a monthly basis.
5. Annual inflation in core goods group receded in all subcategories, particularly
clothing, and stood at 3.28 percent in June. It is observed that the depreciation in
the Turkish lira has not been evidently reflected on to prices yet; and thus the
seasonally adjusted trend of core goods prices maintained its downtrend in June.
Accordingly, seasonally adjusted trends of core inflation indicators remained on a
mild course.

6. In sum, notwithstanding the mild course of core inflation indicators, inflation is
expected to fluctuate in the short term due to the volatility in food and energy
inflation, base effects and the movements in the exchange rates. Accordingly,
inflation is projected to rise in July before falling significantly in August.

Factors Affecting Inflation
7. Second-quarter data point that domestic demand follows a healthy recovery in
line with expectations. Industrial production posted an increase in April-May
period compared to the first-quarter average. Industrial production is envisaged to
register a month-on-month increase in June as well. Improved consumer
confidence in April and May underpinned the rise in domestic demand. Despite
the slight decline in confidence indices in June, consumption demand is expected
to pick up on a quarterly basis in the second quarter. In fact, sales of automobiles
and credit growth maintained a robust trend of increase in this period. Although
displaying a favorable outlook, indicators of investment demand point to a weaker
growth compared to the consumption demand.
8. Data regarding the second quarter foreign trade and the current account balance
are in line with expectations. Import demand revives upon the recovery in the
domestic demand, while exports grow at a moderate pace. Annual cumulative
foreign trade and current account deficit figures in the short term are expected to
continue with an upward trend mainly due to gold imports. On the other hand, the
current policy framework, which puts special emphasis on macro-financial risks,
limits the deterioration in the current account balance. Accordingly, current
account deficit, excluding gold trade, has been on a stable course.
9. Non-farm employment remained on a steadily increasing track in April 2013.
Nevertheless, seasonally adjusted unemployment rate remained unchanged upon
the rise in employment participation rate. While the recent rise in non-farm
employment was mainly driven by the industrial sector besides the construction
sector, service sector employment remained flat. The PMI data signal that
industrial employment will continue to increase, albeit at a decelerating pace. Yet,
uncertainty regarding the global economy remains as risk factor that may restrain
investment and employment growth in the forthcoming period.
Monetary Policy and Risks
10. The meeting included an assessment of the impact of the recent developments in
capital flows, which have weakened since May due to increasing uncertainty
regarding the global monetary policies. The Committee observed that loan growth

continues to hover above the reference rate despite the slowdown in capital flows,
indicating that tightening the monetary policy stance under these circumstances
would support financial stability.
11. The Committee also assessed the medium term projections prepared for the July
Inflation Report. It was stated that several coinciding developments have recently
affected inflation expectations adversely. Surging unprocessed food prices, rising
oil prices, and the increased exchange rate volatility may continue to have
adverse impact on inflation in the short term. Overall, given the assumptions
underlying the inflation forecasts and external conditions, end-2013 inflation
forecast was revised upwards mainly on account of the developments in the
exchange rate and oil prices. These developments are expected to have a limited
effect on end-2014 inflation due to the weak outlook of the global economy and
the mild course of domestic demand. Yet, the Committee indicated that a
measured monetary tightening is deemed necessary in order to contain a
deterioration in the pricing behavior.
12. In order to support the price and financial stability, the Committee decided to raise
the upper bound of the interest rate corridor. It was underscored that cautious
stance will be maintained until the inflation outlook is in line with the medium term
targets. In this respect, additional monetary tightening will be implemented when
necessary.
13. Currently, data regarding global economic activity do not reveal a stable pattern.
Risk appetite and capital flows may remain volatile, should uncertainties regarding
economic policies of advanced economies persist. This situation may pose risks
regarding the outlook for inflation and financial stability. Materialization of such a
risk will prompt the Central Bank to use the interest corridor and other policy
instruments to contain the excessive volatility in the exchange rate.
14. On the other hand, the possibility of further delays in the global recovery and the
continuation of quantitative easing policies for an extended period by the central
banks of advanced economies remain as downside risks, in which case capital
flows to emerging economies may re-accelerate. Materialization of such a
scenario would prompt the Central Bank to engage in a strategy in which shortterm money market rates are lowered by easing liquidity conditions, while the
adverse impact of rapid capital inflows on financial stability is alleviated through
reserve requirement policy and reserve options mechanism.
15. Due to ongoing uncertainties regarding the global economy and the volatility in
capital flows, the Committee decided to increase the flexibility of the liquidity
management. To this end, developments regarding price stability and financial

stability will be closely monitored and necessary adjustments will be made in the
composition of Turkish lira liquidity provided by the Central Bank.
16. The Committee monitors fiscal policy developments and tax adjustments closely
with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy
stance takes the fiscal framework outlined in the Medium Term Program as given.
In this respect, it is assumed that fiscal discipline will be sustained and there will
be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices. A revision in the monetary policy
stance may be considered, should the fiscal stance deviate significantly from this
framework and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation
outlook.
17. Prudent fiscal and financial sector policies are crucial for preserving the resilience
of our economy against existing global imbalances. Strengthening the structural
reform agenda that would ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and
reduce the savings deficit would support macroeconomic stability in the mediumterm. This will also provide more flexibility for monetary policy and improve social
welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities persistently
at low levels. In this respect, implementation of the structural reforms envisaged
by the Medium Term Program remains to be of utmost importance.
