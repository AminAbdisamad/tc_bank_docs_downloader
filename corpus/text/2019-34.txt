Press Release on Reserve Requirements
19 August 2019, No: 2019-34
With the intention of using reserve requirements more flexibly and effectively as a
macroprudential tool to support financial stability, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey
(CBRT) has decided to change the ratio of and the remuneration applied to required reserves.
Accordingly, the reserve requirement ratios for Turkish lira liabilities and the remuneration rates
for Turkish lira-denominated required reserves are linked to the annual growth rates of the total
of banks’ Turkish lira-denominated standardized cash loans and cash loans under close
monitoring, excluding foreign currency-indexed loans and loans extended to banks.
For banks whose loan growth is between 10% and 20% (reference values), the reserve
requirement ratios for Turkish lira liabilities in all maturity brackets excluding deposits and
participation funds with 1-year or longer maturity (excluding deposits/participation funds
obtained from banks abroad) and other liabilities with longer than 3-year maturity (including
deposits/participation funds obtained from banks abroad), will be set at 2%. The reserve
requirement ratios for other banks are left unchanged.
Additionally, the current remuneration rate of 13% applied to Turkish lira-denominated required
reserves, is set at 15% for banks with a loan growth between the reference values and at 5% to
others.
According to the new arrangement, loan growth rates will be calculated in each reserve
requirement period and the banks whose loan growth is between the reference values will be
subject to the related reserve requirement ratios and remuneration rates in the next threemonths (six reserve requirement periods).
