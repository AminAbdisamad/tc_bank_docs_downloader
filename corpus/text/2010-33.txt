The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term
interest rates as follows:
a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) was kept constant at 7 percent,
b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate was reduced from 6.25 percent to 5.75
percent, while lending rate was kept constant at 8.75 percent,
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing
rate was reduced from 2.25 percent to 1.75 percent, while lending rate was kept at
11.75 percent,
d) The interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo
transactions was kept constant at 7.75 percent.
Recent data releases suggest that economic activity continues to recover. Uncertainties
regarding external demand persist, while domestic demand displays a relatively stronger
outlook. It would take a while before industrial capacity utilization rates return to their pre-crisis
levels. Although employment conditions continue to improve, unemployment rates remain at
high levels. It is expected that inflation would be on a declining path in the forthcoming period,
while core inflation would remain consistent with the medium-term targets.
In light of these assessments, the Committee has reiterated that it would be necessary
to maintain policy rates at current levels for some time, and to keep them at low levels for a long
period. On the other hand, in order to enhance the efficient functioning of the Turkish lira
market, the Committee has decided to reduce the borrowing rates by 50 basis points.
Expectations of more accommodative monetary policies in developed economies have
been leading to a surge in capital flows toward emerging markets. This development, coupled
with the relative improvement in the creditworthiness of Turkey, exacerbates the risks related to
the divergence between the domestic and external demand. While not yet a significant concern
regarding financial stability, the Committee has indicated that these developments support the
implementation of the “exit strategy” measures. Therefore, the Committee has indicated that it
would be appropriate to proceed with the remaining measures outlined in the exit strategy that
were envisaged to be implemented by the end of 2010. Moreover, the Committee has judged
that the 3-month repo funding is no longer needed.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook
may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight
working days.
