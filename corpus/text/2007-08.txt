DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Meeting Date: April 18, 2007
Committee Members
Durmuş Yılmaz (Governor), Erdem Başçı, Burhan Göklemez, M. İbrahim Turhan,
Mehmet Yörükoğlu.

The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to keep shortterm interest rates (policy rates) unchanged as follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 17.50 percent, and lending rate at
22.50 percent,
b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate applied between 4:00 p.m. –
4:30 p.m. at 13.50 percent, lending rate at 25.50 percent,
c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided
for primary dealers via repo transactions at 21.50 percent.
The Committee evaluates the recent data on economic activity as broadly
consistent with the outlook presented in the January Inflation Report. While the
slowdown in private consumption demand continues, foreign demand remains
relatively strong. Aggregate demand conditions continue to support disinflation.
Against this background, the disinflation trend is expected to become discernible
starting from the second quarter of 2007. Nevertheless, the Committee decided to
enhance the cautious policy stance against the risks such as the gap between
inflation expectations and targets, the backward looking pricing behavior, increase in
oil prices, prevailing uncertainties, and the stickiness related to services price
inflation.
The monetary tightening since June 2006 is affecting the domestic demand
as expected. The lagged effects on inflation are yet to be seen. The potential
impacts of the progress in the structural reform agenda and the developments in
incomes policy as well as public sector non-interest expenditures on inflation and
inflation expectations are carefully evaluated. Within this framework, the Committee
assesses that meeting the medium term inflation targets requires the maintenance
of the tight policy stance.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the
inflation outlook will lead the Committee to reconsider its stance.
A brief summary of the assessments of the Committee will be released within
eight working days.
