PRESS RELEASE

A. A GENERAL EVALUATION

The mood of political uncertainty triggered by recent developments has once
again exerted an adverse effect on economic expectations, on exchange rate, and on
market interest rates, as was The case in the past. Lt is deemed useful to evaluate the
recent perception of political uncertainty as follows.

1. During the period starting from the last autumn up until the emergence of
political ambiguity, the program has started to produce positive results restoring the
market sentiment. At the same time, the public opinion has begun building confidence in
the current program. Lt has been widely agreed that the program is correct and could
bring the much-sought stability in the Turkish economy.

2.  However, we are observing that the recent political developments have
started to raise concerns over the sustainability of the current program in the period
ahead, and over the likelihood of endangering the benefits obtained from the economic
program. The program being implemented has been designed by considering the possible
non-economic shocks. Moreover, the recent structural reforms have İessened the
vulnerability of the economy to uncertainties and exogenous shocks.

3. Thanks to such structural reforms, fundamental institutional adjustments have
been made so as to minimize election-oriented economic policies that are in
contradiction with the continuation of economic stability. Dt should also be kept in mind
that, in the current floating exchange rate regime, any shortsighted, politically
motivated and destabilizing action that has no economic foundation can be guülckly
mirrored in the market sentiment. Therefore, it is not rational to pursue economic
policies that are focused on economically unjustified short-term gains.

4.. Markets should bear in mind that the amendments made in the Central Bank
Law, and the new Borrowing Law are among the most important structural reforms.
According to the new Central bank Law, achieving price stability has become the
Central bank's primary objective, and the Central Bank may use its monetary policy
instruments freely in order to realize this objective. In this context, the Central Bank
has been setting its monetary policy having price stability in mind only in recent years,
and has been informing the public opinion of monetary policy implementations as much
transparent as possible.
5. Abandoning this program, which is about to bringing the stability in Turkish
economy by İaying the foundation of a sustainable growth, seems to be against the
public interests. For this reason, the fiscal discipline envisaged in the current economic
program must be preserved, and the structural reforms must be sustained. This is
compatible with Turkey's short-term and İong-term interests. In other words, we have
no other option but to strictİy adhere to the fundamental principles of the current
program in the medium-term.

6. Another significant indicator of the determination in the successful
implementation of the program, which is gradually yielding tangible results, is the stage
at which the Banks Re-capitalization Program executed by the Banking Regulation and
Supervision Agency has reached. This operation will contribute to achieving a
permanent recovery and stability of the financial system. This is especially important,
since financial stability is vital for the efficiency of monetary policies aiming at price
stability. The Central Bank has taken the necessary measures for providing İiguidity to
the banks under the Re-capitalization Program by considering that financial stability is
a main factor supporting price stability. I1t is no doubt that these arrangements will
decrease the mood of uncertainty for the banking sector.

7.In addition, as of end-June, all structural and operational decisions have been
taken by the Parliament and the Gövernment within the framework of the current
economic program. Ln this context, the IMF Executive Board is expected to meet on 28
June 2002 and to decide on the release of the credit tranche.

8. For the reasons stated above, the Central Bank does not expect an
interruption in the program due to non-economic developments. The more guülckly all
sections understand this point, the more rapidiy the volatility in the markets will
disappear. Lt is thought that there is no reason why we should not reach the year-end
inflation target of 35 percent, if the program is implemented as planned without
encountering an unexpected shock. İt is expected that the market sentiment will keep
up its positive trend with the elimination of political uncertainties emerged in the
second half of May. The Central Bank is maintaining its positive outlook for the period
ahead.

B. FOREIGN EXCHANGE BUYING AUVCTLON PROGRAM FOR JULY

9. By considering the reverse currency substitution and the better than
expected balance of payments position, the Central Bank has been conducting planned
FX buying avctions since April in order to build up the Central Bank reserves with the
excess FX supply by avoiding an extra volatility in exchange rates. We are observing a
slow-down in the reverse currency substitution, which we consider it to be temporary,
due to recent mood of political uncertainty. The balance of payments, on the other
hand, is expected to improve. İn this context, although we are considering to continue
the planned FX buying auctions in the next weeks, it has been decided to temporarily
suspend the planned FX buying auctions starting from 151 Tuly 2002, by taking into
account of the reduced volume of the FX transactions, from time to time, and somewhat
artificial price formation in the FX market. İn case of the resumption of the planned
FX buying auvctions, we will announce it accordingly.

C. TL DEPOSİT BUYING AUVCTTON PROGRAM FOR JULY

l0. With the aim of increasing the efficiency of Turkish lira sterilization
operations, the Central Bank will continue conducting 4-week TL deposit buying
auctions in July, which were initiated in April 2002 in the Interbank Money Market.
İn this context, the TL deposit buying auvctions will be held every week on Wednesdays
and Fridays in July, and the total amount offered in each avction will be TL 200
trillion at the most.

l11. The Central Bank will continue using the monetary policy instruments
effectively, in öorder to preserve the benefits of the current economic program, to
achieve price stability, and to ensure the smooth operation of the financial system. TL
İllguidity in the markets will be regulated by using money market instruments at hand.
However, if any difficulty emerges in the effective use of these instruments, İiguidity
might also be sterilized through planned FX sales, as stated in the Letter of İIntent.

D. LATELİĞUİDİTY WIİINDOW

12. As has been announced in the Press Release of 2 January 2002 titled
“Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy in 2002 and Prospective Developments", the
Central Bank will, as the lender of last resort, initiate (O/N) the implementation of
“late liguidity window” in the İnterbank Money Market between 16:00-16:30 as a new
TL liguidity facility from 1st July 2002. Banks may borrow unlimitediy from "İate
İlguidity window” at CBRT's offer rate against collateral, or may lend money to the
Central Bank at CBRTs bid rate.

13. Starting from 1 July 2002, the CBRT's offer rate for "İate liguidity window”
is set as 65 percent between 16:00-16:30, while there is no change in the CBRT's
borrowing guotation of D percent. The CBRT's (O/N) borrowing guotation of 48
percent announced between 10:00-16:00, öone-week borrowing guotation of 49 percent,
and (O/N) lending rate of 55 percent have been left unchanged.

14. Moreover, as has been previousİy announced, although it is expected that
markets will maintain their long positions in TL in the next period, the TL liguidity that
might be needed as a result of an unexpected development will be met by intra-day
repo auctions.
