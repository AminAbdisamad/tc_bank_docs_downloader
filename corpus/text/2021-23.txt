Press Release on the New Name of the 
Survey of Expectations  
11 June  2021  No: 2021 -23 
 
The name of the Survey of Expectations  which has been implemented by the Central Bank of the 
Repub lic of Turkey (CBRT) since 2001,  has been changed to the “Survey of Market Participants” in 
order to avoid any misunderstanding in the public and the press that the survey  indicates the 
CBRT’s institutional expectations and forecasts . The Survey of Market Participants covers financial 
and real sector professionals’ short and long -term expectations/ forecasts regarding the main 
macroeconomic variables suc h as inflation, exchange rates,  growth and interest rates.  
The methodology and publication date o f the Survey of Market Participants remain  unchanged.  
Accordingly,  it is underlined once again that the results of the Market Participants Survey do not 
reflect the CBRT's own f orecasts and expectations, and  this sur vey is compiled from the 
estimates of financial and real sector professionals . 
Detai led information about the survey is ava ilable at  link.
