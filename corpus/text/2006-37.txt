Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) adopted a formal infla tion-targeting framework at the 
beginning of 2006. The general framework of monetar y policy was explained in the policy 
statement dated December 5 th  2005. Accordingly, the end-year annual inflation t arget for 2006 
was set as 5 percent. The CBT has also disclosed a quarterly path of inflation for 2006 consistent 
with the end-year target with an uncertainty band o f 2 percentage points on both sides (Table 1).

Figure 1 shows the target path and the actual infla tion outcomes. The target for 12-month 
CPI inflation in June 2006 was set at 6.5 percent, with an upper limit of 8.5 percent. The actual 
outcome for 12-month inflation in June 2006 is 10.1 2 percent. As stipulated in Article 42 of the 
Central Bank law, the CBT will provide the Governme nt with a written statement explaining the 
reasons for inflation exceeding the upper limit of the uncertainty band and the measures to be 
taken to ensure that inflation rate will return to levels within pre-established limits. This open 
letter serves this purpose. As mentioned in our pol icy statement titled “General Framework of 
Inflation Targeting and Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2006” published on December 
5, 2005, the public announcement to be made in such  a case will also be presented to the IMF as 
part of the program conditionality.

Under the inflation targeting regime, monetary poli cy is based on a medium term 
perspective in which the main goal is to ensure the  consistency of medium term inflation 
forecasts-and expectations- with the multi year tar gets. The main communication device is the 
quarterly Inflation Report. We have published our f irst inflation report in January 2006 along 
with quantitative inflation forecasts. Following th e most recent literature on inflation targeting, 
we based our forecasts on an endogenous policy path  in which the CBT reacts to the deviations 
of projected inflation from the targeted path. Cons istent with this approach, we have made it 
explicit that underlying our January forecast was a  policy rate path that would be constant in the 
first couple of months of 2006 and gradually ease t hereafter. Under this scenario, our end-year 
2006 inflation forecasts pointed to a range between  4.7 percent and 6.3 percent, which was 
inside the uncertainty band of 3-7 percent with a s afe margin. 
 
The forecasts in the Inflation Report suggested tha t annual inflation would start to 
decline gradually in the second quarter of 2006 aft er exhibiting a slight increase in the first 
quarter due to some base effect. In the Inflation R eport of January 2006, the CBT had identified 
two major risks to the forecast: First, it was argu ed that the forecasts were based on a constant 
oil price path and thus further increases in the oi l prices might lead to higher inflation than 
projected. Second, we mentioned the possibility of a reversal in global liquidity conditions and a 
decline in global risk appetite, both of which had been favorable for emerging markets in the last 
couple of years. 
 
Reasons for Breaching the Target 
 
The main reasons for inflation exceeding the upper limit of the uncertainty band in June 
2006 can be attributed to a combination of several supply shocks. The first four months were 
dominated by rising oil prices, increases in the to bacco product prices, high unprocessed food 
price inflation and the continued increases in the gold prices. It is important to note that, despite 
these adverse supply factors, inflation expectation s were well behaved in the first 4 months of 
2006 (Figure 2).                                                                                        Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey

12-month ahead inflation expectation in April was a round 5.4 percent, close to our 
medium term targets. Annual change in the CPI exclu ding the most volatile items such as 
unprocessed food, tobacco-alcohol, energy and gold was on a declining trend (Figure 3); with an 
annual change of 5 percent by the end of March, sug gesting that the rise in headline inflation 
was likely to be temporary and that underlying infl ation trend was much lower than the actual 
headline inflation. Moreover, the sustained decreas e in the risk premium in the first quarter 
supported the policy action of further monetary eas ing. Although the domestic demand 
indicators were pointing to a robust recovery, ther e were no signs of overheating in the overall 
economic activity. Various indicators, such as capa city utilization rates, working hours in the 
manufacturing industry and the output gap estimates  pointed the absence of capacity pressures 
in the economy. All these observations suggest that  supply factors played a dominant role in 
rising inflation.

 This outlook has allowed the Monetary Policy Commit tee (MPC) to stick to the policy 
path underlying the January forecast and the policy  rates were cut by 0.25 percentage points in 
the April meeting. April inflation figures, which c ame out a couple of days after the policy rate 
cut, turned out to be much higher than market expec tations. However, as mentioned above, a 
closer look at the April figures revealed that infl ation was mostly due to supply-side factors such 
as unprocessed food, gold and energy prices. 
 
Nonetheless, the overall market sentiment began to shift in May, as global liquidity 
conditions started changing in favor of developed c ountries. Higher global risk aversion has 
triggered capital outflows in many emerging markets  such as Turkey, Hungary and South 
Africa. In other words, one of the major risk facto rs we have mentioned in our Inflation Report 
was realized. Turkey has witnessed a sudden deterio ration in the credit risk premium (measured 
by the EMBI spread) by around 150 basis points duri ng May and June and the New Turkish Lira 
depreciated more than 20 percent against the US$ in  the meantime. 
 
The direct impact of the exchange rate pass-through  was visible through items such as 
gold, petroleum products and electrical appliances etc. in May. Moreover, the unfavorable 
course of unprocessed food and international gold p rices continued in May. As a consequence 
annual inflation rose to 9.86 percent. Our computat ions point to a direct pass-through impact of 
around 0.6 percentage points in May and another 0.9  points in June. In other words, had the 
exchange rate not moved in the last two months, ann ual inflation in June would have been 
around 8.6 percent—not 10.12 percent. Therefore, th e outer band would have been most likely 
breached with a small margin even in the absence of  the recent exchange rate movements. 
 
How did the Monetary Policy Respond? 
 
Coupled with the aforementioned supply shocks, depr eciation of the domestic currency 
has led to deterioration in inflation expectations (Figure 2). 12-month ahead inflation 
expectations increased by almost 2 percentage point s in two months. What is more, the 24-
month ahead expectations worsened by about 1 percen tage point. These developments have 
indicated that the impact of depreciation on prices  might go way beyond a relative price 
adjustment, calling an immediate policy response. C BT reacted decisively by holding an 
extraordinary MPC meeting on the 7 th  of June in which the policy rates were hiked by 17 5 basis 
points. The decision was well received and helped t he markets to calm down. 
 
In the ordinary meeting of the MPC dated June 20, t he Committee assessed that the 
information flow between 7 th  and 20 th  of June did not justify a change in the policy sta nce and 
decided to keep the policy rates on hold. Neverthel ess, markets turned more unstable and 
inflation expectations deteriorated sharply in the following days, calling for immediate action. 
As a response, the MPC held another extraordinary m eeting on the 25 th  of June 2006 to assess 
the developments and to discuss the measures to be taken. Members of the Committee have 
reached a consensus on the view that; although the extent of the market instability did not reflect 
the true economic fundamentals, it had the potentia l to further worsen the expectations and thus 
threaten the medium term inflation targets. The res ponse of the MPC was a rate hike of 225 
basis points, reaching a total of 400 basis points tightening in June.                                                                                       Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey  
 The CBT not only tightened by increasing the policy  rate but also by withdrawing the 
excess YTL liquidity in the financial markets throu gh a combination of one and two week 
deposit purchase auctions and FX sales in order to reduce the excess New Turkish Lira liquidity 
in the overnight money market, while raising the le nding rate up by a total of 600 basis points. 
By doing so, the CBT has also aimed at easing the e xcess volatility in the financial markets 
originating from factors that are independent from economic fundamentals. Hence, the CBT has 
explicitly demonstrated its commitment to the mediu m term inflation targets. 
 
Markets reacted positively to this package, with lo wer bond yields possibly reflecting a 
reduction in inflation uncertainty. Table 2 shows t he CBT overnight borrowing rates set at each 
of the 2006 meetings of the MPC.

Medium Term Inflation Outlook  
 
The CBT conducts monetary policy based on the evalu ation of the future trend of 
inflation. In assessing future inflation, the CBT u ses the best available information, both 
quantitative, using structural models, simulations and other statistical measures, and qualitative 
which demands a more subjective analysis. Taking th e monetary policy measures in June into 
account and assuming that the monetary policy will preserve its prudent stance, this section of 
the letter evaluates the medium term outlook of inf lation. 
 
While the recent volatility in the financial market s is expected to slow down the 
domestic demand growth, the depreciation of the dom estic currency is likely to have a favorable 
impact on net exports. However, it is expected that  the slowdown in domestic demand will 
surpass the rise in net foreign demand, leading to an overall decline in the aggregate demand for 
home goods. In other words, the net effect of the r ecent volatility on the aggregate demand is 
expected to support the disinflation in the second half of the year 2006. In light of these 
assessments, the output gap is expected to widen fo r the remainder of the year (Figure 4). The 
economic activity is projected to pick up gradually  in the medium term. 
                                                                                       Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey

Forecasting the course of inflation in the near ter m requires an assessment of the pass-
through impact of recent movements in exchange rate s. Although empirical evidence shows that 
exchange rate pass-through has been significantly r educed after the adoption of floating 
exchange rates, our studies suggest that the impact  on the price of tradable goods may still be 
sizeable. Using the techniques developed by our sta ff, our computations point roughly to a 
cumulative of 3.5 percentage points of pass-through  impact on headline CPI inflation throughout 
2006. It is noteworthy to emphasize that, we contem plate the impact of exchange rate on 
inflation to take the form of a change in relative prices between tradable and non-tradable goods 
rather than price readjustments. In such a case, ov erall impact on inflation will be temporary so 
long as the medium to long-term expectations are un der control. 
 
At this point, it will be helpful, using a hypothet ical case, to illustrate the typical 
behavior of the price level, monthly inflation and the annual inflation upon an exchange rate 
shock in the absence of second round effects. Assum ing that exchange rate exhibits a one-time 
shift at period zero, Figure 5 depicts the price le vel and inflation paths induced by the direct 
pass-through effect. Note that even if there are no  second round effects, the change in headline 
index induced by the relative price adjustments (fi rst order effects) may take several months. 
Our example assumes a 6 months adjustment period (p ossibly due to staggered price setting in 
the economy). This lagged pass-through dynamics is also consistent with the Turkish case in 
which most of the direct impact is completed in 6 m onths. 1

Two main results can be deduced from this exercise:  (i) As long as the second round 
effects are negligible, the impact of a one time ju mp in exchange rates on inflation is bound to 
be temporary. (ii) Provided that the impact on the price level dies out in T months (6 months in 
our example), monthly inflation is affected for T m onths while annual inflation stays above the 
steady state for T+12 months (18 months in our case ); therefore, ceteris paribus , it will take 18 
months for the annual inflation rate to return to t he target. This simple observation explains why 
it may take more than a year to bring annual  inflation down after a significant exchange rate 
shock.  
Our recent policy responses should be interpreted a s an intention to realign inflation 
expectations, to avoid the propagation of supply sh ocks, and to inhibit a generalized increase in 
prices. Accordingly, we expect the monetary tighten ing to contain the second-round impact of 
the recent exchange rate movements on 2007 inflatio n, partly due to the slowdown in the overall 
economic activity. Although the implied inflationar y inertia may still add another 1 percentage 
point to the headline CPI inflation in 2007, our ai m is to keep this effect at a minimum level. 
 
Against this background, our latest forecast constr ucted using a constant policy rate 
suggest that inflation will be between 9.1 and 10.5  percent at the end of 2006 with 70 percent 
probability (Figure 6). Besides the slowdown in dom estic demand, we expect that unprocessed 
food prices will normalize (which already showed si gns of normalization in June), the one-off 
increases in tobacco prices will disappear and the impact of exchange rate pass-through will 
gradually fade out in the medium term. We project t he annual inflation to come down after the 
first quarter of 2007, the downward trend becoming more significant in the second half of the 
year. Inflation is expected to converge to the targ et around one and a half to two years time. The                                                                                       Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey  
 forecast indicate a range between 3.5 and 7 percent  for end-2007. Given that this forecast is 
created under the constant rates assumption, adhere nce to the 4 percent target may require some 
further policy tightening.

* Current forecasts are based on information as of July 10 th , and thus, may differ from the 
forecasts in the July Inflation Report, which will be published on the 28 th of July. The shaded 
region indicates the 70 percent confidence interval  for the forecast. 
 
 
Note that, that the chance of inflation staying wit hin the shaded region is 70 percent, i.e. 
there may be breaches around the baseline projectio ns, especially in the presence of large 
shocks. One such risk is the possibility of a susta ined rise in oil prices. The CBT will 
accommodate the first order effect of oil shocks, w hich mainly works through energy and 
transportation prices. However, the CBT will monito r the pricing behavior closely and will not 
hesitate to react to any deterioration in medium te rm inflation expectations. 
 
Latest developments have signaled that, a shift in investor confidence originating from 
changes in expectations or swings in the global ris k appetite are among major risk factors for the 
medium term forecasts. Should such a risk realize a nd the exchange rate exhibit significant 
fluctuations, the CBT will act in line with its med ium-term approach: It will not react to changes 
in relative prices, but stand ready to respond to a ny deterioration in medium term inflation 
expectations. Also, in such a case the excess liqui dity in the market will be managed carefully to 
dampen the potential volatility in the financial ma rkets.

 Conclusion 
 
In sum, breaching the upper bound of the uncertaint y band of inflation target in June 
2006 can be attributed to two major developments. F irst, one of the risk factors we have set out 
in our inflation reports, namely the change in the global liquidity conditions, has been realized. 
Second, there have been unexpected increases in the  volatile prices such as unprocessed food, 
gold and energy prices. Although, the relatively st rong course of the domestic demand might 
have been one of the factors affecting inflation, a  careful analysis of the price data and capacity 
indicators suggests that the role of the supply fac tors in breaching the target, by and large, was 
dominant.  The CBT has already responded vigorously  to bring inflation back to the targets. Our 
recent forecasts suggest that medium term targets a re attainable under a cautious monetary 
policy stance. However, it should be carefully note d that, these assessments are made within a 
context where the fiscal discipline is not relaxed,  the income policy is in line with the inflation 
targets and that expectations are managed properly.  
 
The current macroeconomic framework in Turkey is bu ilt on three fundamental pillars: 
inflation targeting, floating exchange rate regime and prudent fiscal policy. This framework has 
proven to be effective in dealing with the sequence  of shocks to the Turkish economy, keeping 
inflation - and inflation expectations - under cont rol. The Central Bank of Turkey remains 
attentive to developments in the economy in both do mestic and external fronts. Our end year 
2007 and 2008 targets remain as 4 percent. As in th e recent past, the CBT will react promptly to 
events that would endanger the achievement of the p olicy targets.
