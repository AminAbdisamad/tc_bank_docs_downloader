OCTOBER INFLATION AND OUTLOOK  
  
I. GENERAL EVALUATION  
  
1.   In October 2002, the prices increased in line with market 
expectations. CPI increased by 3.3 percent, while WPI increased by 3.1 percent. 
Thus, the overall increase in January -October period became 24.0 percent in 
CPI and 25.5 percent in WPI. The downward trend in annual inflation continued, 
CPI and WPI rose by 33.4 percent and 36.1 percent respectively on a year on  
year basis.  
  
2.  The relative stability in exchange rate in the last three months, and the 
sluggish domestic demand continued to have a favorable effect on the course of 
inflation also in October 2002.  
  
3.   High increases in food and clothing prices d ue to seasonal factors have been 
the main determinants of the increase in consumer prices in October. WPI was 
affected adversely due to an increase of 8.1 percent in agricultural prices, being 
the highest October rate in the last 5 years. However, being th e lowest October 
rates since 1983, the rate of increase in manufacturing industry and energy 
prices limited the increase in WPI. In October, CPI excluding food rose by 2.9 
percent while WPI excluding agriculture rose by 1.8 percent.

4.     The inflation measure, which is calculated by using 3 -month moving averages 
of seasonally adjusted CPI and WPI decreased in October as in September and 
reached 31.4 percent in WPI and 28.4 percent in CPI. The annual inflation 
became 32.7 percent in WPI excluding agriculture, and 27.0 percent in CPI  
excluding food.

Developments in Consumer Prices  
  
5.   The increase of 3,3 percent in CPI mainly stemmed from the rise in food and 
clothing prices due to seasonal factors. When food and clothing items are 
excluded from the CPI, the rate of increase falls down to 1,7 percent. 
Seasonally adjusted price increase in CPI continued to decline in October and 
realized at 1,7 percent dropping by 0,3 percent compared to the previous month. 
Especially the limited increases in housing and households had  an effect on this 
decline. Both sectors experienced the lowest October price increases 
throughout the last nine years. There was no significant increase in seasonally 
adjusted food, beverages and tobacco prices, which had showed an upward trend 
starting f rom June. The highest increase was in clothing and shoe sub -item.  
  
6.  Seasonal price increases in food and clothing groups led to an increase by 4,2 
percent in the prices of goods in October. The rate of increase in the rents 
slowed down compared to Sep tember, being realised as 2,6 percent. Due to 
considerably lower increases in the prices of services excluding rents, inflation 
remained at level of 1,5 percent in services group in general. Seasonally adjusted 
rate of increase of goods and services prices  were realised as 1.8 percent in 
October, showing a slowdown compared to the previous month. As of October, 
the annual inflation dropped to 34 percent for goods prices and to 32,5 percent 
for service prices.

7.    CPI excluding food rose by 2,9 percent due to the increase in clothing 
prices by 12,7 percent. The said increase in clothing prices led to an acceleration 
of seasonally adjusted CPI excluding food compared to the previous month. 
Nevertheless, the increase on a yearly basis continued to decline and the annual 
increase in CPI excluding food dropped to 33,7 percent (Figure 3).

Developments in Wholesale Prices  
  
8.  In October, seasonal factors have affected the rate of increase in WPI by 
1,2 percentage points.  Moreover, seasonally adjusted wholesale prices that had 
showed an upward trend startin g from May turned into a downward trend in July 
and maintained this tendency in October as well. Despite the negative impact of 
8,1 percent increase in agricultural prices on WPI, the 1,8 percent increase in 
manufacturing industry prices has limited WPI. T he slowdown in agricultural 
prices by 10,7 percent in April -August period has reversed and agricultural 
prices contributed to WPI inflation by 0,1 percent and 1,8 percent in September 
and October, respectively.  
  
9. Public manufacturing industry prices rec orded its lowest rate of increase 
since February. The slowdown in the rate of increase in public prices and the 
stability of the Turkish lira in the last months also limited the rate of increase 
in private manufacturing industry prices, which dropped to it s lowest level in the 
last seven months. Owing to these developments, seasonally adjusted WPI 
increase, which began slowing down starting from August, maintained this trend 
in October as well, and realized at 1,9 percent. Meanwhile, increase in WPI 
excludi ng agriculture declined from 2,9 percent in September to 1,8 percent in 
October.

 II. OUTLOOK    
 
10.  Success in the fight against inflation in 2002 was achieved together with 
favorable developments in the other economic data. At first, a 3 percent GNP 
growth that was predicted for 2002 i n the beginning of the year seemed 
unattainable to markets. As a matter of fact, while the expected growth in GNP 
for 2002 was 2,7 percent in January, it dropped to 2 percent in April. However, 
the rate of growth in the first half of the year reached 4,7 p ercent. Taking this 
recovery in account, GNP growth projection for 2002 was revised up to 4 
percent in October. In addition, improvement in expectations for capacity 
utilization ratio, industrial production index and general outlook in the economy 
points o ut that the growth rate will even raise above 4 percent at the end of the 
year. In fact, according to CBRT Expectation Survey published in November, 
markets raised their growth expectations for 2002 to 4,3 percent.  
 
11.  It is evident that the main reason of favorable developments both in 
inflation and in other economic variables, despite the perception of political 
uncertainty that intensified in May, is the elimination of economic fragility 
through structural reforms as well as tight fiscal and monetary p olicies. In fact, 
despite political uncertainty, the Central Bank announced clearly by press 
releases of 28 June 2002 and 5 August 2002 that the outlook for future was 
favorable for two reasons. First, the fulfillment of the majority of structural 
reforms would decrease the fragility of economy against uncertainties and 
external shocks. The second reason was the high probability of implementing the 
program uninterruptedly, taking its successful results into account which had 
put an end to concerns on its su stainability, by bringing stability in the markets. 
However, a slight deterioration was observed in the public finance and delays 
occurred in some structural adjustments due to political elections.  
 
12. 2002 fiscal  and monetary policies and structural refo rms made under the 
current program were crucial in making progress on the way to price stability 
and the inflation has rapidly come down. CPI inflation, which was 68,5 percent at 
the end of 2001, came down to 33,4 percent in October, which is the lowest level of the January 1988 â€“ October 2002 period.   Current developments 
indicate that CPI inflation will remain below the target of 35 percent.  
 
13.  According to the results of Expectation Survey, markets are expecting the 
annual inflation figure to drop t o 32,3 percent in the first period of November 
(Figure 5). In addition to favorable inflation expectations for 2002, the 
expectations for the next 12 months also displayed a stable downturn. According 
to the results of first period of November, inflation e xpectation for the next 12 
months declined to 26,5 percent.  
 
14.  Continuation of success achieved in lowering inflation in 2002 will depend on 
taking urgent measures for recovering the recent deterioration in public finance 
and delays in structural reform s, and will depend also on the strict 
determination in pursuing structural reforms and fiscal discipline in 2003. 
Determination in these areas will further improve expectations and will have a 
positive effect on the determinants of inflation. Considering t hat short -term 
interest rates will continue to be set only within the framework of price 
stability target, complying with the basic principles of the current program will 
facilitate the fight against inflation and ease its pressure on the economic 
growth.  
 
15.  It will be helpful to underline a number of risks that might adversely affect 
the inflation developments in the short -term. It is probable that especially food 
and agricultural prices might increase due to Ramadan and religious holiday, in 
contrast t o the downward trend observed in the previous period. In addition, the 
highest increase recorded in agricultural prices in October since February and 
the fact that the increase in agricultural prices has not yet been reflected on 
food prices can be conside red as a development that might lead to rapid rise in 
food prices. Another factor that may have an unfavorable impact on inflation is 
the probability of a relative acceleration in public prices.  
 
16.  Meanwhile, in addition to the policies of the public se ctor, the incomes and 
pricing policy of private sector also will continue to bear importance on the fight 
against inflation as in the past. Therefore, private sector should formulate its 
incomes and pricing policy in line with the inflation target. The inc rease in 
demand that might arise as result of removal of uncertainties and restored 
confidence must not be considered by private sector as an opportunity to 
increase profit margins. It is very important for reducing the cost of 
disinflation.
