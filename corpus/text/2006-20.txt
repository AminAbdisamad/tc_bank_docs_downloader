The Monetary Policy Committee has decided  to  cut  short-term interest rates 
(policy rates)  applied at the CBRT Interbank Money Market and the Istanbul Stock 
Exchange Repo-Reverse Repo Market as follows:  
a) Overnight Interest Rates:  The CBRT borrowing interest rate is reduced 
from 13.50 percent to 13.25 percent, and the CBRT lending interest rate is reduced 
from 16.50 percent to 16.25 percent.  
b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates:  Within the framework of the Late 
Liquidity Window Facility, the CBRT overnight borrowing interest rat e applicable 
between 4:00 p.m. – 4:30 p.m. at Interbank Money Market is decreased to 9.25 
percent  from 9.50 percent. Lending interest rate is decreased to 19.25  percent from 
19.50 percent. 
c) The interest rates applicable to overnight and one-week maturity  borrowing 
facilities provided for primary dealer banks via repo transactions w ithin the 
framework of open market transactions are reduced to 15.25  percent from 15.50 
percent. 
The Monetary Policy Committee has concluded that recent developments do 
not significantly change the medium-term outlook elaborated in the Infl ation Report 
published in January. In the recent period, economic growth displayed a sta ble trend, 
investments and increases in productivity continued while secondary effe cts of the 
prices of oil and other commodities remained limited. When items suc h as energy, 
unprocessed food and alcoholic beverages-tobacco that are beyond the control of  
monetary policy are excluded, the general trend of inflation is obser ved to be 
downwards. Annual inflation is expected to display a downward trend from t he 
second quarter of the year onwards. However, the cautious approach in moneta ry 
policy should be maintained in view of the continuation of price increases  in the 
services sector, the weakening contribution of demand conditions to inflati on and the 
persisting high and volatile oil prices. Moreover, the international li quidity conditions 
are being closely monitored. 
In the light of currently available information, policy rates are less likely to 
increase, rather than decrease or remain stable in the medium-te rm. It should be noted 
that new data will be monitored carefully in the near-term. This policy perspective 
will ensure that inflation is in line with the target path around m id-2007. Meanwhile, 
it should be emphasized that any new data and information associated wi th the 
inflation outlook will potentially lead the Monetary Policy Committe e to revise its 
future stance. 
 A broader summary of the assessments of the Monetary Policy Com mittee 
will be published within five working days.
