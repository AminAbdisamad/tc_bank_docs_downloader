The Monetary Policy Committee has decided to cut short-term interest rates
(policy rates) applied at the CBRT Interbank Money Market and the Istanbul Stock
Exchange Repo-Reverse Repo Market as follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: The CBRT borrowing interest rate is reduced
from 13.50 percent to 13.25 percent, and the CBRT lending interest rate is reduced
from 16.50 percent to 16.25 percent.
b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Within the framework of the Late
Liquidity Window Facility, the CBRT overnight borrowing interest rate applicable
between 4:00 p.m. – 4:30 p.m. at Interbank Money Market is decreased to 9.25
percent from 9.50 percent. Lending interest rate is decreased to 19.25 percent from
19.50 percent.
c) The interest rates applicable to overnight and one-week maturity borrowing
facilities provided for primary dealer banks via repo transactions within the
framework of open market transactions are reduced to 15.25 percent from 15.50
percent.
The Monetary Policy Committee has concluded that recent developments do
not significantly change the medium-term outlook elaborated in the Inflation Report
published in January. In the recent period, economic growth displayed a stable trend,
investments and increases in productivity continued while secondary effects of the
prices of oil and other commodities remained limited. When items such as energy,
unprocessed food and alcoholic beverages-tobacco that are beyond the control of
monetary policy are excluded, the general trend of inflation is observed to be
downwards. Annual inflation is expected to display a downward trend from the
second quarter of the year onwards. However, the cautious approach in monetary
policy should be maintained in view of the continuation of price increases in the
services sector, the weakening contribution of demand conditions to inflation and the
persisting high and volatile oil prices. Moreover, the international liquidity conditions
are being closely monitored.
In the light of currently available information, policy rates are less likely to
increase, rather than decrease or remain stable in the medium-term. It should be noted
that new data will be monitored carefully in the near-term. This policy perspective
will ensure that inflation is in line with the target path around mid-2007. Meanwhile,
it should be emphasized that any new data and information associated with the
inflation outlook will potentially lead the Monetary Policy Committee to revise its
future stance.
A broader summary of the assessments of the Monetary Policy Committee
will be published within five working days.
