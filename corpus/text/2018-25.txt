Press Release o n the Maximum Interest 
Rates for Credit Cards in Q 3 2018  
30 June  2018, No: 201 8-25 
 
The monthly maximum contractual interest rate for the credit card borrowings has been revised 
as 2.02 percent for the Turkish lira and 1.62 percent for foreign exchange transactions, whereas 
the monthly maximum overdue interest rate will be 2.52 percent for the Turkish lira and 2.12 
percent for foreign exchange transactions, to be effective from 1 July 2018.  
 
Banks in Turkey, as is the case in other countries, charge higher interest rates for credit card 
borrowing than they do for consumer loans. The CBRT, therefore, advises credit card holders with 
short -term credit needs to seek a  consumer loan rather than borrowing on personal credit cards.
