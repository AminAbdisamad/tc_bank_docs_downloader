Rates for Credit Cards in Q 4 2018  
16 September  2018, No: 201 8-40 
 
The monthly maximum contractual interest rate for the credit card borrowings  has been revised 
as 2.25 percent for the Turkish lira and 1. 80 percent for foreign exchange transactions, whereas 
the monthly maximum overdue interest rate will be 2. 75 percent for the Turkish lira and 2. 30 
percent for foreign exchange transactions, to  be effective from 1 October  2018.  
 Banks in Turkey, as is the case in other countries, charge higher interest rates for credit card borrowing than they do for consumer loans. The CBRT, therefore, advises credit card holders with short -term credit needs to  seek a consumer loan rather than borrowing on personal credit cards.
