GENERAL FRAMEWORK OF INFLATION TARGETING
REGIME and MONETARY AND EXCHANGE RATE POLICY
FOR 2006

Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey
DECEMBER 2005

TRANSITION TO INFLATION TARGETING REGIME
Introduction
1. Inflation targeting is a successful monetary policy regime implemented not only in
developed but also developing countries. The number of countries which have
adopted inflation targeting have been increasing steadily. The Central Bank of the
Republic of Turkey (Central Bank) emphasized in its announcement of early 2002
pertaining to the general framework of monetary policy that the final target of
monetary policy was the adoption of inflation targeting regime, but as the
reliability of the regime would suffer in case this adoption was made prematurely –
without satisfying the necessary pre-conditions – first there will be a waiting
period to allow the factors that restrict the efficiency of monetary policy to
weaken. It was also pointed out in the same announcement that “implicit inflation
targeting” would be implemented until the adoption of the inflation-targeting
regime. In line with this, inflation targets were set jointly with the government.
While utilizing short-term interest rates efficiently in the fight against inflation,
base money was set as an additional anchor with a view to increasing the reliability
of inflation targets. This policy, supported by fiscal discipline, ongoing structural
arrangements and the progress made towards Central Bank independence, paved
the way for significant gains on the road to price stability.
2. In time, harmonization with the floating exchange rate regime increased and
considerable progress was made in the formation of a suitable environment for the
transition to an inflation targeting regime: all inflation targets were met, confidence
was heightened and inflation expectations converged with the targets. Today,
inflation is at its lowest in thirty years. While debates on the sustainability of
public debt stock used to be at the top of the economic agenda in the past, this is no
longer the case. Worries pertaining to the continuity of fiscal discipline have eased
considerably. Financial markets started to become deeper, and the financial sector
has become less fragile.
3. Progress made towards economic stability started the reverse-dollarization process,
and although it was interrupted from time to time and more progress is necessary,
the weight of Turkish lira denominated investments began to increase in portfolio
preferences.

1

4. In the same time-span, six zeros were dropped from the Turkish lira and New
Turkish Lira (YTL) was adopted. This step, we refer to as monetary reform, was a
demonstration of our trust in the permanent nature of the gains achieved.
5. Following the agreement with the IMF, the announcement of the medium-term
program and the start of the negotiation process with the European Union for full
membership, the predictability of fundamental macroeconomic variables further
increased.
6. During the period 2001-2005, very significant steps were taken pertaining to the
improvement of the institutional infrastructure of monetary policy, and this is
another pre-condition for the transition to the inflation-targeting regime. During
this process, the Central Bank rendered its institutional framework more efficient,
defined its communications policy in a more transparent way, expanded its
information set and improved its inflation forecast methods. Besides these factors,
significant progress was made during this time in the area of Central Bank
independence, pertaining to its practice. This development strengthened
expectations that the chronic inflationary process will not return.
7. All these developments pointed to the fact that the pre-conditions of the inflationtargeting regime had, to a large extent, been met and the appropriate time was
approaching. The Central Bank did not adopt the regime in 2005 due not only to
the changes made by the Turkish Statistics Agency in the price indices released by
the agency, but also to the monetary reform that took place. Yet, the Central Bank
announced that this was the final preparation period for the transition to the
inflation-targeting regime. Steps taken in this preparation period for further
institutionalization of monetary policy brought the practice of monetary policy
strategy one step closer to the inflation-targeting regime. In the said period,
Monetary Policy Committee meetings began to be held at pre-set and preannounced dates and times, and interest rate decisions – taking into account the
deliberations made at the meetings - began to be made public at 9 a.m., the next
day. Such meetings were followed by the prompt release of a text outlining the
rationale behind the decisions as well as providing the opinions of the members of
the Monetary Policy Committee. These texts not only justify the immediate
decisions but also provide signals for the future course of interest rate decisions. In
addition, during the same period the organizational structure of the institution was

2

renewed and the terms of reference pertaining to monetary policy were clarified.
As a result, during the last four years, and especially during the last year, the
predictability

of

monetary

policy

evidently

increased,

and

significant

developments took place pertaining to institutional infrastructure and transparency.
8. The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey will begin to practice the regime of
inflation targeting, within the framework of the institutionalization process of
monetary policy in 2006. Together with this regime, it is planned to move towards
the process of “price stability” from the “disinflation” process of recent years.
Within this context, there will be increased transparency and accountability in the
upcoming period, in terms of inflation targets and the policies for reaching these
targets, within the general framework of monetary policy. This press release
should be perceived as a main policy text for the framework of the inflationtargeting regime.
THE GENERAL DEFINITION OF INFLATION TARGETING REGIME
9. The primary objective and main priority of central banks is to achieve and
maintain price stability. As for inflation targeting, it is a monetary policy strategy,
becoming more widely used with the aim of achieving price stability. Although
there are various definitions in academic literature, practices point to two main
factors differentiating the inflation targeting regime from other regimes:
i.

The central banks implementing an inflation-targeting regime announce their
inflation targets numerically, commit themselves to achieving these targets
and are accountable to the public in case targets are not attained.

ii.

As monetary policy decisions affect on the economy with a time lag, central
banks control future inflation rather than current inflation. With this aim,
they develop inflation forecasts periodically and make them public. That is
why the inflation-targeting regime is also frequently called “inflation forecast
targeting”. Along the same lines, the consistency of the forecasts with the
inflation target and the risk of deviating from the target are explained to the
public.

10. The monetary policy implemented in Turkey has gradually approached the
inflation-targeting regime. Following the new steps to be taken in 2006 regarding

3

transparency and accountability, the current monetary policy of that time will from
then on be described as the inflation-targeting regime. Analysis of other countries,
as well as Turkey’s past experiences suggest that the inflation targeting regime is
not an end in terms of monetary policy, but on the contrary, a component of an
uninterrupted “evolution” process. Certainly, this evolution process holds true for
not only the policy makers, but also for all the other economic units. Enhanced
mutual interaction and information sharing with the public during this process will
render the regime more functional and efficient. In line with this, the main items on
the agenda for the Central Bank in the upcoming period will be to raise the level of
transparency, accountability and predictability. The fundamentals of monetary
policy in the coming period are summarized below.
THE GENERAL FRAMEWORK OF INFLATION TARGETING REGIME IN
TURKEY
11. The Central Bank has been working on the inflation-targeting regime since the
year 2000. The experiences of more than 20 - developed or developing - countries
implementing the inflation targeting regime were used while constructing the main
framework of the regime for Turkey. The country examples showed that, there is
no system, which is “the unique and the best for all countries”. Therefore, it has
been taken into consideration that a model specific to Turkey needs to be formed
while constructing the general structure within the framework of an inflationtargeting regime.
Inflation Target and the Period of Targeting
12. Owing to the advantage of being easily understood by the public, as well as its
communication advantage, the inflation target was set as “a point target”. As it is
an indicator easily followed by all members of society and an effective way of
accurately measuring the cost of daily life, the Consumer Price Index was the
preferred means of defining the inflation target. Along these lines, the target
variable is the end-year rate of inflation calculated by the annual percentage
change of the Consumer Price Index with the base year 2003. Bearing in mind the
transition from 2006 onwards to a three-year budget practice, the announcement of
a three-year target path is believed to increase the internal consistency of inflation
targets and their harmony with other macroeconomic projections. Therefore,

4

during this initial stage of the inflation-targeting regime, targets are announced for
a three-year period. In harmony with the Pre-Accession Economic Program and
three-year budget plans, the end-year targets for 2006, 2007 and 2008 are set as 5
percent, 4 percent and 4 percent, respectively. The target for end-2009 will be
announced in 2006.
Interpretation of the Target
13. End-year inflation targets for the period of 2002-2005 were announced within the
framework of implicit inflation targeting, and inflation was realized below the
targets for the first three years in a row. It is predicted that the realization for 2005
will most probably be below the target as well. Under normal conditions where
inflation has stabilized at low levels, it can be considered as unfavorable for
inflation to remain systematically below the target. However, as the primary
objective while moving from the chronic inflation environment to single-digit
figures in the 2001-2005 period was to bring down the high level of inflation,
remaining below the target did not affect expectations adversely. On the contrary,
it bolstered perceptions that the disinflation process would continue. Hence, in this
period, the fact that inflation was below the targets was considered to be a more
acceptable situation compared to inflation realizing above the targets. Within this
context, the targets announced by the Central Bank were implicitly perceived as
the “upper limit”. However, it is inevitable that this situation will change in the
coming years. This is due to the fact that in economies where inflation has
stabilized, monetary policy is in a position to aim for the coherence between
inflation and the targets, rather than inflation realizing below the targets. Along
these lines, in the process of the inflation-targeting regime, the Central Bank will
from now on assess upward or downward deviations from the target on equal
footing. This also means that an explanation will be made to the public in both
substantial upward and downward deviation of inflation from the target.

Deviation from the Target and Accountability
14. Measured by the Consumer Price Index, which is a comprehensive index, the
course of inflation may show fluctuations arising from the factors outside the

5

control of monetary policy. Factors such as developments in oil prices, changes in
international liquidity conditions and global risk perceptions, indirect tax and
public price adjustments, and unforeseen movements in the prices of unprocessed
food may lead to volatilities in inflation from time to time. Considering the data
and model uncertainty in the economy in addition to the factors mentioned above,
it is obvious that inflation realization is quite unlikely to be exactly the same figure
as the point target That is why it is not possible for the Central Bank to ensure that
inflation will not make even the slightest deviation from the point targets.
15. However, this does not stand for the lack of accountability. In case of a significant
deviation from the target in any period, the Central Bank shall explain the reasons
behind the said development to the public in its reports, in the framework of the
inflation-targeting regime. In this context, the Central Bank will continuously be
obliged to account for its actions to the public through the publication of its
reports. Nevertheless, it is of paramount importance that the Central Bank
establishes a separate mechanism, which will explain the situation to the public in
cases where inflation realizations display an excessive deviation from the target.
Thus, the provision in Article 42 of the Central Bank Law states that “The Bank
shall submit information to the Government in writing and inform the public
disclosing the reasons of incapability to achieve the determined targets in due time
or the occurrence of the possibility of not achieving such targets and the measures
to be taken thereof.” As the said article provides accountability, it shall be
implemented with utmost care in the framework of the inflation-targeting regime.
16. At this point, the main question to be answered is how to establish this mechanism.
As it is stated explicitly in paragraph 14, the probability of achieving the point
target is almost zero. In this case, will the accountability principle also apply to a
small deviation, which can be defined in decimal or even in percentage points?
How big should a deviation be in order to require such an explanation? It is clear
that size matters however the perception of size is much more important.
Determination of the size of the deviation stands for the expression of an
“uncertainty band” per se. The critical point is that this band should not be
perceived as a band for the inflation target.

6

17. Building a band around the target is an implementation preferred by most of the
central banks that adopted inflation targeting and announced a point target.1 The
fact that central banks build a band around the point target does not indicate a slack
monetary policy. It should be emphasized once more that the uncertainty band
should not be perceived as any type of target. It is only an indicator for the bidirectional and “excessive deviation” thresholds of the band target, which was
announced for 2006, and an element that facilitates the communication policy of
the Central Bank. In the overall scenario in which big exogenous shocks do not
occur, the public should understand clearly that the aim of the Central Bank is to
be as close to the point target as possible and therefore, the Bank will consider
upward and downward deviations from the 5 percent-target in the same manner.
Furthermore, it should be noted by the economic agents that the uncertainty band is
likely to shrink as a result of further approaching price stability in the upcoming
years.
18. In light of the statements above, the “uncertainty band” for 2006 is set as 2percentage point in both directions. The inflation path consistent with the end-year
target and the uncertainty bands around the path are shown below. In case figures
go outside the band, the Central Bank shall submit a separate report to the
Government disclosing the reasons of the incident and the measures to be taken
thereof and share this report with the public.

Adoption of a Medium-Term Perspective
19. There is a close relation between building an uncertainty band and a “mediumterm perspective”. In order to minimize macroeconomic fluctuations while
struggling against the exogenous shocks that increase or decrease inflation
remarkably, we need an “uncertainty band” around the point target to serve as a
reference. Rather than temporary fluctuations in inflation, what matters to the
Central Bank in the medium-term is that inflation becomes 5 percent in one year
and 4 percent in two years by displaying a gradual decline and achieves a degree of
stability. It should be noted that a medium-term inflation target stands out in such
an implementation. In a medium-term perspective, the Central Bank does not
instantly react to the temporary impacts of large exogenous shocks on inflation, but
spread out the policy reactions over a period of time by putting emphasis on
medium-term targets. In this context, the Central Bank will clearly explain to the
public how a shock that threatens the inflation target is handled (such as the
evaluation of temporary or permanent features of a shock). In the framework of
Article 42 of the Law mentioned in paragraph 15, the Central Bank will not only
implement policies aimed at reconvergence to the target but also notify the
political authority of the steps to be taken and inform the public of the amount of
time needed for converging to the target again.
20. For instance, it is a widely accepted idea that central banks should not have a
reaction to the primary effects of an increase in oil prices. However, as the
implementation of this idea requires certain flexibility, an uncertainty band should
be built around the target.
21. Let us explain this matter with an example: In a scenario in which oil prices rise by
USD 100 per barrel and maintain their high trend throughout 2006, their primary
impacts on inflation might reach 3 or 4 points and naturally, the Central Bank
would let the end-2006 inflation exceed the 5-percent target. In case the Central
Bank strived to reach the 5-percent target in 2006 in spite of the supposed increase
in oil prices, the Bank might be obliged to increase interests significantly and
therefore, cause a negative impact on social welfare by creating a contraction in
economic activity. Instead of this, the Central Bank in the supposed situation,
would allow the deviation from the 2006 target, but pledge to decrease the inflation
to 4 percent in 2007 in order to prevent secondary effects and keep expectations

8

under control. A similar action plan could be followed against probable
developments such as changes in international liquidity conditions, adjustments in
indirect taxes and public prices, pricing differentiations of institutions stemming
from structural adjustments and sudden movements in agricultural product prices.
22. The important point here is that in the periods where inflation deviates from the
target, the Central Bank clearly explains the reasons for the deviation to the public
and informs them of the timing of re-convergence to the target and the relevant
monetary policy. There is no doubt that the said time band may differ according to
the type and size of shocks. As various shocks may have different impacts on
inflation according to timing and periods, in case of a significant diversion from
the target, the re-convergence period shall be announced after the occurrence of the
shocks and the determination of their sources.
Special CPI Aggregates
23. The CPI occasionally displays unpredictable changes as a result of fluctuations in
energy, unprocessed food and public prices and in indirect taxes. Therefore, the
CPI inflation, which is taken as the target criteria in the framework of the inflationtargeting regime, may occasionally be affected by factors that are beyond the
control of monetary policy. For this reason, in order to achieve a better
understanding of the main inflation trend, Special CPI Aggregates (SCA) will
continue to be a part of the forward-looking inflation analysis of the Central Bank
and its communication policy. As the shocks affecting inflation may differ
according to their periods, there is a very small probability that a sole “core
inflation” indicator excludes all the factors that are outside the control of monetary
policy. Therefore, instead of considering a single so-called core indicator, more
than one indicator is used in the differentiation of various exogenous shocks. There
is no doubt that some of the said indicators may stand out in the future. However,
for now, core inflation it is not likely to be defined with a single indicator. In this
process, the Central Bank will openly inform the public of the type of relevant
indicator and the degree of its importance. Moreover, after reaching a satisfactory
number of observations, new indices can be compiled based on different
techniques and SCA definitions can be updated according to the changing
economic conditions.

9

Conditions for Changing Targets
24. A pre-announced inflation target shall only change in the event that very sharp and
long-term deviations from the target are expected or medium-term targets no
longer make sense due to factors beyond the control of monetary policy. At this
point, a new target will be set with the Government with respect to the Law.
25. Temporary shocks can change inflation forecasts rather than inflation targets. For
instance, even though a one-off adjustment in indirect taxes diverts inflation from
the targets, a change in the target will be out of the question due to its limited
effect on one-year ahead inflation forecasts. Instead, the short-term forecasts will
be changed. In this case, the points of reference to be used by economic agents will
be inflation forecasts for the short term and the inflation target for the medium
term. In conclusion, it is fundamental in the upcoming period that the targets do
not change except in cases of extraordinary developments.
Public Sector’s Role in the Inflation Targeting Regime
26. Sound monetary policy is a necessary condition on the way towards price stability,
but not sufficient. In order to attain price stability, the continuity of fiscal
discipline should be maintained in the upcoming years as in past years. In Turkey,
fiscal discipline has the potential to affect the inflation-targeting regime through
four channels. The first channel comprises long-term expectations. Further
enhancement of fiscal discipline through its continuity will increase the
effectiveness and predictability of monetary policy by extending the borrowing
maturities and reducing the risk premium and the volatilities in risk premiums and
contribute to the credibility of the inflation targeting regime.
27. The second channel works through the prices of goods and services produced by
the public sector itself. Naturally, the consistency between the prices of goods and
services produced by the public sector and inflation targets is crucial for attaining
price stability.
28. The third channel works through the incomes policy of the public sector. One of
the main determinants of the expectations for price and wage inflation in Turkey
are the wage increases made by the public sector to its own employees. In this

10

context, the consistent trend of the incomes policy with the inflation target is a sine
qua non for the success of the inflation-targeting regime.
29. The fourth channel is the direct spending channel. The public sector’s direct
purchases of goods and services are reflected on inflation via total demand. The
powerful position of these channels indicates the critical importance of the
continuity of fiscal discipline in a period where the memories of chronic inflation
are still fresh. In conclusion, continuity of fiscal discipline and consistent
implementation of fiscal policies with targets are fundamentals in the success of
the inflation-targeting regime.
Inflation Targeting Regime and IMF Conditionality
30. With the adoption of the inflation-targeting regime at the beginning of 2006, in the
scope of “IMF Program Requirements”, Net International Reserves will continue
to be performance criteria, however performance criteria for Money Base and the
indicative target for Net Domestic Assets will be replaced with the “inflation
consultation criteria”. To this end, from 2006 onwards, a path will be established
consistently with the end-year target at the beginning of every year and this path
will be used for the revisions made with the IMF within the framework of the
program. As of the end of 2005, the inflation figures consistent with the end-year
target are calculated for end-March, June, September and December; and the
figures, which are set out in paragraph 18, appeared in the Letter of Intent.
31. Graph 1 shows the quarterly path of inflation consistent with the end-year target of
2006, which was prepared to be used in reviews within the framework of the
agreement signed with the IMF. The specified path has been formed by taking into
account factors such as base effect and seasonality. The path for 2007 is going to
be formed at the end of 2006.

32. As seen in Graph 1, revision criteria around the target-consistent path are
established. For each quarterly period, if inflation remains below or above the
target-consistent path by one or more points, there will be negotiations with IMF
staff in each review. In case of such a development, the Central Bank will inform
the public of the causes of the deviation via the issue of periodical reports.
33. If inflation falls below or exceeds the target-consistent path by two or more points,
since such a fall or rise will be considered as a violation of the program
conditionality, the Bank will announce the measures to be taken within the
principles of the program. These measures will also serve the principle mentioned
above in the part concerning accountability, which reads: “In case of a two-point
deviation in the target-consistent path in either direction, the Central Bank will
prepare a separate document that will serve to inform the public of the causes and
measures to be taken, and also provide the Government with a written statement”.
The public announcement to be made in case of a likely violation of the program
conditionality will also be presented to the IMF and thus a certain level of
transparency will have been established.

12

34. There is a critical point that needs special emphasis: The program conditionality
outlined above does not mean that monetary policy will focus on quarterly periods.
The path designed within the framework of the program will have relative
significance in evaluating the consistency between the yearly course of inflation
and targets, and the Central Bank will maintain its medium-term perspective in
making monetary policy decisions. For instance, if it is anticipated in January 2006
that a significant deviation from the target-consistent path will be observed in
March, this anticipation will be shared with the public, while monetary policy will
not react as long as the inflation outlook is consistent with medium-term targets.
Inflation Report and Forecasts
35. With the transition to the inflation-targeting regime, the quarterly issued Inflation
Report will be the main communication instrument of monetary policy. In 2006
dates of issue of the Report have been determined as the last weeks of January,
April, July and October. The first issue of the Report will be released at the end of
January 2006. The Monetary Policy Report, which has been issued quarterly, will
not be issued in the new period.
36. In the Inflation Report, inflation and general macroeconomic developments will be
discussed in depth. The greatest change in the Report will be the inclusion of the
inflation forecasts of the Central Bank. In case of a change in the forecasts of a
previous Report, the new Report will provide information explaining why updated
forecasts differ from those of the previous period. Moreover, the Report will also
contain signals of likely future policies along with a general evaluation of the
factors influencing inflation. In this way, a significant step will have been taken
towards ensuring transparency and accountability stipulated by the inflationtargeting regime.
37. There is no doubt that the process of forming monetary policy and inflation
forecasts involves many uncertainties due to exogenous shocks or the continuous
transformation process in the economy. The said uncertainties apply to all
economies in the world but are much higher in economies such as Turkey that
undergo a structural transformation. It is inevitable that all these likely shocks and
uncertainties will influence inflation forecasts. In this context, it is extremely
important that the public becomes aware that forecasts reflect the stance the

13

Central Bank takes about inflation during the issue period of the Report. Therefore,
inflation forecasts may change in line with unexpected developments that can
emerge during the time between the two reports as well as with any new
information acquired. What is more noteworthy here than the change in forecasts
itself is that causes of the change will be clearly explained to the public through the
Inflation Report. In other words, the Central Bank will always be liable to be called
to account.
Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
38. Along with the Inflation Report, minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee
meeting will also be a significant instrument of communications policy in the
inflation-targeting regime. The Inflation and Outlook Report, which has served a
similar purpose so far, will be replaced with a dual reporting system: Immediately
after the monetary policy decision is made, a brief report on the decision and its
rationale will be issued. The other report summarizing the evaluations of the
Monetary Policy Committee and its stance about the inflation outlook will be
issued within five working days following the meeting.
Other Instruments of Communication
39. Press conferences and presentations will constitute another significant instrument
to be used in the context of the communications policy in the inflation-targeting
regime. The Central Bank will share the general framework of the inflationtargeting regime with the public through presentations it will give in universities
and non-governmental organizations from time to time. On the date of release of
the Inflation Report in January 2006, the content of the Report will be outlined in a
press conference. Every succeeding quarter, the main message of the Inflation
Report will be conveyed to the public once again in a press conference.
40. Technical reports issued by the Central Bank, notes that would enable better
perception of the transmission mechanism and presentations about the methods
used in inflation forecasts will form another pillar of the communications policy. A
forecasting and policy analysis system has already been developed within the
Central Bank in order to support monetary policy decisions. However, the Central
Bank will not rely on a single model at this stage. The Bank believes that due to

14

uncertainties in the functioning of the transmission mechanism and the rapidly
changing structure of the economy, it would not be reasonable to stick to a single
model and it is important in monetary policy decisions that various models with
various assumptions are evaluated together in light of the views of specialists.
Academic literature and central banking experiences are also in consensus on the
above-mentioned views. For this reason, no specific model will be put forward at
this stage. As a matter of fact, many developing countries like the Czech Republic,
Poland and Brazil did not develop any models during the first years of inflation
targeting, either.2
41. So far, the Central Bank has at times shared its views about the functioning of the
economy with the public through various presentations, reports and working
papers. Although it has become clearer compared to previous periods, the
transmission mechanism in Turkey still harbors a significant level of uncertainty
like other country examples. Nevertheless, the Central Bank has to share its
economic views with the public as a necessity for transparency principle. In this
respect, the Central Bank will continue to share its views with the public about the
effects of monetary policy on inflation through reports and presentations. In
addition, studies in this direction will continue at an accelerated pace and
information as to how inflation forecasts are made within the Central Bank will be
shared with the public in stages.
42. It is of critical importance that the public properly follows and evaluates the
reports and other documents issued by the Central Bank, particularly after the
transition to the inflation-targeting regime in 2006. An example will be helpful
here: Following the announcement of inflation figures for October 2005, some
remarks were made by the public claiming that “the Central Bank acted more
cautiously in October since inflation figures were above the expected level”. In
order to increase the effectiveness of economic policies, the short-term point of
view underlying such remarks should be abandoned as soon as possible and our
reports should be followed closely. As a matter of fact, the preceding Inflation and
Outlook Report had anticipated there would be high price increases in October. For
this reason, this development was not taken as a new and significant piece of

2

Schaechter Andrea, Mark R. Stone, and Mark Zelmer (2000): “Adopting Inflation Targeting: Practical Issues
for Emerging Market Countries”, IMF Occasional Paper, No 202

15

information in the monetary policy decision made in November. Factors that affect
the level of the Central Bank’s cautiousness are projections about the consistency
between targets and the outlook of inflation in the medium-term, rather than
seasonal price increases in certain goods in any month.
Decision-Making Process
43. After the transition to an inflation-targeting regime, the Monetary Policy
Committee will assume a “decision maker” role instead of an “advisor” role.
Unless an emergency arises, the Monetary Policy Committee will continue to meet
once a month in 2006 as it has done since 2001, as stipulated by Central Bank
Law. Unlike 2005, meeting dates will not fall on the same day each month.
However, in line with the principle of transparency, meeting dates for the whole
year will be announced to the public in advance. As can be seen in the meeting
dates of 2006 listed in the Annex, meeting dates are arranged so as to coincide with
the second half of each month. Meeting dates have been determined by taking into
account such factors as official holidays, national and religious festivals, the data
flow process in a month and announcement dates of national income data. In the
upcoming period, inflation projections will be renewed and the Inflation Report
will be issued quarterly, following the announcement of national income figures.
Hence, four of the twelve Monetary Policy Committee meetings held in a year will
coincide with the release of the Inflation Report.
44. In the new period, meetings will be held in two sessions between 2.00 pm and
5.00 pm. The first session will host Central Bank authorities and specialists as well
as authorities from the Undersecretariat of Treasury. In this session, related bodies
of the Central Bank and authorities of the Undersecretariat of Treasury will present
to the Monetary Policy Committee their reports on evaluations about economic
developments, which will then be opened to discussion. In the second session, to
be held on the same day, members of the Monetary Policy Committee will make
the final evaluations about the outlook and put the decision to a vote. After the
voting is concluded, members of the Monetary Policy Committee will prepare a
brief report explaining the rationale of the decision. The decision and its rationale

II.

EXCHANGE RATE POLICY, FX BUYING AUCTIONS AND

LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT

Exchange Rate Policy and FX Buying Auctions
45. On 20 December 2004, the Central Bank shared with the public the general
framework of the current exchange rate policy and FX buying auctions in a press
release called “Money and Exchange Rate Policy in 2005”. According to this;
i.

The economic transformation process experienced after the 2001 crisis has
enabled significant achievements in macroeconomic stabilization and helped
reduce the “dollarization” effect created by unstable macroeconomic policies
and high inflation in the past. The main tendency of economic agents has
been to hold increasing amounts of Turkish currency denominated assets
since 2002. This “reverse dollarization” process, combined with favorable
developments in the balance of payments, has supported the increase in
foreign exchange supply in the economy.

ii.

Taking into account the likely contribution of a strong foreign exchange
reserve position to boost confidence in the current program, foreign debt
payments of the Treasury and the need to gradually reduce the number of
high-cost remittances accounts in the long-term, which are peculiar to
Turkey and make up a significant part in the liabilities side of the Central
Bank’s balance sheet, the Central Bank held foreign exchange buying
auctions to build up reserves at times where foreign exchange supply
constantly increased compared to foreign exchange demand. Foreign
exchange buying auctions, which have been held since 1 April 2002, also
continued in 2003 and 2004 at bands as long as market conditions allowed.

iii.

The main principles of a floating exchange rate regime are that the exchange
rate is not used as a monetary policy tool and the Central Bank does not have
any exchange rate target. That is why the Central Bank, which follows a
moderate reserve-raising strategy, makes foreign exchange purchases via
auctions, whose terms are announced in advance, in order to affect the supply
and demand conditions in the foreign exchange market and thus the level of

17

exchange rate at a minimum level and to abide by the basic principles and
functions of a floating exchange rate regime.
iv.

In the light of its prediction that the introduction of a new three-year
economic program involving primarily fiscal and monetary discipline and
structural reforms and the favorable developments in the process of
negotiations aimed at full membership to the European Union will have a
positive effect on both the reverse dollarization process and the balance of
payments, the Central Bank announced that it will resume foreign exchange
buying auctions, which had been suspended for a period of time, effective
from 22 December 2004. Moreover, the Central Bank has decided to
announce an annual program in order to minimize the impact of foreign
exchange auctions on foreign exchange. The Central Bank has also decided
not to make any amendments to the program, unless extraordinary
differences are observed in foreign exchange liquidity.

v.

Meanwhile, it was emphasized once again that the Central Bank will
continue to closely monitor the volatility in exchange rates and will directly
intervene in the markets in the event of excessive volatility that might occur
in either direction. It was also underlined that volatility interventions are not
only carried out by considering past data with a mechanical rule, but by
evaluating the causes of realized and potential volatility in all aspects.

46. With respect to foreign exchange buying auctions held in 2005, it was announced
on 20 December 2004 that the Central Bank would buy maximum USD 45 million
in daily foreign exchange auctions, with USD 15 million of auction amount and
USD 30 million of optional selling amount (200 % of the total amount sold). These
amounts were not changed throughout the year. At foreign exchange buying
auctions, which commenced as of 22 December 2004, USD 7,1 billion in total was
bought until 2 December 2005. At a total of 231 auctions held during the said
period, the average buying sum amounted to USD 30.9 million.
47. Furthermore, the Central Bank intervened in the foreign exchange markets six
times in 2005 due to excessive realized or expected volatility in exchange rates.
Within the transparency framework, which is a prerequisite for the implemented
monetary and exchange rate policies in and has, the Central Bank has started to
announce the data relating to direct foreign exchange buying/selling interventions
18

in the section “Data/Financial Markets Data/Foreign Exchange Buying-Selling
Interventions Against TRL” of its web site (www.tcmb.gov.tr) starting from 21
October 2005.
48. In 2005, net foreign exchange purchases through auctions and interventions
became USD 21.5 billion by 2 December 2005. The amount of net foreign
exchange purchases by the Central Bank since 2002 is shown on an annual basis in
the following Table. The sum of foreign exchange purchases in 2005 is the highest
amount that has been bought by the Central Bank in a calendar year to date. Hence,
the amount of net foreign exchange purchases reached USD 37.5 billion in the
2002- 2005 period.

49. The economic program and the accession to the European Union, are expected to
have a favorable effect on both the reverse dollarization process and the balance of
payments. The general framework for exchange rate policy implementation
announced in our press release of 20 December 2004, which is summarized in
Article 45, will be valid for 2006. In other words, it was decided to carry on daily
foreign exchange buying auctions, predicting that foreign exchange supply will
continue to pursue a high course in 2006. The amount of daily buying in auctions
will be raised to USD 20 million from USD 15 million in 2006. Unless
extraordinary differences in foreign exchange liquidity are observed, the program
will remain the same.
50. Guidelines for foreign exchange auctions are as follows:

19

i.

The total daily amount of auctions is determined as USD 20 million for
2006, starting from 2 January 2006.

ii.

Auctions will not be held on public holidays of the United States, even if it is
a working day in Turkey. Neither will auctions be held on half working days
or if when the Central Bank has started to intervene in foreign exchange
market prior to auction hours.

iii.

The additional optional selling amount priced over the average price of the
auction will only be granted to the winner parties. The optional amount will
be 200 percent of the total amount sold in the auction by each bank.
Accordingly, the maximum daily amount that can be bought will be USD 60
million, with USD 20 million of auction amount and USD 40 million of
optional selling amount.

iv.

The auction number will be posted on Reuters page CBTQ at 1.30 p.m. and
institutions may bid between 1.30 – 1.45 p.m.

v.

After the auction results are posted on the CBTQ page of Reuters, the
institutions may exercise their right to sell the optional amount till 2.00 p.m.

vi.

The other rules for the foreign exchange buying auctions have not changed
and will be applied as before.

vii.

On the other hand, the CBRT may, with prior notice, suspend the auctions
temporarily in cases where the depth of the foreign exchange market has
been lost and thus there is excessive volatility in exchange rates, in addition
to when unhealthy price formation is observed due to a serious exogenous
shock or unforeseen extraordinary developments.

51. In conclusion, exchange rates will continue to be determined by supply and
demand conditions in the foreign exchange markets in 2006 as well. The key
determinants of foreign exchange supply and demand are the monetary and fiscal
policies and the economic fundamentals determined by the structural reform
process and expectations. Undoubtedly, the deteriorations in economic
fundamentals and adverse developments in the stability program and expectations
may lead to volatility in exchange rates. It should be borne in mind that in a
floating exchange rate regime, economic agents operate in an environment of
exchange rate risk. Nevertheless, as repeatedly emphasized by the Central Bank,
20

exchange rate risk is a manageable risk and economic agents should establish the
mechanisms that will enable the efficient management of this risk.
52. The Central Bank had announced in its press release of 2 January 2002 titled
“Monetary Policy and Exchange Rate Policy in 2002 and Prospective
Developments” that it would gradually strip itself of its intermediary function in
Foreign Exchange and Banknotes Markets and would keep up its intermediary
function only for the foreign exchange deposits of the state-owned banks that were
taken over from the Savings Deposits Insurance Fund (SDIF) banks. However,
foreign exchange deposits of state-owned banks, which were transferred to them
from SDIF banks and used by these banks in the CBRT Foreign Exchange and
Banknotes Markets, will be closed as of 26 December 2005 and the intermediary
operations of the Central Bank in Foreign Exchange and Banknotes Markets will
end as of the said date. On the other hand, banks will be able to borrow foreign
exchange in terms of USD and euro from the Central Bank within predetermined
limits with a one-week-maturity at the Foreign Exchange and Banknotes MarketForeign Exchange Deposit Market in the coming period. Moreover, the
transactions of purchase/sale of ”foreign exchange against foreign exchange”,
“foreign exchange against foreign banknotes” and “foreign banknotes against
foreign banknotes” conducted between the Central Bank and institutions
authorized to operate in the Foreign Exchange and Banknotes Markets will
continue.
Liquidity Management
53. Following the February 2001 crisis, the Central Bank purchased government
securities worth TL 14 quadrillion from state-owned banks and banks transferred
to the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund (SDIF) in order to meet their liquidity
needs. The intensive purchase of foreign exchange in 2003 and 2004 and the
purchase mentioned above created a substantial amount of excess liquidity in the
market during the 2001-2004 period. The Central Bank sterilized the excess
liquidity in the market in an active manner, by means of Turkish lira deposit
operations in the Interbank Money Market and reverse repo transactions carried
out within the framework of open market operations in the Repo and Reverse Repo
Market of the Istanbul Stock Exchange. Accordingly, overnight interest rates were

21

steadily realized at the level of the borrowing rate of the Central Bank. Within this
framework, the borrowing rate of the Central Bank has become an indicator for
money markets.
54. In its press release, “Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy in 2005”, dated 20
December 2004, the Central Bank had announced that the excess liquidity
observed in the 2001-2004 period would gradually shrink in 2006, based on the
main scenario, even it was not possible to make an accurate prediction for the
entire amount of the Central Bank’s foreign exchange purchases and the
Treasury’s net foreign exchange borrowing.

Furthermore, the liquidity

management strategy to be followed in case of liquidity shortage was explained in
detail.
55. Accordingly, the Central Bank did not allow any excessive volatility in money
market rates, when a liquidity shortage appeared from time to time. The Central
Bank efficiently met the liquidity requirements of banks through repo auctions and
the liquidity facilities offered to the primary dealers. However, even if temporary
liquidity shortages were experienced, the excess liquidity conditions continued
throughout the year as a result of Central Bank’s foreign exchange purchases via
foreign exchange auctions and direct buying interventions, far above the amount
foreseen under the main scenario. The amount of excess liquidity in the market
reached YTL 6.6 billion by 2 December 2005.
56. According to available data, for the rest of this year and 2006;
i.

The rise in demand for base money,

ii.

Coupon and principal redemption by the Treasury to the Central Bank,

iii.

The increase in Treasury accounts will have a lowering effect on the amount
of liquidity, while

i.

The Central Bank’s net foreign exchange purchases,

ii.

Interests payments to be made by the Central Bank for reserve requirements
and for excess liquidity absorbing transactions,

iii.

The utilization of the Treasury’s net foreign exchange inflows for the
reimbursement of TL borrowing will have an increasing effect on liquidity.

57. Unlike the previous periods, the Treasury’s income-expenditures balance in terms
of foreign exchange will have a more significant effect on liquidity, since

22

privatization revenues and revenues from SDIF sales of assets will reach high
amounts. It is predicted that the part of these revenues, which will be transferred to
the Treasury accounts with the Central Bank, will primarily be in terms of foreign
exchange. Therefore, the Treasury’s foreign exchange transactions might not have
a decreasing effect on the liquidity in the market. In other words, in the rest of
2005 and in 2006, the income of the Treasury from privatization revenues and
SDIF sales of assets, and the amount of FX borrowing may cover the FX debt
repayment, including external and domestic debts, or it may lead to an insignificant
deficit, unlike in the previous years.
58. Therefore, as in the previous years, it is not possible to make a precise forecast
regarding the net foreign receipts of the Treasury and the Central Bank’s amount
of foreign currency purchases, which are the basic factors affecting liquidity.
Depending on the fluctuations of these amounts, the market liquidity can change
significantly. However, based on the assumption that the foreign exchange inflow
of the Treasury would match the foreign exchange outflow, and by taking the
Central Bank FX buying auction program into consideration, the continuity of
excess liquidity conditions in the markets in 2006 as well as the continuation of the
indicator status of the Central Bank borrowing rate, are most likely.
59. In the arrangements regarding the liquidity management strategy of the Central
Bank in 2006, some technical interest rate changes for narrowing the potential
volatility margins of the overnight interest rates are needed when the significant
decreases in the New Turkish Lira interest rates are taken into consideration.
However, such changes do not mean a change determined considering the inflation
target of the Central Bank. Because, in the current excess liquidity conditions, the
interest rate that the Central Bank determines for the daily borrowing transactions
is a benchmark interest rate and no change has been made in the aforementioned
interest rate to that end. In this context, the 2006 liquidity management strategy
will be as follows:
i.

The Central Bank will continue announcing overnight
borrowing and lending interest rates between 10.00 – 12.00
and 13.00 – 16.00 in the Interbank Money Market. In case of
a liquidity shortage during the day, banks can borrow at the
Central Bank’s lending interest rate within their limits. In case

23

of a fall in the interest rates as the result of increasing
liquidity, banks can make unlimited New Turkish Lira
deposits at the Central Bank borrowing interest rate. Also,
beginning from 2 January 2006, by lowering the lending
interest rate by 1 point, the spread between the borrowing and
lending interest rate which is currently 4 points will be
lowered to 3 points.
ii.

The Central Bank will continue to provide the Late Liquidity
Window facility between 16.00-16.30 such that banks may
borrow from the Central Bank against collateral without any
limit or lend to the Central Bank. Moreover, starting from 2
January 2006, the Central Bank (CBRT) lending interest rate
within the framework of the Late Liquidity Window facility
will be determined as 3 points higher than the daily lending
interest rate, and the borrowing interest rate will be
determined as 4 points lower than the daily borrowing interest
rate.

iii.

Especially during the periods of interest rate decisions, the
announcement made by the Central Bank’s on one-week
maturity borrowing interest rate leads the excess liquidity to
be absorbed by the Central Bank, which causes market
liquidity to decrease. Thus, there may be temporary
fluctuations in overnight interest rates. To prevent such
fluctuations, the Central Bank will not announce one-week
maturity borrowing interest rate at the CBRT Interbank
Money Market and at the Istanbul Stock Exchange Repo –
Reverse Repo Market starting from 2 January 2006.

iv.

In case of a temporary or permanent liquidity shortage, the
Central Bank will continue to carry out liquidity management
through one-week maturity repo auctions. When there is
liquidity shortage in the market, the Central Bank will
announce the amount of repo auction for that day on Reuters’
CBTF page at 10.00. While determining the amounts of the

24

auction, the Central Bank will endeavor to maintain the
average of auction interest rate at approximately 1 point over
the Central Bank daily borrowing interest rate announced at
the Interbank Money Market.

v.

The weekly repo auctions will be executed at 11:00 and the
results will be posted on Reuters’ CBTG page no later than
11:30. The traditional auction method will be used in
auctions, in other words the successful bidders will be
evaluated with their own rates.

vi.

In case of unforeseen excessive liquidity shortage, which
would exert excessive pressure on interest rates in the money
market during the day, the CBRT may announce “Intraday
Repo Auctions” in addition to the regular ones.

vii.

The Central Bank will continue to provide TRY liquidity to
the primary dealer banks through open market operations.
Currently, the overnight and one-week maturity interest rates
applicable to the repo facility provided to primary dealers are
determined 2 points higher than the Central Bank’s daily
borrowing interest rate. This facility will continue in 2006.
The primary dealer banks will be able to conduct repo
transactions between 10.00–12.00 and 13.00–16.00 hours.

viii.

In case of a permanent liquidity shortage in the banking
system, the benchmark short-term interest rate will be the repo
auction interest rate not the Central Bank’s daily borrowing
interest rate. Therefore, in case of a liquidity shortage, the
interest rate taken as a benchmark by the market would have
become higher due to the decline in liquidity. In order to
avoid any negative effects, the Central Bank could revise its
interest rates – even in cases where the Inflation Outlook
remains unchanged- so as to counter the pressure created by
the liquidity shortage. To reiterate, such a change in interest
rates would only mean a change stemming from liquidity
25

conditions- therefore such a move should not be perceived as
a loosening or tightening of monetary policy.
ix.

In case of a permanent liquidity shortage in the market, the
CBRT can terminate its transactions at the Istanbul Stock
Exchange Repo-Reverse Repo Market with a prior notice and
start to manage liquidity on its own markets, just like other
central banks. When the CBRT’s abovementioned liquidity
management strategy is taken into account, the termination of
CBRT transactions at Istanbul Stock Exchange Repo-Reverse
Repo Market is not expected to lead to any significant
fluctuations in market interest rates.

60. As stated in CBRT’s Press Release Regarding the Communiqués on Required
Reserves and Liquidity Requirement dated November 16, 2005, some new
arrangements have been introduced regarding required reserves and liquidity
requirement with the aim of helping banks make their liquidity management more
effective:
i.

With the termination of the liquidity requirement implementation, the banks
will no longer be obliged to hold government securities with the CBRT,
which will enable them to manage their liquidity more flexibly. This is an
important step towards the harmonization of financial regulations with the
acquis communautaire.

ii.

As of the end of 2005, the entire amount of TRY required reserves would be
maintained on average at free deposit accounts over a maintenance period
of 2 weeks. Currently, half of the TRY required reserves are obliged to be
kept on average at free deposit accounts over a maintenance period

of 2

weeks and the other half are held in blocked accounts. The new
implementation will enable the banks to manage required reserves more
flexibly at times of temporary liquidity shortage and help reduce fluctuations
in interest rates.
iii.

Meanwhile, the sanctions to be imposed in cases where banks fail to deposit
required reserves on time or fail to deposit in full amount have been revised.
Accordingly, the practice of collecting the penalty interest to be imposed for

26

default on required reserves liabilities in cash at once has been abandoned.
Instead, two-folds of the deficient TRY required reserve amount and threefolds of the deficient FX required reserve amount will be deposited in noninterest bearing deposit accounts. The aim of the new practice is to alleviate
the prospective unfavorable effects on financial bodies of the banks.
61. The Central Bank deems stability and deepening of financial markets as a
supporting objective for conducting policies pertaining to price stability
effectively. Actually, within the framework of the floating exchange rate regime,
the Central Bank has taken measures towards maintaining financial stability
several times in the last four years as it did in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks
in Istanbul in November 2003. Therefore, the Central Bank, whose primary goal
entrusted to it by law, is to establish price stability, will continue with its efforts
towards enhancing monetary policy and liquidity management in 2006.
Accordingly, the Central Bank may change both the liquidity management strategy
and interest rate margins in cases of unpredictable changes in market conditions
and according to new needs.
62. In our press release dated December 20, 2004, we had stated that liquidity was not
homogenously distributed in the banking sector, however the banking system was
expected to contribute to the development of secondary market operations by
taking into account risk management principles, with the ultimate aim of ensuring
liquidity flow to achieve a money market which functions effectively. Although
currently liquidity is not evenly distributed in the banking system, it is observed
that liquidity flow accelerated substantially in 2005 and money markets became
relatively more effective. The gradual improvement in this trend would not only
help increase the effectiveness of the monetary policy of the CBRT but also the
deepening of financial markets.
63. While on the one hand, tight fiscal and monetary policies implemented since 2001,
the structural reform process and increased confidence in the economic policies
has helped financial deepening and growth in the overall balance sheet of the
banking system, on the other hand these factors slowed down the rise in domestic
debt stock. Thus, a gradual and uninterrupted decline in the ratio of debt stock to
national income has been achieved. This development also helps reduce the share
of public debt stock in the total balance sheet of the banking system. Assuming

27

that fiscal discipline continued in 2006 and a substantial amount of privatization
proceeds were attained, it is estimated that this process would further accelerate.
The Treasury’s debt servicing ratio, which is lower compared to previous years,
would lead to a further decrease in fiscal dominance this year. Therefore, a rapid
rise in the banking system’s real sector and consumer credits and increased
competition and extension in maturities in the credit market are all developments
likely to occur.
64. Obviously, under the floating exchange rate regime the Central Bank is able to
implement the TRY liquidity policy in a more flexible manner than it can under a
fixed currency peg regime and can act more promptly and flexibly to meet the
TRY liquidity needs of the banking system. The Central Bank can prevent
excessive fluctuations in interest rates as long as they are consistent with the
inflation target. The abovementioned liquidity management strategy manifests this
fact very clearly. However, the banking system should not slacken risk
management principles by simply relying on the more flexible and effective
liquidity management of the Central Bank. Quite the contrary, it is obvious that
increased competition, credit volume and extended maturities would necessitate a
more effective risk management stance in the banking system.
