SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: November 11, 2010

Inflation Developments
1. In October, consumer prices were up 1.83 percent, while annual inflation was
down 0.62 percentage points to 8.62 percent due to base effects. Although
unprocessed food prices continued to soar dramatically, inflation remained
broadly subdued across all other subcategories. Annual services inflation
continued to decrease steadily, and core inflation indicators remained
consistent with medium-term targets.
2. Annual inflation in food and nonalcoholic beverages increased by 1.75
percentage points to 17.08 percent in October. Thus, food prices added 4.67
percentage points to annual inflation. Having soared in August and September
on escalating vegetable prices, unprocessed food prices continued to rise
sharply in October. Specifically, tomato prices increased sharply by 112
percent due to the supply shortage during the shift from field crops to
greenhouse crops, driving inflation up by 0.85 percentage points in October.
Meanwhile, unprocessed red meat prices continued to rise, albeit more slowly.
Accordingly, annual unprocessed food inflation climbed to an all-time high of
31.28 percent.
3. Bread and grains prices in the processed food group have recently been
affected by higher wheat prices. Moreover, prices for other processed food
products, especially processed meat products, have increased rapidly over the
past two months. The cumulative increase in both red meat and wheat prices
continues to put cost pressure on processed food prices.
4. Inflation in core goods and services remains contained. Although rising food
prices continues to weigh on catering services, prices for services other than
catering and transport remain flat for the third consecutive month. The base
effects from the 2009 tax incentives on durable goods faded out in October.
Thus, the annual rate of increase in prices of core goods (goods excluding
food, energy, alcoholic beverages, tobacco and gold) slowed to a record 1.25
percent. As a result, annual inflation captured by core price measures declined
to around 2.5 to 3 percent year-on-year.

5. Against this backdrop, the Committee expects the annual change of
unprocessed food prices to fall significantly in coming months. At the same
time, inflation is expected to decrease markedly as the influence of tobacco
price base effects diminishes during the beginning of 2011. Core inflation
might rise modestly in the forthcoming period, but is expected to remain
around levels consistent with the medium-term targets.

Factors Affecting Inflation
6. Recent data releases suggest that economic activity continues to recover with
the support of domestic demand. Industrial production grew by a seasonally
adjusted 1.2 percent quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter, recording a more
moderate recovery than in the first half of the year. Yet, in view of the rapid
recovery in domestic demand leading indicators, the Committee has stated
that the economy is set to regain momentum in the last quarter.
7. Confidence indices and new order indicators suggest that domestic demand
continues to recover. Three-month ahead expectations for total new orders
were more upbeat during September and October due to strong domestic
market conditions. Moreover, the Committee has noted that consumer
confidence continues to improve, while investment appetite has grown further
and stabilized at higher levels, and emphasized that domestic demand
continues to grow at a faster pace than foreign demand in the final quarter.
8. Uncertainties regarding external demand persist. Exports remained subdued
in October, while indicators for export orders showed no sign of a strong
recovery in the short term. Furthermore, there remain downside risks to the
pace of recovery in the global economy. Therefore, the Committee expects
that it would take a long time before industrial capacity utilization rates return
to their pre-crisis levels, due to the weak external demand outlook.
9. Although employment conditions continue to improve, unemployment rates
remain at high levels. Non-farm employment growth paused in the third
quarter, owing to the slowdown in the services sector. Committee members
have noted that labor market developments are consistent with the thirdquarter slowdown in production, and expect that employment growth will
resume in line with the end-year economic recovery. Nevertheless, the
Committee has reiterated that unemployment rates would remain higher than
pre-crisis levels for some time, containing unit labor costs.
Monetary Policy and Risks
10. The Committee expects the weakening in the economic activity and
employment indicators in the third quarter to be temporary. According to the

Committee members, especially credit volume and domestic demand follow a
strong trend, nevertheless aggregate demand conditions do not exert upside
pressures on inflation yet due to weak external demand. Moreover, the
Committee has indicated that 5 percentage points of inflation, which was at
8.62 percent as of October, can be attributed to the direct effects of the
unprocessed food and tobacco prices, which are both expected to decelerate
in the forthcoming period. Therefore, it is expected that inflation would be on a
declining path in the forthcoming period, while core inflation indicators would
remain consistent with the medium-term targets. In light of these assessments,
the Committee has reiterated that it would be necessary to maintain the policy
rate at current levels for some time, and to keep it at low levels for a long
period.
11. Although aggregate demand conditions support the stance of keeping policy
rates at low levels for a long period of time, the developments in the
composition of the demand necessitates the active use of other policy tools.
The weakness in global economic outlook not only delays the recovery in the
external demand but also leads to further expansionary policies across
developed economies, which in turn fuels domestic demand through the
acceleration in capital inflows to emerging markets. The surge in capital
inflows exacerbates the divergence between the growth rates of domestic and
external demand, widening the current account deficit through rapid credit
growth and increasing import demand, thereby highlighting the risks regarding
financial stability. The Committee once again underscored that, to limit such
risks, other policy instruments such as reserve requirement ratios and liquidity
management facilities may be used more effectively as macroprudential tools.
12. In order to encourage the lengthening of the maturities in Turkish lira money
market transactions, the Committee has decided to allow overnight interest
rates to diverge from the policy rate temporarily, when needed. To this end,
the Committee has decided to widen the gap between lending and borrowing
rates by reducing the borrowing rates by 400 basis points. Moreover,
observing the favorable developments in credit conditions, the Committee has
indicated that it would be appropriate to proceed with the remaining measures
outlined in the exit strategy.
13. Commodity prices continue to pose risks regarding the inflation outlook. The
Committee members have highlighted the sharp increases in agricultural
commodity prices such as cotton and wheat. The existing output gap and the
strength of the Turkish lira have been limiting the pass-through from
agricultural commodity prices to the prices of core goods and services.
However, the Committee stated that the impact of the commodity prices on the
general price setting behavior should be closely monitored.

14. The CBT continues to monitor fiscal policy developments closely while
formulating monetary policy. Increasing government savings—and therefore
maintaining fiscal discipline—under the present circumstances is essential to
control the current account deficit driven by the disparity between domestic
and external demand. The Committee members see the Medium Term
Program (MTP) as an important step toward this direction. Accordingly,
inflation forecasts presented in the latest inflation report take the projections of
the fiscal variables in the MTP as given, which envisages that, after a
temporary acceleration in the final quarter of the year, the ratio of government
expenditures to GDP would decline gradually starting from 2011. The
Committee stated that, should the fiscal stance deviate significantly from this
framework and consequently have an adverse effect on the inflation outlook, a
revision in the monetary policy stance may be considered.
15. Monetary policy will continue to focus on price stability in the period ahead.
Strengthening the commitment to fiscal discipline and the structural reform
agenda would support the improvement of Turkey’s sovereign risk, and thus
facilitate macroeconomic and price stability. In this respect, timely
implementation of the structural reforms envisaged by the MTP and the
European Union accession process remains to be of utmost importance.
