TURKISH LIRA DEPOSIT BUYING AUCTIONS PROGRAM  
FOR NOVEMBER 2003 
 
The Central Bank has been conducting Turkish lira d eposit buying auctions 
with a standard four-week maturity since April 2002  as a supplement to its existing 
instruments with the aim of enhancing the effective ness of its efforts to sterilize the 
excess Turkish lira liquidity in the system. As is known, Turkish lira deposit buying 
auctions were held on Wednesdays and Fridays each w eek in October 2003 and the 
maximum amount at each auction was limited to 100 t rillion Turkish liras. 
 
The Central Bank will continue to hold Turkish lira  deposit buying auctions 
with a standard four-week maturity  on Wednesdays and Fridays each week in 
November 2003 as well. Moreover, the Central Bank w ill hold Turkish lira deposit 
buying auctions with a standard two-week maturity  on Mondays  each week. There will 
be no upper limit at each auction. The other guidel ines concerning the principles of 
auction remain the same. 
 
With this adjustment, the amount purchased in Turki sh lira deposit buying 
auctions will be determined more flexibly by consid ering the liquidity level in the 
market, and the Central Bank will be able to enhanc e its effectiveness in sterilizing the 
excess Turkish lira liquidity.
