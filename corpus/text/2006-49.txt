PRESS RELEASE 
ON 
THE CBRT FOREIGN EXCHANGE BUYING AUCTIONS 
  
 The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) announced the general 
framework of the monetary and exchange rate policie s for 2006 through the press releases 
on “General Framework of Inflation Targeting Regime  and Monetary and Foreign Exchange 
Policy for 2006” dated 5 December 2005 and on “the CBRT Foreign Exchange Buying 
Auctions For 2006 and New Turkish Lira Interest Rat es” dated 30 December 2005. In these 
press releases it was stated that:  
 
• Taking into account the likely contribution of a st rong foreign exchange 
reserve position to boost confidence in the current  economic program, foreign 
debt payments of the Treasury and the need to gradu ally reduce the amount 
of high-cost remittances accounts in the long-term,  which constitute a 
significant part in the liabilities side of the CBR T’s balance sheet, the CBRT 
had held foreign exchange buying auctions to build up foreign exchange 
reserves after 2002;  
• The CBRT, which did not have any exchange rate targ et under the floating 
exchange rate regime, would make foreign exchange p urchases via auctions 
whose terms are announced annually in advance in or der to affect the supply 
and demand conditions in the foreign exchange marke t and thus the level of 
exchange rates at a minimum level, and stick to the  basic principles and 
functioning of floating exchange rate regime within  the framework of the 
moderate reserve-raising strategy; 
• The CBRT might, with a prior notice, suspend the au ctions temporarily for 
short or longer periods in cases where the depth of  foreign exchange market 
is lost due to serious exogenous shocks or unforese en extraordinary 
developments, causing excessive volatility in excha nge rates and unhealthy 
price formation.   In this context, the CBRT decided to suspend foreig n exchange buying auctions 
starting from 16 May 2006 in line with the decrease  in foreign exchange supply due to the 
global liquidity conditions. However, following the  measures taken by the CBRT against the 
volatility in financial markets in May and June 200 6 and the recovery of the global liquidity 
conditions, the foreign exchange market has become relatively stable. For this reason, the 
CBRT has decided to resume the suspended foreign ex change buying auctions as of 10 
November 2006. Accordingly, the maximum daily amoun t to be purchased in the auctions will 
be USD 45 million, with USD 15 million for auction amount, and USD 30 million for optional 
selling amount. The other rules for the auctions re main the same and will continue to be 
applied as before.  This auction program will conti nue in 2007 as well, unless extraordinary 
developments are seen in foreign exchange liquidity  conditions.  
 
On the other hand, as was the case before, the CBRT  may, with a prior notice, 
suspend the auctions temporarily  for short or longer periods when the depth of the f oreign 
exchange market is lost due to serious exogenous sh ocks or unforeseen extraordinary 
developments, when the resulting excessive volatili ty and unhealthy price formation is 
observed in exchange rates.
