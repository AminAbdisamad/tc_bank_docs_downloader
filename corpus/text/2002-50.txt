PRESS RELEASE
MAY INFLATION AND FORWARD-LOOKING EXPECTATIONS
I.

GENERAL EVALUATION

1.
The downward inflationary trend in the consumer and wholesale prices
has continued in May. This decline in inflation cannot solely be attributed to
seasonal factors that are observed during this period in every year. Consumer
Price Index (CPI) and Wholesale Price Index (WPI) increased by 0.6 and 0.4
percent, respectively. Annual inflation figures declined to 46.2 percent in CPI
and 49.3 percent in WPI (Table 1).
2.
The food and agriculture prices that have contributed to the
downward inflationary trend starting with February 2002, caused the inflation
figures to remain below expectations in May as well. Clothing and footwear
prices put upward pressure on CPI, while the increase in WPI originated from
the increase in manufacturing industry prices. Due to the considerable increase
in clothing and footwear prices, the CPI inflation excluding food has risen by 2
percent in May, while the WPI inflation excluding agriculture has increased by
1.9 percent.
As has been observed in recent months, the downward trend in the
annual inflation trend, calculated by the annualized 3-month moving averages of
the de-seasonalized CPI and WPI, has continued in May as well. As of May, the
annual inflation trend has declined to 18.3 and 18.9 percent in WPI and CPI,
respectively. The annul inflation trend has been 24.9 percent in WPI excluding
agriculture and 31.5 percent in CPI excluding food.

Developments in Consumer Prices
4.
The main contributing factors to the acceleration of downward trend
in inflation were: the decline in inflationary expectations resulting from
successful implementation of the economic program, the exchange rate stability,
the weak domestic demand, and the less-than expected increases in food and
agriculture prices. The CPI inflation in May mostly originated from the increase
in clothing and footwear prices, which rose by 6.4 percent due to seasonal
factors. The contribution of the clothing and footwear item to the CPI inflation
was 0.6 percentage points in May.
5.
The noticeable decline in food prices, which was beyond expectations and
seasonal factors, contributed substantially to the downward trend in inflation.
Food, beverages and tobacco prices that have displayed a downward trend since
March 2002 declined by 3.3 percent in May. The favorable weather conditions
and restrictions on the exportation of fresh fruit and vegetables resulted in
excess supply, thereby exerting downward pressure on food prices in May.

6.
While the increases in goods prices display a substantial slowdown, the
services sector prices appear to maintain its rigidity. The goods prices increased
by only 0.1 percent in May. Services sector price increase, on the other hand,
stood at 1.6 percent, owing to the 1.8 percent increase in housing rents, 3.3
percent increase in transportation services prices and 1.9 percent increase in
restaurant and hotel prices. As of May, the yearly price increase has been 50.4
percent in goods and 38.6 percent in services sector.

Developments in Wholesale Prices
7.
The depreciation of the Turkish Lira against the US Dollar by 5.3
percent, and against the basket (1 US Dollar+0.77 Euro) by 7.4 percent resulted
in comparatively high price increases in petroleum, chemical and main metal
industry products that are relatively more sensitive to exchange rate changes.
Private manufacturing industry prices were increased by 1.5 percent in line with
the market expectations. The divergences in the rate of increase in prices have
continued, as confirmed by the analysis of the sub-items of the private
manufacturing industry prices. However, the deterioration in the relative price
movements appears to be improving somewhat. As a result of the increases in
the prices of petroleum and chemical products, crude oil-natural gas and main
metal industry products, the public sector prices maintained their upward trend
in May. The increase in the public sector prices was 2.7 percent with a 0.3
percentage point increase compared to April. In January-May period, while the
private sector prices excluding agriculture increased by 7.7 percent, the public
sector prices rose by 10.6.

FORWARD-LOOKING EXPECTATIONS

8.
The inflation in May remained well below the market expectations. There
is no reason why we should not attain the year-end inflation target of 35
percent, as long as the economic program is strictly implemented as planned, and
there will be no unanticipated shocks. The market inflation expectations have
continuously declined since the New Year, as verified by the CBRT Survey of
Expectations. However, due to the political uncertainties, these expectations
increased slightly in the second half of May. With a further decline in such
uncertainties, the less-than expected inflation figures in May are expected to
favorably affect the market inflation expectations in the coming period.

Expectations

9.
In the coming period, the agriculture and food prices are expected to
follow a favorable trend in terms of inflation thanks to the increase in
agricultural production and seasonal effects.
10.
The CBRT expresses, on all occasions, the significance of reaching the
primary surplus target as one of the sine qua non conditions for the success of
the program. Within this framework, priority should be given to the productivity
at public enterprises as a supporting factor for the disinflation process, instead
of using public prices for the financing needs of the state economic enterprises.
The public sector pricing policy has generally been compatible with the inflation
target until now. However, public sector price adjustments appear to have
accelerated over the last months. In this context, the ongoing upward trend in
the public sector prices, and the lagged effects of the increase in exchange
rates are the risk factors that might endanger the disinflation efforts in the
period ahead.
11.
In light of the current inflationary developments, we, as the Central Bank,
are looking positive into the future. The above highlighted risk factors, however,
lead us to remain cautiously optimistic about the inflation outlook.
