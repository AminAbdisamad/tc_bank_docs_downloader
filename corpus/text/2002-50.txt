PRESS RELEASE  
 
MAY INFLATION AND FORWARD -LOOKING EXPECTATIONS  
 
 
I. GENERAL EVALUATION  
 
1. The downward inflationary trend in the consumer and wholesale prices 
has continued in May. This decline in inflation cannot solely be attributed to 
seasonal factors that are observed during this period in every year. Consumer 
Price Index (CPI) and Wholesale Price Index (WPI) increased by 0.6 and 0.4 
percent, respectively. Annua l inflation figures declined to 46.2 percent in CPI 
and 49.3 percent in WPI (Table 1).  
 
2. The food and agriculture prices that have contributed to the 
downward inflationary trend starting with February 2002, caused the inflation 
figures to remain below expec tations in May as well. Clothing and footwear 
prices put upward pressure on CPI, while the increase in WPI originated from 
the increase in manufacturing industry prices. Due to the considerable increase 
in clothing and footwear prices, the CPI inflation ex cluding food has risen by 2 
percent in May, while the WPI inflation excluding agriculture has increased by 
1.9 percent.  
 
3. As has been observed in recent months, the downward trend in  the 
annual inflation trend,  calculated by the annualized 3 -month moving a verages of 
the  de -seasonalized CPI and WPI, has continued in May as well. As of May, the 
annual inflation trend has declined to 18.3 and 18.9 percent in WPI and CPI, 
respectively. The annul inflation trend has been 24.9 percent in WPI excluding 
agricultur e and 31.5 percent in CPI excluding food.

Developments in Consumer Prices  
 
4. The main contributing factors to the acceleration of downward trend 
in inflation were: the decline in inflationary expectations resulting from 
successful implementation of the economic program, the exchange rate stability, 
the weak domestic demand, and the  less-than expected increases in food and 
agriculture prices. The CPI inflation in May mostly originated from the increase 
in clothing and footwear prices, which rose by 6.4 percent due to seasonal 
factors. The contribution of the clothing and footwear ite m to the CPI inflation 
was 0.6 percentage points in May.  
 
5. The noticeable decline in food prices, which was beyond expectations and 
seasonal factors, contributed substantially to the downward trend in inflation. 
Food, beverages and tobacco prices that h ave displayed a downward trend since 
March 2002 declined by 3.3 percent in May. The favorable weather conditions 
and restrictions on the exportation of fresh fruit and vegetables resulted in 
excess supply, thereby exerting downward pressure on food prices in May.

6. While the increases in goods prices display a substantial slowdown, the 
services sector prices appear to maintain its rigidity. The goods prices increased 
by only 0.1 percent in May. Services sector price increase, on the other hand, 
stood at 1.6 percent, owing to the 1.8 percent increase in housing rents, 3.3 
percent increase in trans portation services prices and 1.9 percent increase in 
restaurant and hotel prices. As of May, the yearly price increase has been 50.4 
percent in goods and 38.6 percent in services sector.

Developments in Wholesale Prices  
 
7. The depreciation of the Turkish Lira against the US Dollar by 5.3 
percent, and against the basket (1 US Dollar+0.77 Euro) by 7.4 percent resulted 
in comparatively high price increases in petroleum, chemical and main metal 
industry products that are relatively more sensitive to exchange rate changes. 
Private manufacturing industry prices were increased by 1.5 percent in line with 
the market expectations . The divergences in the rate of increase in prices have 
continued, as confirmed by the analysis of the sub -items of the private 
manufacturing industry prices. However, the deterioration in the relative price 
movements appears to be improving somewhat. As a result of the increases in 
the prices of petroleum and chemical products, crude oil -natural gas and main 
metal industry products, the public sector prices maintained their upward trend 
in May. The increase in the public sector prices was 2.7 percent with  a 0.3 
percentage point increase compared to April.  In January -May period, while the 
private sector prices excluding agriculture increased by 7.7 percent, the public 
sector prices rose by 10.6.

II. FORWARD -LOOKING EXPECTATIONS  
 
8. The inflation in May remained well below the market expectations. There 
is no reason why we should not attain the year -end inflation target of 35 
percent, as long as the economic program is strictly implemented as planned, and 
there will be no unanticipated shocks. The market inflation expectations have 
continuously declined since the New Year, as verified by the CBRT Survey of 
Expectations. However, due to the  political uncertainties, these expectations 
increased slightly in the second half of May. With a further decline in such 
uncertainties, the less -than expected inflation figures in May are expected to 
favorably affect the market inflation expectations in t he coming period.

Expectations

9. In the coming period, the agriculture and food prices are expected to 
follow a favorable trend in terms of inflation thanks to the increase in 
agricultural production and seasonal effects.  
  
10. The CBRT expresses, on all occasions, the significance of reaching the 
primary surplus target as one of the sine qua non conditions for the success of 
the program. Within this framework, priority should be given to the productivity 
at public enterprises as a supporting factor for the disinflation process, instead 
of using public prices for the financing needs of the state economic enterprises.  
The public sector pricing policy has generally been compatible with the inflation 
target until now. However, public sector price adjustments appear to have 
accelerated over the last months. In this context, the ongoing upward trend in 
the public sector pr ices, and the lagged effects of the increase in exchange 
rates are the risk factors that might endanger the disinflation efforts in the 
period ahead.  
 
11. In light of the current inflationary developments, we, as the Central Bank, 
are looking positive into  the future. The above highlighted risk factors, however, 
lead us to remain cautiously optimistic about the inflation outlook.
