SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 22 May 2014

Inflation Developments
1. In April, consumer prices rose by 1.34 percent month-on-month, and annual
inflation increased by 1 percentage points to 9.38 percent. This uptick in
annual inflation was particularly driven by food prices. Meanwhile, the lagged
effects of the depreciation in the Turkish lira continued to affect core inflation
indicators adversely through the core goods channel.
2. Annual food group inflation climbed to 13.15 percent amid soaring prices of
fruits in April, contrary to their moderate course in the first quarter. The rise in
the annual processed food inflation remained comparatively limited.
3. Prices of services edged up by 0.55 percent month-on-month, and the group’s
annual inflation remained flat at 8.61 percent. The persisting rise in the prices
of catering services (restaurants-hotels) due to the developments in the food
group excluding fruits and vegetables lost pace compared to the first quarter.
Annual inflation in rents, transport and communication services exhibited a
relatively mild course in this period, while other services (particularly health
and education) posted rising figures. The seasonally adjusted data point to
persisting high levels in the underlying trend of services inflation in this period
without any further acceleration.
4. Annual core goods inflation rose by 1.06 percentage points to 11.10 percent in
April. With the effect of accumulated depreciation in the Turkish lira, the
annual inflation in durable consumer goods reached 15.87 percent. In this
group, price increases in automobiles and white goods decelerated in contrast
to the upsurge in furniture prices. Meanwhile, clothing prices rose above
seasonal averages in April and the group’s annual inflation reached 7.61
percent. April developments indicate that the effects of the exchange rate
waned in some groups, yet spread across the core goods group. Accordingly,
core goods became the main driver of the rise in the underlying trend of the
core inflation.

Factors Affecting Inflation
5. Data for the first quarter of 2014 point to a moderate increase in economic
activity. On the production side, following the rise in January, the industrial
production index posted a slight fall in February and March. Thus, production
maintained a steady trend of quarterly increase by exceeding the average of
the previous quarter by 1.4 percent in the first quarter. The upcoming period is
expected to witness an ongoing rise in production with the support of exports
and modest course in the domestic demand.
6. Data on expenditure side show that private demand weakened in the first
quarter due to developments in the consumption of durable goods and the
investment of private machinery-equipment. On the other hand, data on the
consumption of nondurable goods and construction investments remain
favorable. Among subcategories of imports of consumption goods, imports of
automobiles plunged, while imports of durable and semi-durable goods fell
moderately and imports of non-durable goods continued to rise in the first
quarter. In this period, the production of durable goods was down from the
previous quarter, whereas the production of nondurable goods remained on
the rise. Among the indicators of machinery-equipment investments, the
production and imports of investment goods excluding transport declined.
Moreover, the data regarding construction investments show that the increase
in construction investments continued.
7. With the support of recovery in consumption demand thanks to reduced
perceptions of uncertainty, improved confidence indices, and appreciation in
Turkish lira, the domestic demand is expected to settle on a track of gradual
increase starting from second quarter. Nevertheless, second-quarter CBRT
Business Tendency Survey (BTS), PMI, loans and imports data suggest that
this recovery will be moderate.
8. Recent data show that exports continued to grow in the first quarter of 2014.
The export volume index excluding gold rose again in March and hovered
above its average in the previous quarter. With the support of the global
recovery signaled by recent survey indicators, and the pickup in international
trade, exports are envisaged to follow a favorable path in the upcoming period.
PMI and BTS export indicators also support this outlook.
9. In seasonally adjusted terms, total and non-farm unemployment rates declined
in February 2014. This drop in unemployment rates was driven by the upsurge
in non-farm employment. Furthermore, seasonally adjusted data regarding
total employment expectations, a BTS indicator, maintain its trend of favorable
outlook.

10. In sum, recent data releases indicate that the private final domestic demand
will follow a modest course, and with the help of the recovery in foreign
demand, net exports will contribute positively to growth. It is expected that the
current outlook in demand components will curb inflationist pressures and
support the improvement in the current account deficit.
Monetary Policy and Risks
11. Owing to the significant decline in uncertainties about the Fed’s asset
purchases recently coupled with the recovery in global growth, the risk
sentiment improved across global financial markets. Along with these
developments, emerging economies saw limited amounts of portfolio inflows
after a long while. Risk indicators, which deteriorated in times of elevated
country-specific risks in Turkey, recovered due to the waning domestic and
external uncertainties. With the recent decline in uncertainties and
improvement in the risk premium indicators, market interest rates declined
across all maturities. In this regard, the Committee decided on a measured
decrease in the one-week funding rate. It is stated that, with a flat yield curve
even after this decision, the monetary policy stance will continue to be tight.
12. The Committee closely monitors inflation expectations and the pricing
behavior. The slowdown in consumer loans and the weak private demand are
expected to restrict the effect of the cost-push shocks on inflation in the
coming period. Moreover, thanks to the strong and front-loaded monetary
tightening delivered in January and the recently-waned uncertainties, a
considerable portion of the depreciation in the Turkish lira during the first
quarter is reversed. This development in the exchange rates is assessed to
contribute favorably to the inflation outlook. However, lagged effects of the
exchange rate movements and the unfavorable course of food prices are likely
to cause inflation to remain above the target for some time. In the meantime,
the Committee will closely monitor inflation expectations, the pricing behavior
and other factors that affect inflation and maintain the tight monetary policy
stance by keeping the yield curve flat until there is a significant improvement in
the inflation outlook.
13. The Committee stated that loan growth continues at reasonable levels in
response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures.
Across subcategories, growth rates of consumer loans and credit cards exhibit
a notable slowdown, while growth of commercial loans expand at a rate close
to past years. The Committee assessed that this positive development in loan
growth composition will contribute to financial stability, the rebalancing process
and the decrease in inflation. In line with these developments, recent data

indicate a modest course in the private final domestic demand. Meanwhile, net
exports are expected to contribute positively to economic growth thanks to the
recovery in external demand, particularly from European countries, and real
exchange rate developments. The Committee expects that such a demand
composition will support disinflation and will lead to a significant improvement
in the current account deficit in 2014.
14. Although having faded to a great extent, the uncertainty about global monetary
policies is yet to disappear. Expectations about the timing and pace of the
Fed’s rate hike are important to the pricing in financial markets. However, the
transmission mechanism of the interest rate channel is better known than the
quantitative easing and the monetary policy dependence on high-frequency
data has decreased. As a result, it is assessed that the uncertainty effect of an
interest rate hike on financial markets might be more limited than that of the
exit from the quantitative easing program. Moreover, the ECB’s possible
quantitative easing might be another supporting factor for capital flows. Hence,
capital may start flowing back to emerging economies. If this scenario
materializes, the Central Bank might take steps to accumulate foreign
exchange reserves.
15. The Committee closely monitors developments on fiscal policy and tax
adjustments with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline
monetary stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will
be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes on administered prices
in the forthcoming period. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be
considered, should the fiscal stance deviate significantly from this framework,
and consequently, have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation
outlook.
16. Strengthening structural reforms that will ensure the sustainability of the fiscal
discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability
in the medium term. Steps taken in this regard will also provide more room for
maneuvering the monetary policy and improving social welfare by keeping
interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels. In this respect,
implementing the structural reforms required by the MTP remains to be of
utmost importance.
