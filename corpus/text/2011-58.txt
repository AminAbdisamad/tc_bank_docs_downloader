The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short
term interest rates constant at the following levels:
a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) at 5.75 percent,
b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 5 percent, lending rate at 12.5
percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via
repo transactions at 12 percent,
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.):
Borrowing rate at 0 percent, lending rate at 15.5 percent.
Data on the third quarter of the year confirms that the rebalancing between the
domestic and external demand is ongoing as envisaged. Consumption demand is
decelerating and the contribution of net external demand to growth is increasing.
Accordingly, the improvement in the current account balance is becoming more
pronounced.
The Committee has noted that inflation will increase in December due to the
base effects from unprocessed food prices. The Central Bank delivered a strong
tightening in October in order to prevent the potential second round effects of a 2011
year-end inflation that will exceed the target significantly. Although recent data releases
suggest that the economic activity is stronger than expected, domestic demand is
expected to follow a moderate path due to monetary tightening. In fact, the slowdown in
the consumer loan growth is becoming more pronounced. Therefore, the Committee
expects second round effects of the temporary price movements to remain contained
and inflation to fall gradually throughout 2012, converging to 5 percent target during the
final months of the year.
The Committee has indicated that tight monetary policy should be maintained for
a while in order to keep inflation outlook consistent with the medium term targets.
However, given the prevailing uncertainties regarding global economy, it would be
appropriate to preserve the flexibility of monetary policy. Therefore, the impact of the
measures undertaken on credit, domestic demand, and inflation expectations will be
monitored closely and the amount of Turkish lira funding via one-week repo auctions will
be timely adjusted on either direction, if needed.
Moreover, the Committee has determined the main components of the “Monetary
and Exchange Rate Policy in 2012” document, to be published on Tuesday 27th of
December.

In line with the strategy formulated at the interim meeting of August 4, 2011, the
Committee will continue to monitor global developments closely and take the needed
measures promptly to maintain the stability in the domestic financial markets.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the
Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within
five working days.
