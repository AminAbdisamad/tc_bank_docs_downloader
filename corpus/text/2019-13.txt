The	leading	indicators	suggest	that	there	has	been	a	moderate	recovery	in	domestic	demand	in	the	first	quarter.	Underpinned	by	the	strong	trend	in	the	exports	of	goods	and	tourism	demand,	net	exports	continue	to	contribute	to	growth.	In	this	regard,	improvement	in	current	account	balance	is	expected	to	continue	with	further	acceleration.		In	the	economic	rebalancing	process,	the	monetary	policy	focuses	on	the	price	stability	objective	while	the	strong	coordination	with	fiscal	policy	supports	disinflation.	Meanwhile,	the	Central	Bank	is	decisive	about	its	policy	towards	reinforcing	its	reserves.	Accordingly,	an	uptrend	was	observed	in	the	reserves	following	the	financial	market	volatility	observed	last	year.	The	recent	fluctuations	in	gross	reserves	are	driven	by	ordinary	transactions	and	periodic	factors,	and	there	are	no	unforeseen	incidences.		The	Central	Bank	will	closely	monitor	fluctuations	and	unhealthy	price	formations	in	financial	markets	and	will	use	all	monetary	policy	and	liquidity	management	instruments	to	maintain	price	stability	and	support	financial	stability,	if	deemed	necessary.
