The Central Bank of Turkey (the CBT) has been implemen ting an inflation 
targeting regime since the beginning of 2006. The Cen tral Bank Law, as stipulated in 
the Article 42, requires the CBT to be accountable for the non-fulfillment of inflation 
targets. Inflation target for end-year 2008 was joint ly set with the Government as 4 
percent. To facilitate the accountability principle, our  policy statement titled 
“Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy in 2008” disclosed a q uarterly path consistent 
with the end-year 2008 targets along with an uncertai nty band. In this context, any 
breach of upper or lower limits of the band requires t he CBT to write an open letter 
to the Government, explaining the reasons for the breach  and the measures to be 
taken to ensure that inflation rate will return to le vels within pre-established limits. 
Inflation outturn as of December 2008 was 10.06 percent , breaching the upper 
limit of the uncertainty band, which was set at 6 percen t for the end-year (Figure 1). 
Accordingly, this open letter explains the reasons for thi s breach and presents the 
strategy adopted by the CBT to bring inflation back to  the medium term targets.

Reasons For Breaching the Target 
Inflation in 2008 was largely determined by developme nts in the global 
economy. After sharp increases in energy and other commod ity prices in the first 
three quarters, there has been a dramatic shift in infl ation dynamics in the last 
quarter. With the intensification of the global finan cial crisis, commodity prices have 
displayed a sharp reversal as the global loss of confidence led to a significant 
slowdown in the world economic activity. Accordingly, ther e has been a marked fall 
in domestic energy and processed food inflation in the l ast quarter. Yet, cumulative 
past increases in the commodity prices have kept annual infl ation at relatively high 
levels. Around 6.2 percentage points of the 10.1 percent  annual CPI inflation in 2008 
can be explained by the direct impact of the increases in food and energy prices 
(Figure 2).

With the collapse in commodity prices, processed food infla tion, which is 
relatively sensitive to import price developments, followe d a more favorable course 
than our expectations in the last quarter of 2008. On t he other hand, unprocessed 
food inflation displayed high volatility throughout t he year, showing a marked rise in 
the last quarter. Overall, although food inflation ea sed in 2008 compared to the 
previous year, it was still higher than the headline in flation. 
Energy price inflation displayed a significant fall in the last quarter of the year, 
yet it materialized at around 20 percent by the end of the year. Therefore, given the 
recent decline in oil prices, we think there is still ampl e room for fall in energy 
inflation. Accordingly, we expect the contribution of en ergy prices to headline 
inflation to come down considerably throughout 2009.                                                                                         Central Bank of Turkey  
 3During the first three quarters of the year, inflatio n in services stayed at high 
levels due to lagged impacts of food and energy prices, e specially in catering and 
transport services. The upward trend in services inflation r eversed in the last quarter 
with the sharp weakening in economic activity and falling  commodity prices (Figure 
3). Rent inflation, on the other hand displayed a ste ady decline throughout the year. 
We expect services inflation to continue to decelerate in 2 009, as the accumulated 
impacts of the supply shocks fade away and the domestic dema nd remains weak.

Annual rate of increase in CPI excluding food, energy, tobacco and gold (I) 
declined from 7.3 percent to 7 percent in the last quar ter. Seasonally adjusted 
monthly core inflation figures suggest that underlying inflation has displayed a 
downward trend in the last quarter, notwithstanding t he significant depreciation in 
the Turkish lira (Figure 4).

 4Cross-country figures confirm that inflation has been dri ven mostly by global 
factors in the past year. Elevated commodity prices in the  first three quarters of 2008 
exerted inflationary pressures all over the world, pushin g inflation rates above the 
targets. Along with the easing in global inflationary  pressures, inflation displayed a 
downward trend in emerging market economies. Notwithsta nding the downturn in 
the last quarter, most of the emerging economies  under  inflation targeting have 
faced significant breaches in their inflation targets at the end of 2008 (Figure 5).

Monetary Policy  
Inflation dynamics in the first half of 2008 was domina ted by the surge in 
commodity prices, leading to a rise in inflation expectat ions. In order to contain the 
deterioration in inflation expectations and to prevent the materialization of the 
second round effects of these shocks, the Monetary Policy Com mittee (MPC) 
implemented a monetary tightening during May-July pe riod, increasing the policy 
rates by a cumulative of 150 basis points. The tightening  in monetary policy, which 
was implemented jointly with the change in inflation targets, was effective in 
controlling expectations (Figure 6).

Following the intensification of the problems in the g lobal economy, both 
domestic and external demand slowed down considerably in the last quarter of 
2008. Despite the weakening in aggregate demand, uncer tainties regarding the 
global financial and commodity markets and concerns about their reflections on the 
inflation outlook required monetary policy to remain cautious during the peak of the 
turmoil. Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep policy rat es constant in September 
and October meetings. Incoming information since then ha s suggested that the 
significant slowdown in the aggregate demand and falli ng commodity prices would 
lead to a sharp fall in inflation, and that inflatio nary impact of the exchange rate 
movements would be lower than the levels implied by the  historical estimates. 
Therefore, the MPC cut interest rates by a 50 basis poin ts in November and a 
further 125 basis points in December (Table 1).

 6As the incoming information on inflation and economic a ctivity vindicated the 
policy rate cuts, inflation expectations reacted favorably,  displaying a sharp fall in 
January (Figure 6). These developments have enhanced the credibility of monetary 
policy. As a consequence, monetary policy decisions and the associated 
communication were effective in shaping the yield curve an d bringing down longer-
term interest rates. Benchmark bond rates came down signif icantly, partly driven by 
the easing tensions in global financial markets (Figure 7 ). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Recent forecasts suggest that ongoing problems in internat ional credit markets 
and the global economy may last longer than what had been previously envisaged. 
Downward revisions in growth forecasts and the sharp fall in oil and other 
commodity prices have increased the probability of undersh ooting our medium term 
targets. Accordingly, the MPC decided to cut policy rates by a further 200 basis 
points in January, moving forward a sizeable part of th e monetary accommodation 
envisaged for the incoming months (Table 1). 
Inflation Outlook 
Factors affecting inflation outlook displayed a sharp dow nturn in the last 
quarter with easing commodity prices and the slowdown in  economic activity. Both 
import prices and aggregate demand turned out to be w eaker than envisaged in our 
baseline assumptions. Moreover, pass-through from exchange r ates to domestic 
inflation was significantly lower than implied by the historical estimates. As a 
consequence, end-year inflation materialized at 10.1 p ercent—significantly below 
our forecast of 11.1 percent. Therefore our starting po int for the medium term 
inflation forecasts has shifted down by 1-percentage poin ts. 
Credit conditions tightened considerably and bank loan r ates displayed a sharp 
rise after the intensification of the global financial crisis. The pace of consumer credit 
growth suggests that financial conditions were restrictive i n the last quarter of 2008, Figure 7: Benchmark Interest Rate and Policy Rate

 7as consumer loans fell in nominal terms for the first tim e in the near history (Figure

Recent easing in monetary policy has helped to relieve t he tension in domestic 
credit markets, as there has been a significant fall in con sumer loan rates following 
the policy rate cuts. Yet, business loans rates remain eleva ted (Figure 9). 
Heightened risk aversion and the tightening in global cr edit conditions are expected 
to continue to restrain domestic credit growth in the fo rthcoming period.

In September and October, high level of uncertainty ste mming from the 
intensification of global financial market turmoil has l ed to a wave of financial 
deleveraging, leading to a sharp rise in sovereign credit  risk premia and a significant

At the time of the publication of our previous open le tter (end-October), the 
extent of the pass-through from exchange rates to domestic inflation was a major 
source of uncertainty for the inflation outlook. In the  letter, we indicated that the 
significant slowdown in domestic demand growth should lim it the second round 
effects of the exchange rate pass-through, and that the p ass-through from exchange 
rates to the domestic inflation should be relatively lim ited compared to previous 
episodes. Still, given the sizeable depreciation, we for ecasted that the first round 
effects of the depreciation would add around 1.2 percen tage points to 2008 end-
year inflation and a further 1.5 percentage points to  2009 inflation.  
The materialization of the exchange rate pass-through i n the last quarter of 
2008 turned out to be even below our October estimates.  Figure 11 compares two 
different periods of significant currency depreciation, n amely October-December 
2008 and May-July 2006, in terms of pass-through in dur able goods—historically the 
most sensitive item in the CPI to the exchange rate develo pments. Prices of most of 
the durables goods in the CPI basket displayed no signifi cant change (with the 
exception of electrical appliances, prices of which are larg ely indexed to the 
exchange rates) in the post September-October 2008 perio d, whereas all durable 
goods had showed sharp increases in the post May-June 2006 period.

In the October open letter, we predicted that the shar p slowdown in aggregate 
demand and the depreciation in the Turkish Lira would lead to a higher contribution 
from net exports to aggregate demand. We also predicted , though, that this effect 
would be largely offset by the slowdown in external de mand due to the sharp 
economic downturn in our major trading partners. Our e xport performance has 
become more sensitive to global business cycles in the past ye ars as the share of 
durables and capital goods has increased in time. Althoug h export developments in 
the fourth quarter were qualitatively in line with o ur expectations, the extent of the 
slowdown in our major trading partners and thus the con traction in exports were 
deeper than envisaged in our baseline scenario.  
World economies have become increasingly interdependent si nce the onset of 
the global crisis in September 2007. Domestic inflation and monetary policy outlook 
is likely to remain sensitive to the developments in the global economy, at least in 
the short-to-medium term. The latest Consensus Forecasts sur vey suggest that 
major developed economies will continue to contract throu ghout 2009, before 
recovering gradually in 2010. Therefore, as a starting point, our baseline forecast is 
based on the assumption that there will be a gradual r ecovery in the global economy 
starting from the first quarter of 2010.   
Third quarter GDP figures showed that domestic demand co ntinued to contract 
for the three consecutive quarters (Figure 12). Our fore casts in October Inflation 
Report envisaged a moderation in domestic economic activity  in the last quarter of 
2008. Recent readings on domestic sales, production and con fidence indicators 
suggest that the weakening in domestic economic activity has been deeper than we 
had envisaged. 1

Looking ahead, intensified problems in global economy a nd the tight credit 
conditions are likely to restrain domestic demand for an extended period. We 
envisage some recovery in consumption spending in the second half of 2009, as the 
monetary accommodation will start feeding through the economy in about two 
quarters. However, we expect the recovery to be gradual, as it will take time to fully 
restore consumer confidence in the aftermath of the most serious global crisis in 
decades. 
Overall, we are likely to face a protracted period of w eak economic activity in 
the forthcoming period. Hence, our revised forecasts incorp orate a significantly 
larger contribution from aggregate demand conditions t o disinflation, compared to 
the previous letter. Figure 13 displays the revision in o ur output gap estimates for 
the third and fourth quarters of 2008 with respect to the estimates appeared in the 
October Inflation Report. As depicted in the figure, t here has been a marked 
downward revision for the fourth quarter, which is the major factor for the recent 
change in inflation and monetary policy outlook.

 11         The sharp fall in oil prices is another major f actor leading to a downward 
revision in our end-2009 inflation forecasts. 2 Our baseline scenario in the October 
Inflation Report envisaged a constant path for oil price s around USD 80 per barrel 
over the forecast horizon. However, oil prices continued t o fall in the meantime, 
averaging around 56 USD in the last quarter of 2008. Taking the average of oil price 
futures for one to two years maturity in the first thr ee weeks of January as a 
benchmark, we have revised our baseline scenario for oil pr ices down to USD 55 
per barrel for the next two years.  
The course of food inflation was close to the path outli ned in the baseline 
scenario of the October Inflation Report. Although pro cessed food prices followed a 
sharper downward trend than expected, unprocessed food in flation continued to 
display a high volatility, materializing at a level hi gher than predicted for end-2008. 
Accordingly, we retained our assumptions for food inflat ion at 7.5 percent for 2009 
and 6 percent for the following years. 
Against this background, our medium term forecasts suggest t hat, assuming a 
decelerating pace of reductions in policy rates during th e earlier part of 2009; with 70 
percent probability, inflation will be between 5.4 a nd 8.2 percent (mid-point 6.8) at 
the end of 2009, and between 4 percent and 7.6 per ce nt (mid-point 5.8) at the end 
of 2010. We expect inflation to come down to 5.2 percen t by the end of 2011 (Figure 
14).

 12 To sum up, there has been a downward revision in our me dium term inflation 
forecasts, especially for the end-2009, owing mainly to the impacts of the favorable 
energy prices and the weakening aggregate demand. The main message of the 
forecast is that the probability of undershooting the e nd-2009 inflation target has 
increased, notwithstanding the significant policy easing i n the past couple of months. 
It should be emphasized that any new data or informat ion regarding the 
inflation outlook may lead to a change in our policy st ance. Therefore, assumptions 
on the future policy rates underlying the inflation f orecast should not be perceived as 
a commitment on behalf of the CBT.  
Risks 
Strains on global money and capital markets have shown sig ns of easing since 
the publication of our October Inflation Report. Howe ver, the overall confidence loss, 
wealth destruction and the tightening of credit conditi ons especially for the business 
sector, have led to a marked downturn in the global econ omic activity. In line with 
latest Consensus Forecasts, our baseline scenario envisages a re covery in global 
economic activity starting from the first quarter of 2010 . Yet, there is still a 
considerable amount of uncertainty surrounding the glob al economy. We think 
developments in the global economy will be the main de terminant of the outlook for 
domestic inflation and monetary policy in the medium t erm. Hence, in order to 
enhance the predictability and transparency of monetary  policy, we decided to 
present two alternative scenarios in the Inflation Repor t, each one based on different 
timing and speed of the recovery in the global economic activity. The two alternative 
scenarios are embedded in our forecasts through four main  channels: External 
trade, portfolio flows, commodity prices, and credit chan nels.  
In particular, our first alternative scenario is based on a relatively fast recovery 
in the world economy. In this scenario we assume that the  monetary and fiscal 
measures taken by the major developed economies will be a dequate to start pulling  
the global economy out of the recession in the second hal f of 2009. Accordingly, a 
rapid and stronger-than-envisaged recovery in the global  economic activity would 
lead to a rebound in commodity prices, resurge in capita l inflows to emerging 
economies, pick up in external demand, and relaxation in credit conditions. Under 
this scenario, meeting medium term inflation targets of  7.5, 6.5 and 5.5 percent in 
the 2009-2011 period, respectively, could require measur ed policy rate hikes 
towards the end of 2009. 
Our second alternative scenario is based on the assumption o f a further 
deepening in global crisis in the first half of 2009 an d an extended period of 
weakness in global economic activity until the second half o f 2010. In this scenario a 
more protracted and slow recovery would lead to another  wave of portfolio shock for 
emerging markets, weak external demand, tighter credit co nditions, and further 
drops in commodity prices. Our forecasts suggest that, in such  a case, medium term 
inflation targets could be undershot even with a measure d sequel of policy rate cuts 
throughout 2009.                                                                                       Central Bank of Turkey  
 13 It is worth to mention that a critical assumption underl ying the inflation and 
monetary policy outlook outlined above is that governmen t fiscal stance will remain 
neutral in cyclically adjusted terms, and that there wil l be no changes in indirect 
taxes or administered price adjustments, except those requir ed by the existing 
automatic pricing mechanisms. Any significant deviation fro m this framework may 
lead to a revision of the outlook for inflation and mo netary policy.  
Conclusion 
Factors affecting the inflation outlook have undergone si gnificant changes in 
the last quarter of 2008. With the financial crisis turn ing into a worldwide recession, 
there has been a sharp downturn in both domestic and ext ernal demand. Moreover, 
commodity prices collapsed in response to the worsening glo bal economic outlook. 
Growth forecasts for the global economy have been constant ly revised downwards 
in the last couple of months, and the risks are still seen on the downside. These 
developments have increased the probability of undershoot ing our inflation target at 
the end of year 2009, setting the ground for monetar y accommodation. Accordingly, 
we have cut the policy rates by a total of 375 basis poin ts in the past three months. 
Moreover, we have taken several measures in order to facili tate the smooth 
functioning of our financial markets since October. We wil l continue to take the 
necessary measures to contain the adverse effects of the glob al financial turmoil on 
the domestic economy, provided that they do not conflict with the price stability 
objective.  
Uncertainties regarding the lagged impact of the probl ems in financial markets 
on the global economy remain at high levels. Prudent m onetary policy is necessary 
but not sufficient to maintain the resilience of the eco nomy against the global crisis, 
especially under current conditions. Preserving the fiscal d iscipline and 
strengthening the structural reform agenda would help to mitigate the adverse 
effects of the ongoing shocks on the domestic economy. In th is respect, the 
European Union accession process and the implementation of  structural reforms 
envisaged in the economic program remain to be of utmost  importance. In particular, 
advances in structural reforms, which would improve the qua lity of fiscal discipline 
and enhance productivity gains, are monitored closely by the CBT with regard to 
their implications for macroeconomic and price stability.
