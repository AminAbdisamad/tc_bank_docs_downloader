DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Meeting Date: December 17, 2009
Committee Members

M. İbrahim Turhan, Abdullah Yavaş, Mehmet Yörükoğlu.
The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to keep policy rates
unchanged as follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 6.50 percent, lending rate at 9
percent,
b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing
rate at 2.50 percent, lending rate at 12 percent,
c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities
provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 8 percent.
Recent data releases indicate a moderate pace of recovery in the economic activity.
However, there are still uncertainties regarding the aggregate demand, and the
employment conditions are expected to take a long time to fully recover. Therefore,
resource utilization, hence inflation, is expected to stay around low levels in the medium
term. The Committee has stated that strong base effects would be observed in forthcoming
periods. This would lead to a significant increase in annual inflation, especially in
December, yet core inflation would remain at low levels.
The Committee notes that the cumulative policy rate cuts implemented since
November 2008 and the improvements in global risk perceptions have started to exert
favorable effects on credit markets. However, lingering problems across the global
economy are not resolved completely and there are still uncertainties regarding the
strength of the recovery. Accordingly, in line with the policy stance presented in the Inflation
Report, the Committee has emphasized that it would be necessary to keep policy rates at
low levels for a long period of time.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation
outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within
eight working days.
