DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Meeting Date: October 22, 2008
Committee Members
Durmuş Yılmaz (Governor), Erdem Başçı, Burhan Göklemez, M. İbrahim Turhan,
Abdullah Yavaş, Mehmet Yörükoğlu.
The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to adjust the
policy rates as follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate is left unchanged at 16.75 percent,
while lending rate is decreased from 20.25 percent to 19.75 percent,
b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate between 4:00 p.m. –
5:00 p.m. is left unchanged at 12,75 percent, while lending rate is decreased
from 23,25 percent to 22,75 percent,
c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities
provided for primary dealers via repo transactions is decreased from 19.25
percent to 18.75 percent.
Recent readings indicate a significant slowdown in domestic economic activity.
Ongoing problems in international credit markets and the global economy continue to
restrain both the domestic and external demand. Inflationary impact of the recent
exchange rate movements will be offset by the favorable outlook in food prices and the
sharp decline in oil prices. Inflation is expected to display a limited and temporary rise in
October due to volatile food prices, yet continue to decline gradually in the medium
term. Accordingly, the Committee at this point does not envision a significant revision in
medium term inflation forecasts.
However, it should be noted that the intensification of the financial market turmoil
requires caution in terms of both the monetary policy and the inflation outlook.
In this respect, the Committee decided to keep borrowing rates –the key policy
rates– unchanged, while lowering the lending rates by 50 basis points in order to
contain the potential volatility in short term interest rates.
The meeting agenda also included an assessment of the developments in foreign
exchange markets. The Committee emphasized the importance of a liquid foreign
exchange market under current conditions and stated that supporting the liquidity
positions of the banks should be the priority, and suggested that raising the transaction
limits at the Foreign Exchange Deposit Markets would be helpful in this regard.
Moreover, the Committee agreed that other measures would be implemented as
needed.
The Central Bank will continue to take the necessary measures to contain the
adverse effects of the global financial turmoil on the domestic economy. Future policy
decisions will largely depend on the developments in global markets and their
reflections on the local financial markets.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation
outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within
eight working days.
