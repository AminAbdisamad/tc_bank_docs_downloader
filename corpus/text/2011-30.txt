PRESS RELEASE ON REQUIRED RESERVES
In line with the strategic framework set out at the Monetary Policy Committee
Meeting held on 4 August 2011, with the aim of mitigating the fluctuations in repo
interest rates, an amendment has been made to the Communiqué on Reserve
Requirements. Accordingly, the funding from the repo transactions will be included in
the liabilities that are currently subject to required reserves by taking the average of
daily balances between two calculation periods, instead of being computed bi-weekly
on Fridays.
The abovementioned regulation will be effective as of the calculation period of
5 August 2011.
