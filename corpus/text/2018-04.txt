As stipulated in the Article 42 of the Central Bank Law No. 1211, if the inflation target is not
attained, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) is accountable for reporting to the
Government and announcing to the public the reasons behind the exceeding of the inflation target
and the necessary measures to be taken. As stated in the main policy document titled “Monetary and
Exchange Rate Policy in 2017”, which was published on 6 December 2016, the inflation target for
2017 was set jointly with the Government as 5 percent. In the same document, it was also indicated
that the CBRT would write an open letter to the Government should the year-end inflation deviate
from the target range (by more than 2 percentage points in either direction from the target). At end2017, inflation stood above the target range. This document elaborates on the reasons for the
deviation of the inflation from the target and explains the measures already taken—and to be
taken—to bring inflation back to the target.
Factors Affecting Inflation in 2017
The main factor causing inflation to overshoot the target in 2017 was the notable depreciation of the
Turkish lira. In addition, USD-denominated import prices remained above projections in this
period. Despite posing a downward pressure on inflation in the 2012-2016 period, import prices
recorded an increase in 2017 and posed a cost-side pressure on inflation in tandem with the
tumbling Turkish lira. In fact, producer prices soared by 15.47 percent in 2017 and producer pricesbased pressures on consumer prices remained strong throughout the year. Moreover, annual
inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages was realized as 13.79 percent, and played a
significant role in the deviation of inflation from the target. In 2017, the brisk course of economic
activity stood as another factor to fuel the increase in inflation. The deterioration in inflation
expectations, together with the worsening in overall pricing behavior also proved influential in the
surge in inflation. On the other hand, owing to the stronger coordination between monetary and
fiscal policies, the contributions of public prices and taxes to inflation was limited in 2017
compared to previous years.
The Turkish lira depreciated by 22 percent on average against the currency basket in 2017. Adverse
impacts of this depreciation were manifested across the subcategories of consumer inflation, and
particularly the core goods group, which is characterized by high exchange rate pass-through.
Cumulative effects of the depreciation were evident across the group, and especially products with
high import content such as automobiles registered sharp price increases. Moreover, the brisk
external demand for certain sectors coupled with the increased domestic demand in sectors subject

to temporary tax reduction incentives allowed cumulative cost pressures to be reflected in prices
more easily.
International commodity prices trended upwards across 2017. Increasing by around 25 percent
compared to 2016, international metal and oil prices became one of the major determinants of the
rise in inflation through the cost channel. The uptick in oil and other input prices as well as the
depreciation of the Turkish lira caused a year-on-year increase in the annual energy inflation.
Another factor that drove consumer inflation upwards in 2017 was food prices. Contrary to the
favorable outlook in the previous year, annual inflation both in processed and unprocessed food
group remained elevated across the year. Producer inflation in agricultural products stood at 17.30
percent at the year-end. Although the measures taken by the Food and Agricultural Product Markets
Monitoring and Evaluation Committee contained inflationary pressures in certain subcategories,
cost developments, sectoral price shocks and the rebound in tourism caused food prices to have a
higher contribution to annual inflation than historical averages.
Services inflation recorded gradual increments across the year. The high level of inflation had an
adverse impact on the rate of price increases in items with vigorous indexation behavior,
particularly education services and rent. The outlook for food inflation pushed inflation up in the
restaurants-hotels group through the catering services channel. Meanwhile, fuel prices, which
soared amid the depreciation of the Turkish lira accompanied by the increases in oil prices, emerged
as the main driver of the rise in inflation in transport services. The depreciation of the Turkish lira
also caused price hikes in other items of services affected by the exchange rate. Services inflation
was also shaped by the strong course of domestic demand.
Alcoholic beverages and tobacco products proved to be the only subcategory that had a lower
contribution to inflation in 2017 compared to the previous year. This was owed to the fact that the
lump-sum special consumption tax on cigarettes and other tobacco products was not hiked as
projected under the automatic pricing mechanism as per the decision of the Council of Ministers.
All in all, aside from cost-side factors which had a major impact on inflation, demand developments
also pushed up inflation in 2017. The depreciating Turkish lira, rising import prices, developments
in food prices and the brisk course of aggregate demand conditions were the leading factors to drive
inflation above the target. Moreover, rising medium-term inflation expectations and the
deterioration of the pricing behavior put an upward pressure on the inflation outlook as well.
Measures Taken to Reach the Inflation Target
Throughout 2017, the CBRT strengthened monetary tightening gradually to contain the worsening
in the inflation outlook (Chart 1). Following the significant global and geopolitical shocks in the
second half of 2016, the volatility in exchange rates became notable in early 2017. This had an
impact on inflation outlook and became the major determinant of the monetary policy decisions at
the start of the year. Accordingly, in the January 2017 meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee
(MPC), lending rates were raised. Moreover, the CBRT adopted a monetary policy framework
entailing dynamic and different liquidity tools in order to safeguard price stability and financial

stability against the possible negative repercussions of excessive volatility observed in the foreign
exchange market in early 2017. In this regard, one-week repo auctions were suspended starting from
12 January 2017. Moreover, various measures were adopted in January to provide flexibility for the
foreign exchange (FX) liquidity management. To this end, foreign exchange reserve requirement
ratios were lowered by 50 basis points for all maturity brackets and the Foreign Exchange Deposits
against Turkish Lira Deposits Market was opened on 17 January 2017 to enhance the flexibility and
instrument diversity of the Turkish lira and FX liquidity management. The CBRT raised the Late
Liquidity Window (LLW) lending rate to 11.75 percent in March, underlining the lagged exchange
rate pass-through, and to 12.25 percent in April in view of the risk that the inflation outlook posed
to the pricing behavior.
Policy decisions taken in the first half of 2017 aimed at alleviating the inflationary pressures. On the
other hand, aggregate demand and credit conditions delayed the improvement in inflation.
Considering the ongoing risks to the pricing behavior due to the elevated levels of inflation and
inflation expectations as well as the core inflation outlook, the CBRT adopted a more cautious tone
in communicating the monetary policy in September and October 2017.

In November 2017, the CBRT adopted a series of liquidity measures in order to safeguard price
stability and financial stability against possible negative effects arising due to the geopolitically
driven exchange rate volatility and the pricing dynamics detached from economic fundamentals.
Thus, starting from 22 November 2017, the funding cost was realized as 12.25 percent.
Additionally, on 6 November 2017, the upper limit of the FX maintenance facility within the
Reserve Options Mechanism was lowered from 60 percent to 55 percent and all tranches were
reduced by 5 points, which offered additional FX liquidity to the banking system. Moreover, the
CBRT’s decision to allow repayments of certain export rediscount credits in Turkish lira at a predetermined exchange rate provided extra FX liquidity for the market. The CBRT launched Turkish

Lira-Settled Forward Foreign Exchange Sale auctions on 20 November 2017 to manage the FX risk
of the real sector effectively.
Noting that the current elevated levels of inflation and the recent cost developments continued to
pose risks to expectations and the pricing behavior, the CBRT decided to tighten the monetary
policy stance further at the December meeting by raising the funding cost to 12.75 percent.
Monetary policy has become considerably more predictable as most of the CBRT funding was
provided through facility single channel in 2017 (Chart 2). In the upcoming period, the CBRT will
continue to use liquidity tools with an appropriate composition and in a manner to support
predictability in line with its objective of achieving price stability. As stated in the MPC statement
of January 2018, the tight stance of the monetary policy will be maintained decisively until the
inflation outlook displays a significant improvement, independent of base effects and temporary
factors, and becomes consistent with the targets.
Given a tight policy stance that focuses on bringing inflation down, inflation is expected to
gradually near the 5-percent target, reach 7.9 percent at the end of 2018 and stabilize around 5
percent over the medium term after falling to 6.5 percent by the end of 2019. Thus, with a 70
percent probability, inflation is expected to be between 6.5 percent and 9.3 percent (with a midpoint of 7.9 percent) at end-2018 and between 4.7 percent and 8.3 percent (with a mid-point of 6.5
percent) at end-2019 (Chart 3).
In 2018, the waning inflationary impact of cumulative exchange rate effects and higher import
prices observed in 2017, is expected to contribute to the downward trend in inflation. Furthermore,
in addition to a more moderate economic activity and a milder loan growth in 2018, a macro policy
framework in which taxes and administered prices are consistent with the Medium-Term Program
through strong coordination of monetary and fiscal policies will support the disinflation process as
well.

Conclusion
In the upcoming period, the CBRT will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the
price stability objective and base all monetary policy decisions on the inflation outlook. Inflation
expectations, the pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored by
the CBRT, and, further monetary tightening will be delivered if needed.
Our experience with inflation targeting and developments in 2017 showed that success in
combatting inflation lies in a holistic approach for macro policy design. Therefore, in order to
achieve permanent price stability, which is a key ingredient for improving social welfare, it is
essential to enhance cooperation among institutions and to constitute coordination between fiscal
and monetary policies on a sustainable basis.
In recent years, various shocks and structural factors have kept inflation volatile and above the
target. In this regard, the CBRT will carry on making efforts in many dimensions, in coordination
with other institutions in order to solve the root cause of the problem. The CBRT will continue to
contribute to studies on structural factors that cause additional inertia and volatility in inflation.
Moreover, studies aiming to increase the domestic value added by reducing the imported inputs in
production and managing the FX risk from a financial stability perspective will also provide a
significant contribution to the effectiveness of monetary policy and the fight against inflation.
Lastly, structural reforms that improve competitiveness and productivity are essential for achieving
permanent price stability over the medium term.
The January 2018 Inflation Report is enclosed for your information, which is published on our
website today, giving a comprehensive account of the developments regarding inflation and
monetary policy as well as our medium-term forecasts.
