The Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) adopted a formal inflation-targeting framework at
the beginning of 2006. Accordingly, the end-year inflation target for 2006 was set as
5 percent, measured by the annual change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). To
facilitate the accountability principle, the CBT has disclosed a quarterly path for 2006
inflation, consistent with the end-year target with an uncertainty band of 2
percentage points on both sides. In adherence with the Article 42 of the Central
Bank law, the CBT committed to provide the Government with a written statement
explaining the reasons for inflation exceeding the upper limit of the uncertainty band
and the measures to be taken to ensure that inflation rate will return to levels within
pre-established limits.
The annual CPI inflation outturn by the end of December 2006 was 9.65,
breaching the upper limit of the uncertainty band announced for end-2006 at 7
percent (Figure 1). This open letter explains the reasons why inflation exceeded the
target by a large margin, evaluates the measures taken by the Central Bank of
Turkey to bring inflation back to the target, and finally presents the medium term
outlook and the horizon in which inflation converges to the target. As mentioned in
our policy statement titled “General Framework of Inflation Targeting and Monetary
and Exchange Rate Policy for 2006” published in December 2005, this Open Letter
will also be presented to the IMF as part of the program conditionality.

The Reasons For Exceeding The Target
The reasons for exceeding the target in year 2006 can be identified by
decomposing the year into pre- and post-May periods. As explained in the Open
Letter published in July 2006, the rise in inflation in the pre-May period can be
attributed to a combination of several supply shocks such as rising oil prices, high
unprocessed food price inflation, and the sustained increases in the gold prices.
Although the relatively strong course of the domestic demand might have been one
of the factors affecting inflation, a careful analysis of the price data and capacity
indicators suggested that the role of the supply factors in breaching the target, by
and large, was dominant in this period.
Inflation dynamics in the post-May period was mainly driven by the exchange
rate pass-through effects of the portfolio shock originated from the change in the
global risk perceptions. The New Turkish Lira (YTL) has shown a tendency to
strengthen since August, yet the domestic currency in the second half of the year
remained significantly weaker than the pre-May period. Cumulative exchange rate
pass-through since May has added around 3.5 percentage points to the headline
inflation—in line with our projections laid out in the June Open Letter. The
accumulated impact of the pass-through has kept the annual inflation at high levels.
The annual inflation in the unprocessed food and energy prices showed signs of
easing in the second half of the year. Although unprocessed food price annual
inflation declined to 13 percent by the end of December from its peak of 21 percent
on June, it still remains at high levels. Consequently, year-end inflation turned out to
be significantly higher than the 5 percent end-year target.
A close look at the last couple of years’ annual inflation in certain subgroups of
the CPI reveals the main factors behind the rise in inflation in 2006. Figure 2 depicts
the dominant role of the unprocessed food prices. High inflation in “goods excluding
energy and unprocessed food” can be largely explained by the exchange rate
movements. The services inflation, on the other hand, exhibited a gradually
declining pattern, confirming that supply side shocks were mainly responsible from
the rise in inflation in 2006.1

Although inflation in services prices has come down in 2006, its contribution on headline inflation appears to
have gone up. This is mainly because of the increasing weight of services in the CPI.

Annual change in the most widely cited core CPI (excluding energy,
unprocessed food, tobacco-alcohol and gold), denoted by H reached 8.9 percent at
the end of the year 2006. It should be noted that since a big fraction of the H index
consists of durable goods, this index is highly sensitive to exchange rate
movements. In that sense, the rise in inflation measured by the H index was
identified as a temporary relative price change rather than a movement in trend
inflation. First round effects of the exchange rate pass-through, which is more
significant in durable goods price inflation, is completed. Indeed, in many of the subgroups of the durable goods, cumulative pass-through started coming down in the
last two months of the year (Table 2).

Measures Taken to Ensure the Convergence of Inflation to the Targets
The volatility in the exchange rates in May and June, coupled with other costpush factors such as strong commodity prices and rising food prices, has led to a
serious deterioration in inflation expectations. Central Bank of Turkey implemented a
two-pillar package as a reaction to the volatility in the financial markets and the
consequent rise in inflation expectations. The first pillar of the policy response was a
rate hike of 400 percentage points in June, which sent the markets a clear signal of
the Central Bank’s commitment to the medium-term inflation targets.
The second pillar of the package was to withdraw the excess domestic
currency liquidity in the financial markets via deposit purchase auctions and FX
sales, while raising the lending rate up by a total of 6 percentage points. By doing
so, the CBT aimed to reduce the potential volatility in the markets by designing a
flexible mechanism to deal with sudden shifts in the market sentiment. The plan
worked well and the financial markets calmed down. Markets reacted favorably to all
these decisive policy measures and the long-end of the yield curve shifted down.
In the following meeting held on July 20th, the Monetary Policy Committee
(MPC) raised the policy rates by a further 25 basis points and stated that a
measured tightening might be necessary to meet 2007 end-year target. By giving
such a signal, the CBT aimed at containing the second round effects of the
exchange rate pass-through and eliminating the gap between inflation expectations
and the medium-term targets.
In the rest of the year, the risks of high inflation in the industrial countries have
eased, decreasing the uncertainty over the global liquidity conditions. The Federal
Reserve’s decision to keep rates on hold has further mitigated the impact of the
May-June sell-off on the domestic markets. Another positive development was the
decline in commodity prices and the signs of a partial “correction” in unprocessed
food prices. Nevertheless, the MPC assessed that these developments would not be
significant enough to change the medium term inflation outlook, since there was still
a considerable amount of uncertainty surrounding the food and the commodity
prices, as well as the global liquidity conditions.
In the meanwhile, the third quarter GDP figures have pointed to a significant
slowdown in the private consumption demand. However, the decline in the overall
growth rate, as it was anticipated in the October Inflation Report, was less
pronounced owing to the increase in government spending and the strong course of
the external demand. Given that the underlying inflation was significantly higher than
the medium term targets, and noting the prevailing uncertainties over the impact of
the large June-July interest rate hikes, the MPC decided to keep rates on hold in the
last 6 consecutive MPC meetings (Table 3). Moreover, the MPC stressed the need
to maintain the tight policy stance in the face of continued global imbalances, high
inflation expectations, and the risks related to services inflation.

The decisive policy measures taken by the CBT and the demonstration of its
firm commitment to the medium term targets helped to contain the inflation
expectations. The deterioration in medium-term expectations stopped in July. Both
the 12-month and the 24-month ahead inflation expectations exhibited a declining
pattern since then (Figure 3). However, the improvement in expectations was
limited, possibly owing to the adaptive behavior of agents coupled with the elevated
headline inflation figures. We forecast the inflation expectations to come down
gradually as inflation decelerates in the medium term. The fact that currently 24month ahead inflation expectations are significantly higher than our medium term
target of 4 percent, however, necessitates a cautious policy stance.

Outlook For Inflation and Monetary Policy
Recent Trends in Inflation
Short-term inflation developments were largely in line with our projections
presented in the July and October Inflation Reports. Having reached its peak at
11.69 percent in July, annual inflation has declined gradually. The 2006 end-year
inflation turned out to be 9.65 percent, which is very close to the midpoints of the
end-2006 forecasts presented in the July Inflation Report (9.85), and October
Inflation Report (9.9). Recent decline in inflation can be partly attributed to the
easing energy and unprocessed food prices; however, it should be also noted that
the core-goods inflation (goods excluding unprocessed food and energy) started to
decline as well. The services inflation, on the other hand, displayed more
persistence. Currently, the annual percentage growth in services prices is around 12
percent. Although our projections point that the services price inflation will decline
gradually; the backward-looking pricing behavior, Balassa-Samuelson effect, and
the recent high wage awards are likely to continue to keep services inflation at high
levels. Our projections point that the contribution of services inflation to the 2007
headline inflation may slightly exceed 2.5 percentage points.
Current State of the Economy
The macroeconomic environment in the last quarter of 2006 has evolved
broadly in line with the outlook set out in the October Inflation Report. Our forecasts
in the June and October Inflation Reports suggested a widening output gap. Indeed,
the GDP growth rate slowed down and the output gap has widened in the second
half of the year as expected (Figure 4). Accordingly, we envisage that contribution of
the demand conditions to the disinflation process has increased.

Global economic growth has become more balanced across regions, with
some deceleration in the US and resilient growth elsewhere. Domestic demand in
the Euro area has maintained its momentum and therefore continued to provide
support for our exports, which was a largely anticipated development in our October
Inflation Report.
Recall that, the October forecast assumed that risk premium would stay
unchanged, unprocessed food prices would normalize, and oil prices would remain
constant. There was no significant change in the risk premium since October. Some
“correction” in unprocessed food prices has been witnessed, although not as
significant as predicted. On the other hand, oil prices continued to surprise on the
favorable side. Accordingly, we have revised our oil price assumption down from 60
to 55 USD per barrel. However, our forecasts still incorporate the estimated impact
of accumulated past increases in oil prices on regulated prices such as natural gas
and electricity.
The decline in the inflation expectations has continued to tighten the monetary
conditions in the last quarter of 2006. Longer-term interest rates such as the interest
rates on government securities and consumer loans stayed at higher levels.
Although some uncertainties remain over the impact of the policy rates on economic
activity, it is reasonable to assume that current financial conditions and monetary
policy stance in Turkey are non-accommodative.

The third quarter GDP figures have revealed a significant slowdown in the
private consumption demand. The significant slowdown in credit expansion and the
notable decline in the growth rate of monetary indicators continued in the last
quarter of 2006. Credit expansion has almost stopped in the second half of the year
(Table 4). Automobile sales registered a sharp decline in the third quarter. Although
there has been some recovery in the last quarter of 2006, annual growth rate in
automobile sales is still significantly negative. Consumer confidence index fell in
June and July before it rebounded modestly in the last couple of months.
In sum, recent indicators suggest a considerable slowdown in the private
consumption, especially in interest rate sensitive items such as car sales and
housing. The slowdown in the aggregate demand, however, has been less
significant, mainly owing to the robust external demand and the noticeable rise in

7

Central Bank of Turkey

non-interest public expenditures (Table 5). In other words, the increase in
government spending has partly offset the impact of the tight monetary stance in the
latter part of 2006. Seasonally adjusted figures for the capacity utilization rate and
the industrial production indices suggest that although there is some modest
recovery in the last quarter, the growth rate in the economic activity was significantly
lower than the post-2001 average.

Outlook
We expect aggregate demand conditions to support the underlying disinflation
process in the next couple of quarters. Although the exports are likely to grow faster
than the imports in the first half of the year, our projections suggest that the modest
growth in the private domestic demand will continue to hold the GDP growth rate at
levels below the previous years. We envisage that the non-accommodative
monetary conditions and the slowdown in economic activity will limit the secondround effects of the supply shocks witnessed in 2006.
Another factor that could contribute bringing inflation down in 2007 is the high
base created by the supply shocks cited above. The normalization of food, energy
and other commodity prices together with the disappearance of the base effect of
exchange rate pass-through have the potential to drive a sizeable reduction in
annual inflation, especially starting from the second quarter of 2007.
Inflation in services prices has been quite persistent, possibly due to the
presence of backward-looking pricing behavior and relatively low productivity in the
services sector. Also, the recent pension and minimum wage increases together
with the civil service wage hikes put an upside pressure on services and overall
inflation.
Against this background, bringing inflation back to the target of 4 percent
necessitates a tight policy stance. Assuming that the policy rate is unchanged for the
next three quarters and gradually eased thereafter, we forecast inflation to be
between 3.6 and 6.6 percent (mid-point 5.1) at the end of 2007 and between 1.6 and
5.2 percent (midpoint 3.4) by the end of 2008, with 70 percent probability (Figure 5).
We expect the downward trend in inflation to become more pronounced in the
second and third quarter of 2007. Our projections suggest that it may take around 5
quarters to converge to target. It should be stressed that both the inflation forecast
and the underlying policy path is conditional on the currently available information,
and therefore, subject to change as new information arrives.

* The shaded region indicates the 70 percent confidence interval for the forecast.

To sum up, since macroeconomic developments have evolved in line with the
outlook presented in the October Inflation Report, there has been no significant
revision in our medium term forecasts and the underlying policy perspective.
Risks
The main risk factor for the medium term inflation outlook can be listed as
higher-than-expected inflation inertia, as currently manifested in the medium term
inflation expectations. Given that we plan to bring inflation down from 10 percent to 4
percent in a fairly short period of time, the degree of stickiness in services inflation
emerges as a major risk to our forecast, especially if one considers the recent real
wage awards. Realization of such a risk could require keeping the tight policy stance
longer than envisaged in our baseline forecasts. Accordingly, we will continue to
keep a close eye on the services price inflation along with various core inflation
measures.
Another risk for the inflation outlook is the uncertainty regarding impact of
monetary policy on the aggregate demand. Lags in monetary policy transmission are
time variant, and the Turkish economy is no exception. The sizeable slowdown in
the third quarter of 2006 was a result of lower confidence due to financial market
volatility in May-June period, rather than an outcome of tightened monetary policy.
Although the tightening exercised since June 2006 started to be effective on the
interest-sensitive private demand recently, the extent and the duration of the
slowdown in the overall economic activity remains to be seen. Uncertainties are also
related to the behavior of government spending, which could represent an upside

9

Central Bank of Turkey

risk to the aggregate demand, and therefore inflation in 2007. In this respect, the
MPC has been closely monitoring the macroeconomic impact of the developments
in the incomes policy as well as the public sector non-interest expenditures.
A third risk factor that may put delay in attaining the medium term targets is the
possibility of a sudden change in the global financial market sentiment. Global
liquidity is still the major factor in shaping risk appetite and volatility in financial
markets. Currently the concerns over high inflation and thus higher interest rates in
the United States seem to have diminished. However, a sharper-than-envisaged
slowdown in the world economy or disorderly developments owing to global
imbalances still remain as possible scenarios that may lead to another wave of
portfolio shock in emerging markets. It should be stressed that in June we have
designed a flexible tool to cope with such possible sudden changes in the market
sentiment. The current liquidity conditions in the domestic money market allow us to
engineer a rapid tightening in operational policy rates between the two MPC
meetings. We have already announced in our policy statements that the CBT will not
hesitate to resort to this kind of tightening, should the market conditions exhibit a
sharp but temporary deterioration. In case the deterioration turns out to have lasting
effects on the medium term inflation outlook, the MPC will revise the borrowing rates
upwards.
It is worth to note that, not all the scenarios regarding the global outlook are
unfavorable for our economy. Turkey is a net commodity importer. Although a
slowdown in the global economic growth or a further easing in commodity prices
could have an immediate adverse impact on the domestic inflation through its impact
on the global risk appetite, it will also lead to a positive terms of trade shock and
thus to a more favorable outlook in the medium term.

Conclusion
Although the accumulated impact of the various cost-push shocks combined
with the continued exchange rate pass-through has kept inflation at high levels, the
policy we have conducted since June 2006 has been successful in containing
inflation and inflation expectations. Inflation is already down to single digits from its
peak of 11.69 percent in July 2006; however, it is still significantly above the medium
term target of 4 percent. Given the prevailing uncertainties over the medium term
outlook, monetary policy needs to remain tight to ensure the convergence to
medium term targets. That is why we will conduct monetary policy with a tightening
bias in the period ahead. In other words, monetary policy will stay more attentive to
adverse developments than favorable developments regarding inflation outlook. This
approach reflects our commitment to achieving the medium term inflation target.

It should be stressed that an appropriate monetary policy is a necessary but
not a sufficient condition for achieving long run price stability. Attaining high primary
surpluses have been central for the disinflation process in the past years.
Maintaining and advancing the gains achieved thus far requires the continuation of
the European Union accession process, and the implementation of structural
reforms that would ensure the sustainability of fiscal discipline in the long run.
