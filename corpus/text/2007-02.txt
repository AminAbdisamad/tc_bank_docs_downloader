The Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) adopted a formal inf lation-targeting framework at 
the beginning of 2006. Accordingly, the end-year infl ation target for 2006 was set as 
5 percent, measured by the annual change in the Consume r Price Index (CPI). To 
facilitate the accountability principle, the CBT has discl osed a quarterly path for 2006 
inflation, consistent with the end-year target with an  uncertainty band of 2 
percentage points on both sides. In adherence with the A rticle 42 of the Central 
Bank law, the CBT committed to provide the Government w ith a written statement 
explaining the reasons for inflation exceeding the upper  limit of the uncertainty band 
and the measures to be taken to ensure that inflation r ate will return to levels within 
pre-established limits. 
The annual CPI inflation outturn by the end of Decem ber 2006 was 9.65, 
breaching the upper limit of the uncertainty band ann ounced for end-2006 at 7 
percent (Figure 1). This open letter explains the reason s why inflation exceeded the 
target by a large margin, evaluates the measures taken b y the Central Bank of 
Turkey to bring inflation back to the target, and fina lly presents the medium term 
outlook and the horizon in which inflation converges to the target. As mentioned in 
our policy statement titled “General Framework of Infl ation Targeting and Monetary 
and Exchange Rate Policy for 2006” published in December  2005, this Open Letter 
will also be presented to the IMF as part of the progr am conditionality.

The Reasons For Exceeding The Target 
The reasons for exceeding the target in year 2006 can be  identified by 
decomposing the year into pre- and post-May periods. As explained in the Open 
Letter published in July 2006, the rise in inflation i n the pre-May period can be 
attributed to a combination of several supply shocks such as r ising oil prices, high 
unprocessed food price inflation, and the sustained increa ses in the gold prices. 
Although the relatively strong course of the domestic dem and might have been one 
of the factors affecting inflation, a careful analysis of  the price data and capacity 
indicators suggested that the role of the supply factors i n breaching the target, by 
and large, was dominant in this period. 
Inflation dynamics in the post-May period was mainly dr iven by the exchange 
rate pass-through effects of the portfolio shock originate d from the change in the 
global risk perceptions. The New Turkish Lira (YTL) has sho wn a tendency to 
strengthen since August, yet the domestic currency in the se cond half of the year 
remained significantly weaker than the pre-May period.  Cumulative exchange rate 
pass-through since May has added around 3.5 percentage po ints to the headline 
inflation—in line with our projections laid out in the  June Open Letter. The 
accumulated impact of the pass-through has kept the annual  inflation at high levels. 
The annual inflation in the unprocessed food and energ y prices showed signs of 
easing in the second half of the year. Although unproce ssed food price annual 
inflation declined to 13 percent by the end of Decembe r from its peak of 21 percent 
on June, it still remains at high levels. Consequently, y ear-end inflation turned out to 
be significantly higher than the 5 percent end-year ta rget. 
A close look at the last couple of years’ annual inflatio n in certain subgroups of 
the CPI reveals the main factors behind the rise in infl ation in 2006. Figure 2 depicts 
the dominant role of the unprocessed food prices. High i nflation in “goods excluding 
energy and unprocessed food” can be largely explained by  the exchange rate 
movements. The services inflation, on the other hand, exhi bited a gradually 
declining pattern, confirming that supply side shocks were mainly responsible from 
the rise in inflation in 2006. 1

Annual change in the most widely cited core CPI (excludin g energy, 
unprocessed food, tobacco-alcohol and gold), denoted by H  reached 8.9 percent at 
the end of the year 2006. It should be noted that sin ce a big fraction of the H index 
consists of durable goods, this index is highly sensitive to e xchange rate 
movements. In that sense, the rise in inflation measured by the H index was 
identified as a temporary relative price change rather than a movement in trend 
inflation. First round effects of the exchange rate pass- through, which is more 
significant in durable goods price inflation, is complete d. Indeed, in many of the sub-
groups of the durable goods, cumulative pass-through start ed coming down in the 
last two months of the year (Table 2).

Measures Taken to Ensure the Convergence of Inflati on to the Targets  
The volatility in the exchange rates in May and June, cou pled with other cost-
push factors such as strong commodity prices and rising food p rices, has led to a 
serious deterioration in inflation expectations. Central  Bank of Turkey implemented a 
two-pillar package as a reaction to the volatility in th e financial markets and the 
consequent rise in inflation expectations. The first pilla r of the policy response was a 
rate hike of 400 percentage points in June, which sent th e markets a clear signal of 
the Central Bank’s commitment to the medium-term infla tion targets. 
The second pillar of the package was to withdraw the excess domestic 
currency liquidity in the financial markets via deposit pu rchase auctions and FX 
sales, while raising the lending rate up by a total of  6 percentage points. By doing 
so, the CBT aimed to reduce  the potential volatility in the markets by designing a 
flexible mechanism to deal with sudden shifts in the marke t sentiment. The plan 
worked well and the financial markets calmed down. Market s reacted favorably to all 
these decisive policy measures and the long-end of the yie ld curve shifted down. 
In the following meeting held on July 20th, the Mone tary Policy Committee 
(MPC) raised the policy rates by a further 25 basis poin ts and stated that a 
measured tightening might be necessary to meet 2007 end -year target. By giving 
such a signal, the CBT aimed at containing the second rou nd effects of the 
exchange rate pass-through and eliminating the gap betw een inflation expectations 
and the medium-term targets. 
In the rest of the year, the risks of high inflation in  the industrial countries have 
eased, decreasing the uncertainty over the global liquid ity conditions. The Federal 
Reserve’s decision to keep rates on hold has further mitiga ted the impact of the 
May-June sell-off on the domestic markets. Another positive  development was the 
decline in commodity prices and the signs of a partial “co rrection” in unprocessed 
food prices. Nevertheless, the MPC assessed that these develop ments would not be 
significant enough to change the medium term inflation  outlook, since there was still 
a considerable amount of uncertainty surrounding the fo od and the commodity 
prices, as well as the global liquidity conditions. 
In the meanwhile, the third quarter GDP figures have pointed to a significant 
slowdown in the private consumption demand. However, the  decline in the overall 
growth rate, as it was anticipated in the October Infla tion Report, was less 
pronounced owing to the increase in government spending and the strong course of 
the external demand. Given that the underlying inflat ion was significantly higher than 
the medium term targets, and noting the prevailing un certainties over the impact of 
the large June-July interest rate hikes, the MPC decided to keep rates on hold in the 
last 6 consecutive MPC meetings (Table 3). Moreover, the M PC stressed the need 
to maintain the tight policy stance in the face of conti nued global imbalances, high 
inflation expectations, and the risks related to services inf lation.

The decisive policy measures taken by the CBT and the demo nstration of its 
firm commitment to the medium term targets helped to contain the inflation 
expectations. The deterioration in medium-term expectati ons stopped in July. Both 
the 12-month and the 24-month ahead inflation expecta tions exhibited a declining 
pattern since then (Figure 3). However, the improvement  in expectations was 
limited, possibly owing to the adaptive behavior of age nts coupled with the elevated 
headline inflation figures. We forecast the inflation expectations to come down 
gradually as inflation decelerates in the medium term.  The fact that currently 24-
month ahead inflation expectations are significantly hig her than our medium term 
target of 4 percent, however, necessitates a cautious policy  stance.

Outlook For Inflation and Monetary Policy 
Recent Trends in Inflation  
Short-term inflation developments were largely in lin e with our projections 
presented in the July and October Inflation Reports. Ha ving reached its peak at 
11.69 percent in July, annual inflation has declined gr adually. The 2006 end-year 
inflation turned out to be 9.65 percent, which is very close to the midpoints of the 
end-2006 forecasts presented in the July Inflation Repor t (9.85), and October 
Inflation Report (9.9). Recent decline in inflation ca n be partly attributed to the 
easing energy and unprocessed food prices; however, it shou ld be also noted that 
the core-goods inflation (goods excluding unprocessed food and energy) started to 
decline as well. The services inflation, on the other han d, displayed more 
persistence. Currently, the annual percentage growth in  services prices is around 12 
percent. Although our projections point that the services price inflation will decline 
gradually; the backward-looking pricing behavior, Balassa- Samuelson effect, and 
the recent high wage awards are likely to continue to ke ep services inflation at high 
levels. Our projections point that the contribution of se rvices inflation to the 2007 
headline inflation may slightly exceed 2.5 percentage p oints. 
Current State of the Economy    
The macroeconomic environment in the last quarter of 200 6 has evolved 
broadly in line with the outlook set out in the Octobe r Inflation Report. Our forecasts 
in the June and October Inflation Reports suggested a wi dening output gap. Indeed, 
the GDP growth rate slowed down and the output gap h as widened in the second 
half of the year as expected (Figure 4). Accordingly, we  envisage that contribution of 
the demand conditions to the disinflation process has incre ased.

Global economic growth has become more balanced across regi ons, with 
some deceleration in the US and resilient growth elsewh ere. Domestic demand in 
the Euro area has maintained its momentum and therefo re continued to provide 
support for our exports, which was a largely anticipated development in our October 
Inflation Report. 
Recall that, the October forecast assumed that risk premium  would stay 
unchanged, unprocessed food prices would normalize, and o il prices would remain 
constant. There was no significant change in the risk premi um since October. Some 
“correction” in unprocessed food prices has been witnessed, a lthough not as 
significant as predicted. On the other hand, oil prices co ntinued to surprise on the 
favorable side. Accordingly, we have revised our oil price assumption down from 60 
to 55 USD per barrel. However, our forecasts still incorp orate the estimated impact 
of accumulated past increases in oil prices on regulated pr ices such as natural gas 
and electricity. 
The decline in the inflation expectations has continued t o tighten the monetary 
conditions in the last quarter of 2006. Longer-term in terest rates such as the interest 
rates on government securities and consumer loans stayed at higher levels. 
Although some uncertainties remain over the impact of th e policy rates on economic 
activity, it is reasonable to assume that current financial  conditions and monetary 
policy stance in Turkey are non-accommodative.

The third quarter GDP figures have revealed a significan t slowdown in the 
private consumption demand. The significant slowdown in cr edit expansion and the 
notable decline in the growth rate of monetary indica tors continued in the last 
quarter of 2006. Credit expansion has almost stopped in the second half of the year 
(Table 4). Automobile sales registered a sharp decline i n the third quarter. Although 
there has been some recovery in the last quarter of 2006 , annual growth rate in 
automobile sales is still significantly negative. Consumer confidence index fell in 
June and July before it rebounded modestly in the last couple of months. 
In sum, recent indicators suggest a considerable slowdown in  the private 
consumption, especially in interest rate sensitive items such as car sales and 
housing. The slowdown in the a ggregate  demand, however, has been less 
significant, mainly owing to the robust external demand  and the noticeable rise in                                                                                                            Central Bank of Turkey  
 8non-interest public expenditures (Table 5). In other wo rds, the increase in 
government spending has partly offset the impact of the tight monetary stance in the 
latter part of 2006. Seasonally adjusted figures for t he capacity utilization rate and 
the industrial production indices suggest that although t here is some modest 
recovery in the last quarter, the growth rate in the e conomic activity was significantly 
lower than the post-2001 average.

Outlook  
We expect aggregate demand conditions to support the und erlying disinflation 
process in the next couple of quarters. Although the expor ts are likely to grow faster 
than the imports in the first half of the year, our p rojections suggest that the modest 
growth in the private domestic demand will continue to hold the GDP growth rate at 
levels below the previous years. We envisage that the non- accommodative 
monetary conditions and the slowdown in economic activity  will limit the second-
round effects of the supply shocks witnessed in 2006. 
Another factor that could contribute bringing inflatio n down in 2007 is the high 
base created by the supply shocks cited above. The normaliza tion of food, energy 
and other commodity prices together with the disappeara nce of the base effect of 
exchange rate pass-through have the potential to drive a sizeable reduction in 
annual inflation, especially starting from the second qu arter of 2007. 
Inflation in services prices has been quite persistent, possib ly due to the 
presence of backward-looking pricing behavior and relativel y low productivity in the 
services sector. Also, the recent pension and minimum wage i ncreases together 
with the civil service wage hikes put an upside pressure on se rvices and overall 
inflation.  
Against this background, bringing inflation back to the t arget of 4 percent 
necessitates a tight policy stance. Assuming that the policy rate is unchanged for the 
next three quarters and gradually eased thereafter, we  forecast inflation to be 
between 3.6 and 6.6 percent (mid-point 5.1) at the e nd of 2007 and between 1.6 and 
5.2 percent (midpoint 3.4) by the end of 2008, with 70 percent probability (Figure 5). 
We expect the downward trend in inflation to become mo re pronounced in the 
second and third quarter of 2007. Our projections suggest  that it may take around 5 
quarters to converge to target. It should be stressed that  both the inflation forecast 
and the underlying policy path is conditional on the cu rrently available information, 
and therefore, subject to change as new information arr ives.

To sum up, since macroeconomic developments have evolved in li ne with the 
outlook presented in the October Inflation Report, the re has been no significant 
revision in our medium term forecasts and the underlying  policy perspective. 
Risks 
The main risk factor for the medium term inflation out look can be listed as 
higher-than-expected inflation inertia, as currently ma nifested in the medium term 
inflation expectations. Given that we plan to bring inf lation down from 10 percent to 4 
percent in a fairly short period of time, the degree of stickiness in services inflation 
emerges as a major risk to our forecast, especially if one considers the recent real 
wage awards. Realization of such a risk could require keep ing the tight policy stance 
longer than envisaged in our baseline forecasts. Accordingl y, we will continue to 
keep a close eye on the services price inflation along with  various core inflation 
measures. 
Another risk for the inflation outlook is the uncertaint y regarding impact of 
monetary policy on the aggregate demand. Lags in mone tary policy transmission are 
time variant, and the Turkish economy is no exception. The  sizeable slowdown in 
the third quarter of 2006 was a result of lower confid ence due to financial market 
volatility in May-June period, rather than an outcome of tightened monetary policy. 
Although the tightening exercised since June 2006 started to be effective on the 
interest-sensitive private demand recently, the extent and  the duration of the 
slowdown in the overall economic activity remains to be see n. Uncertainties are also 
related to the behavior of government spending, which co uld represent an upside                                                                                                            Central Bank of Turkey  
 10 risk to the aggregate demand, and therefore inflation  in 2007. In this respect, the 
MPC has been closely monitoring the macroeconomic impact o f the developments 
in the incomes policy as well as the public sector non-inte rest expenditures. 
A third risk factor that may put delay in attaining th e medium term targets is the 
possibility of a sudden change in the global financial m arket sentiment. Global 
liquidity is still the major factor in shaping risk appet ite and volatility in financial 
markets. Currently the concerns over high inflation and t hus higher interest rates in 
the United States seem to have diminished. However, a sha rper-than-envisaged 
slowdown in the world economy or disorderly development s owing to global 
imbalances still remain as possible scenarios that may lead to another wave of 
portfolio shock in emerging markets. It should be stressed t hat in June we have 
designed a flexible tool to cope with such possible sudden changes in the market 
sentiment. The current liquidity conditions in the dome stic money market allow us to 
engineer a rapid tightening in operational policy ra tes between the two MPC 
meetings. We have already announced in our policy statem ents that the CBT will not 
hesitate to resort to this kind of tightening, should th e market conditions exhibit a 
sharp but temporary deterioration. In case the deterio ration turns out to have lasting 
effects on the medium term inflation outlook, the MPC will revise the borrowing rates 
upwards. 
It is worth to note that, not all the scenarios regardi ng the global outlook are 
unfavorable for our economy. Turkey is a net commodity i mporter. Although a 
slowdown in the global economic growth or a further ea sing in commodity prices 
could have an immediate adverse impact on the domestic inf lation through its impact 
on the global risk appetite, it will also lead to a po sitive terms of trade shock and 
thus to a more favorable outlook in the medium term. 
 
Conclusion 
Although the accumulated impact of the various cost-push sho cks combined 
with the continued exchange rate pass-through has kept inf lation at high levels, the 
policy we have conducted since June 2006 has been successful in containing 
inflation and inflation expectations. Inflation is alre ady down to single digits from its 
peak of 11.69 percent in July 2006; however, it is still significantly above the medium 
term target of 4 percent. Given the prevailing uncertai nties over the medium term 
outlook, monetary policy needs to remain tight to ensur e the convergence to 
medium term targets. That is why we will conduct moneta ry policy with a tightening 
bias in the period ahead. In other words, monetary po licy will stay more attentive to 
adverse developments than favorable developments regarding  inflation outlook. This 
approach reflects our commitment to achieving the medium term inflation target.

It should be stressed that an appropriate monetary poli cy is a necessary but 
not a sufficient condition for achieving long run price st ability. Attaining high primary 
surpluses have been central for the disinflation process in the past years. 
Maintaining and advancing the gains achieved thus far req uires the continuation of 
the European Union accession process, and the implementati on of structural 
reforms that would ensure the sustainability of fiscal di scipline in the long run.
