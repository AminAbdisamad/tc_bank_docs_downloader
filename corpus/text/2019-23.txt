The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo
auction rate) constant at 24 percent.
Recently released data show that rebalancing trend in the economy has continued. External demand
maintains its relative strength while economic activity displays a slow pace, partly due to tight financial
conditions. Current account balance is expected to maintain its improving trend.
Developments in domestic demand conditions and the tight monetary policy support disinflation. In order
to contain the risks to the pricing behavior and to reinforce the disinflation process, the Committee has
decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance.
The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective.
Factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, monetary stance will be determined to keep
inflation in line with the targeted path.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days.
