Policy” in the 3rd Research Conference held by the National Bank of the Republic of
Macedonia on Monday, 28 April 2014 at 10:10 a.m. local time in Turkey.
Governor Başçı emphasized the following points:
•

Retail loan growth continues to slow down in response to the tight monetary
policy stance, recent macroprudential measures, and weak capital flows.

•

The impact of monetary tightening on inflation will be observed with some lag.
Meanwhile, inflation is expected to peak in May, partly reflecting the base
effects.

•

Exports will support growth while private final domestic demand will lose
momentum.

•

The current account deficit will improve substantially in 2014.
