DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Participating Committee Members
Murat Çetinkaya (Governor), Ahmet Faruk Aysan, Erkan Kilimci, Murat Uysal, Abdullah Yavaş.

The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows:
a)
Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been reduced from 8.75 percent to 8.5 percent,
and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.25 percent,
b)
One-week repo rate has been kept at 7.5 percent,
c)
Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept
at 0 percent, and lending rate has been reduced from 10.25 percent to 10 percent.
Annual loan growth continues at reasonable rates in response to the tight monetary policy stance and
macroprudential measures. Although developments in tourism revenues will have a negative impact in the
short run, the lagged effects of the developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer
loans will continue to contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. While domestic demand
is having a positive impact on growth, albeit at a lesser extent, demand from the European Union economies
continues to support exports. Accordingly, economic activity displays a moderate and stable course of growth.
The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural reforms would contribute to the potential
growth significantly.
The adverse impact of domestic developments in mid-July on market indicators has been largely reversed due
to improved global risk appetite and the recent measures. Moreover, the tight monetary policy stance, the
cautious macroprudential policies and the effective use of the policy instruments laid out in the road map
published in August 2015 have increased the resilience of the economy against shocks. Also considering its
contribution to the effectiveness of monetary policy, the Committee decided to take a measured and cautious
step towards simplification.
Unprocessed food prices, which have recently shown marked increases, are projected to display a downward
correction in the short term. Meanwhile, the core inflation trend is expected to improve gradually. Yet, the
developments in the inflation outlook necessitate the maintenance of a tight liquidity stance.
Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation
expectations, pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy
stance will be maintained.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days.
