 1November Inflation and Outlook 
 
I. GENERAL EVALUATION 
 
1. According to the indices with base year 2003, the C PI increased by 1.40 percent, 
while the PPI dropped by 0.95 in November. Annual i nflation in the CPI and PPI 
became 7.61 percent and 1.60 percent, respectively (Graph 1). 
2. In November, the special CPI aggregate F, which exc ludes energy, alcoholic 
beverages, tobacco products, other goods with admin istered prices and indirect 
taxes, increased by 1.93 percent in monthly terms, while the G index, obtained by 
excluding unprocessed food from the F index, displa yed a 0.88 percent-increase 
(Table 1). The year-on-year increase in November fo r these indices became 6.87 
percent and 6.27 percent, respectively.  
3. In November, agricultural prices increased by 2.11 percent, whereas the PPI 
excluding agriculture (industrial prices) fell by 1 .74 percent (Table 1).

Developments in Consumer Prices 
4. The monthly price increase in food and non-alcoholi c beverages became 3.27 
percent. The main determinant in this development w as the increases in fresh fruit 
and vegetables, which were realized significantly a bove the seasonal tendencies.  
5. The prices in the clothing and footwear group, whic h increased at a high rate in 
October due to the effect of new season products, r ose by 3.53 percent in 
November, maintaining their seasonal tendency. The year-end rate of increase of the 
group prices, which displayed a 0.46 percent increa se in the first eleven months of 
the year, is expected to be realized considerably b elow the general inflation target. 
6.  The monthly price increase in the housing group bec ame 1.05 percent. The main 
determinants of the increase in housing prices were  the increases in rent and natural 
gas prices that rose by 1.17 percent and 4.34 perce nt, respectively.  3Source: TSI (2003=100) 
 
7. In November, prices of household goods rose by 0.85  percent mainly due to the 
increase by 2.26 percent in furniture prices, which  had substantially risen in the 
previous month as well. The high-rated increases in  furniture manufacturing, which 
can be an indicator for the demand for consumption goods, should particularly be 
noted. It is believed that the domestic demand-pric e relationship is stronger in this 
sector due to the facts that this sector is relativ ely closed to foreign competition and 
it utilizes low imported input. In this framework, the increase in the furniture 
manufacturing sector by 32.1 percent in nine months  of the year, compared to same 
period last year, and the fact that furniture price s remained above the general 
inflation level rising by a high rate of 13.4 perce nt cumulatively, in the January-
November period, point to a decline in the contribu tion of domestic demand to the 
falling inflation.  
8. Prices in the transportation group declined by 0.82  percent in November. This 
drop mainly stemmed from the decline in items that were directly influenced by oil 
prices. 
9. It is observed that prices in restaurants and hotel s still maintain their upward 
trend in November and that the eleven-month cumulat ive increase of 14.40 percent 
in the said group in 2005 is above its level of 200 4.

10.  Along with the 0.95 percent decrease in producer p rices in November, the 
cumulative increase in the PPI was realized as 2.71  percent during the first eleven 
months of the year.   
11. Agricultural prices maintain their upward trend due  to seasonal effects. With 
the 2.11 percent increase in November, the annual p rice increase in the agriculture 
sector was realized as 1.56 percent. The increase i n agricultural prices is expected to 
continue in the coming months.    
12. Manufacturing industry prices decreased by 1.86 per cent in November. The 
main determinant in this decrease was the 12.02 dec line in prices of petroleum 
products, especially in line with developments in i nternational markets. Moreover, 
annual increase in the manufacturing industry price s, excluding petroleum products, 
maintained its downward trend in November. As to th e energy group, the upsurge in 
natural gas prices is considerable.

  5II. OUTLOOK 
 
Inflation Developments 
13. November inflation was realized above market expect ations due to high 
increases in food prices resulting from seasonal mo vements. The increase in fruit and 
vegetables, which were realized about nine points a bove the November 2004 figures, 
became the main determinant in this development. Ne arly 3.13 percent of the 3.27 
percent increase in the food and non-alcoholic beve rages item stemmed from the 
high increase in fruit and vegetables prices. The i ncrease in the said sub-items (fruit 
and vegetables) consisted of about 1.22 points of N ovember inflation. Excluding 
seasonal factors, it is clear that November price d evelopments do not seem to impair 
the general inflation outlook expressed in the prev ious report.  
14. In the new period, in which the inflation-targeting  regime will be 
implemented, it is crucial that all Central Bank re ports to be read carefully in order to 
fully understand the future stance of monetary poli cy. Monetary policy implemented 
by the Central Bank should be related to future inf lation, not to the realized figure. 
Although this issue was repeatedly emphasized throu gh reports, presentations and 
assessments in the last four years, it is evident t hat it was not fully understood by 
the public. The existence of questions such as “How  can the 2006 target be achieved 
when the inflation figure of the last four months i s 5.17 percent?” compels this issue 
to be emphasized over and over. The Central Bank ha s repeatedly announced that 
factors, such as indirect taxes, oil effect and sea sonality have been the determinants 
in inflation developments of the last four months. 
15. Another point, which is not fully understood by the  public, is that producer 
prices are not the target. Taking the PPI increase as a target in the fight against 
inflation is out of the question, because the produ cer prices do not measure the daily 
cost of living of economic agents. It should be rep eated once more that the Central 
Bank’s definition of inflation is the inflation rat e, which is calculated by the 
percentage change of the Consumer Price Index with base year 2003. 
Comprehension of this definition by the public duri ng the inflation-targeting period is 
of great importance in order for them to accurately  understand the Central Bank’s  6messages. Undoubtedly, producer prices may contain information about the inflation 
of the coming period, since they are cost indicator s for the retail sector. Therefore, 
the course of producer price increases at historica lly low levels during the last period 
gives favorable signals for inflation in the upcomi ng period. Nevertheless, it should 
be borne in mind that producer prices may change ra pidly due to cost conditions and 
hence, the value of information it contains about t he future tendency of inflation is 
limited. While evaluating the realized inflation fi gures as regards inflation in the 
upcoming period, the CPI indicators that are calcul ated by excluding temporary and 
external effects contain much more helpful informat ion. 
16. It should not be overlooked the November inflation that excluding seasonal 
products (various food and clothing products having  variable weight within the 
index), was realized as merely 0.05 percent and tha t the said increase was the 
lowest monthly increase throughout 2005. Undoubtedl y, the relatively low increases 
in services prices and the effect of the slackening  oil prices have assisted inflation in 
November. However, the decline of the index, which excludes energy, services and 
seasonal products, on monthly basis, indicates that  the November figures do not 
point to a rise in inflation, but signal a decline in inflation. 
17. It is observed that the annual rates of increase of  the special CPI aggregate F, 
which excludes energy, alcoholic beverages, tobacco  products, other goods with 
administered prices and indirect taxes and the G in dex obtained by excluding 
unprocessed food from the F index shift between 6 p ercent and 7 percent. The index 
(E*) obtained by excluding seasonal products from t he E index, which excludes 
energy, alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, d ropped to 6.40 percent, 
maintaining its gradual decrease in the last period  (Graph 1), These figures point to a 
decline in the short-term tendency of inflation.  
Factors Affecting Inflation  
18. The medium-term trend of inflation is shaped by exp ectations, supply-demand 
balance, costs and developments in pricing behavior s. Recently, developments in 
consumer confidence indices and data on white goods  – automobile sales show that 
consumption demand is following a stable path. Anal yzing foreign trade data, it is  7observed that imports of consumption goods increase d in seasonally adjusted terms 
in the third quarter of the year, but re-stabilized  afterwards. Similar trends apply to 
domestic sales of automobiles and white goods. In s easonally adjusted terms, white 
goods sales and domestic sales of automobiles, whic h had lost its pace but 
nevertheless continued to increase in the third qua rter of the year compared to the 
previous period, declined in September and October.  Hence, data for October signal 
that the recovery in consumption expenditures will not accelerate and remain at its 
current level in the last quarter. However, data pe rtaining to the last two months of 
the year will be particularly significant in order to be able to assess the course of 
domestic demand more clearly, since the effect of R amadan on demand has not 
been thoroughly assessed. In short, no marked incre ase has been observed in 
consumption demand, excluding the household goods s ector, recently. On the other 
hand, increase in the household sector is believed to be related to the recovery in 
the housing market.  
19. Meanwhile, the continuance of investment-oriented g rowth is deemed to be a 
favorable development in terms of future inflation.  Current indicators show that 
machinery-equipment investments accelerated, especi ally in the second half of the 
year, compared to the first half. In seasonally adj usted terms, machinery-equipment 
manufacturing and imports of capital goods increase d in the third quarter of the year 
compared to the previous period, and the favorable course of investment 
expenditures for the next  twelve-month period continued in November. These 
developments are perceived to indicate that the abo ve-mentioned tendency will 
continue.  
20. Recently announced data on employment and unemploym ent is also 
significant in terms of demand and inflation in the  medium term. What should be 
noted in the first place is that the annual decline  in total employment observed in the 
third quarter of the year does not indicate a deter ioration in the employment trend. 
Structural transformation, which has led to a chang e in the shares of employment 
sectors to the detriment of the agriculture sector,  has reduced employment in the 
agriculture sector and restrained the increase in t otal employment, accordingly. 
However, the continuance of high increases in emplo yment, excluding agriculture, on  8a year-on-year basis shows that the recovery in eco nomic activity supports 
employment. Private sector employment, excluding ag riculture, has been increasing 
at an accelerated pace since the second quarter of 2004 in a stable manner, which is 
a desired development in terms of the potential of the economy to create 
employment. Meanwhile, medium-term effects of this development on demand and 
inflation developments should also be carefully eva luated.  
21. There has not been any development in foreign deman d indicators that would 
change the outlook of previous months. It is observ ed that annual increases in 
exports of textile and clothing sectors, which have  been adversely affected by 
increased foreign competition, continue at a lower pace. Rapid increases in exports 
of machinery-equipment also continue. It is anticip ated that the increases in exports 
will continue in the short run, but ongoing increas es in imports will restrain the 
contribution of net foreign demand to growth. It is  likely that increases in imports will 
lose pace in the medium term as both investment and  consumption will be saturated 
and the effect of high increases in prices of impor ted raw materials will decrease. It 
is foreseen that the increased openness observed du ring this process will keep 
inflation under control, particularly in the goods group.  
22. Another factor that has been closely monitored is c redit developments. Both 
on the consumer and corporation sides, credits have  displayed a relatively stable 
trend in the last period. A certain level of satura tion reached in automobile demand is 
considered to have contributed to this development.  Meanwhile, the high increases in 
housing credits are continuing. As a reflection of the economic normalization process, 
credit interest rates fell remarkably and maturitie s gradually started to be extended. 
These developments encouraged credit utilization. T herefore, there has been a 
significant increase in housing credits, especially  in 2005. The reduction of fiscal 
dominance and the belief that financial deepening a nd economic stability will 
continue has supported the supply side. As a result  of these developments, the share 
of housing credits in consumer credits, which was 1 4 percent at the beginning of 
2004, reached 41 percent as of October 2005 and exc eeded automobile and other 
credits. Housing credits are expected to continue t o increase in the upcoming period. 
At this point, the Central Bank continues to consid er the rapid credit extension as a  9development requiring careful observation due to th e risks that it may pose to both 
price stability and financial stability.  
23. On the cost side, there is a relatively stable tren d in the last period stemming 
from both the strong course of the New Turkish lira  and the slackening oil prices. On 
the wage side, limited nominal increases are observ ed in the last period and unit 
labor costs remain at their historically low level as a result of the continuation of the 
increases in productivity. The continuation of inve stments is predicted to support 
partial labor productivity in the upcoming period, as well.  
24. In conclusion, although the current conditions in s upply-demand and labor 
markets do not exert pressure on inflation, it is n ecessary to carefully monitor 
domestic demand and cost conditions for inflation t o be consistent with the 5-percent 
target set for 2006.  
25. There is no doubt that attributing high importance to inflation figures or 
demand developments of a single month may lead to f alse judgments. For this 
reason, most central banks publish their inflation reports on a quarterly basis. In the 
upcoming period where the Central Bank of the Repub lic of Turkey will adopt the 
inflation-targeting regime, the Bank will update it s detailed inflation analysis and 
predictions regarding inflation on a quarterly basi s, as well.  
Monetary Policy and Risks 
26. Crude oil prices, which had exerted pressure on inf lation in the last two years, 
are observed to contribute positively to the declin e in inflation in the recent period. 
Provided that the same trend continues in the mediu m-term, the concerns about the 
secondary effects are likely to ease. However, cons idering the unpredictable price 
movements in this sector, risk scenarios should sti ll be based according the 
developments in oil prices. In other words, oil pri ces continue to pose a risk to  
monetary policy today. There is no doubt that a fur ther decline in oil prices would 
directly affect the forward-looking attitude of the  Central Bank.  
27. Another main factor that might pose risk to the fut ure inflation trend is 
prospective changes in international liquidity cond itions and developments in global  10 risk perceptions against developing countries. In s uch a case, fluctuations in foreign 
exchange markets might emerge that could push infla tion up through costs; 
however, simultaneously, interest rates would go up  and lead to a decrease in 
demand, and inflation would again be under control in the medium-term. Obviously, 
if such risks are materialized, uninterrupted progr ess in structural reforms will 
become crucial to have these fluctuations temporary .  
28. Another risk pertaining to the 2006 inflation is th e high price increases in the 
services group. Annual inflation in this group has gradually decreased in the last one-
year period and converged to 12 percent level. Howe ver, this level is not yet enough 
for the Central Bank to abandon its cautious stance  about services inflation. Even the 
services prices index that excludes items sensitive  to oil prices cruises well above the 
general inflation trend. It is natural for services  group inflation to be over the general 
inflation trend in an economy where the increase in  productivity in tradable goods is 
high. However, currently, services group inflation is 6 percentage points higher than 
the inflation in the prices of goods and this fact still raises concerns about the 
possibility of attaining the 2006 target. Even if i t is projected that the rise in the 
prices of services would gradually slow down throug h 2006, the contribution of this 
group to the year end inflation is calculated to be  2.5 percentage points, which urges 
the Central Bank to continue its cautious stance.   
Conclusion 
29. In the light of the above evaluations that also tak e into account the views put 
forward at the Monetary Policy Committee meeting, d ated 8 December 2005, it has 
been decided to cut short-term interest rates appli ed at the CBRT Interbank Money 
Market and Istanbul Stock Exchange Repo-Reverse Rep o Market by 0.25 percentage 
points. In case there is no extraordinary developme nt in the last month of the year, 
it is expected that end-2005 inflation will remain under the targeted level. According 
to the medium-term forecasts of the Central Bank, w hich are based on the 
assumptions that oil prices in 2006 would remain sl ightly below the 2005 level, there 
would be no substantial change in international liq uidity conditions, fiscal policy 
would be conducted in line with the end-year target  and monetary policy would be  11 conducted prudently, end-2006 inflation would be cl ose to the targeted level of 5 
percent. It should be underlined here that the caut ious stance of monetary policy 
should be maintained in order to achieve the inflat ion target. In the light of currently 
available data, the short-term interest rates are l ess likely to move upward than to 
move downward or to remain stable in the medium ter m. However in the short term, 
the likelihood of the short-term interest rates to remain stable is gradually increasing 
compared to previous periods. It is not possible to  make a clear-cut statement about 
the future direction of this trend due to several f actors: the main trend of inflation is 
proceeding above the medium-term targets; the posit ive contribution of favorable 
demand conditions to the downward trend in inflatio n has become less significant 
compared to the last three years; the rigidity of s ervices prices inflation persists; the 
uncertainties about liquidity conditions and oil pr ices continue. In this context, it 
should be underlined that any new data and informat ion associated with the inflation 
outlook over the next period would urge Central Ban k to revise its stance about the 
future.
