THE CBRT PRESS RELEASE

As is known, the Central Bank of Turkey (CBRT) announced yesterday a series of
measures for Turkish lira and foreign exchange markets following the bombings occurred in
Istanbul.
Transactions done in the markets were completed smoothly yesterday, and payment
systems worked until the cut-off time (at 6 p.m.).
Despite the normalization observed in the markets today, the CBRT has decided to
continue implementing the yesterdayâ€™s measures also today as a precaution.
