The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to lower the policy
rates as follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate is decreased from 6.75 percent to
6.50 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 9.25 percent to 9 percent,
b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate between 4:00 p.m. –
5:00 p.m. is decreased from 2.75 percent to 2.50 percent, while lending rate is
decreased from 12.25 percent to 12 percent,
c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities
provided for primary dealers via repo transactions is decreased from 8.25
percent to 8 percent.
Recent data releases indicate that, in line with the Committee’s previous
assessments, the ongoing recovery in economic activity will be gradual and protracted.
External demand and domestic investment demand remain weak. Moreover,
consumption demand has displayed a weaker course, after having increased markedly
during the second quarter. Indicators on labor market suggest that it will take a long
time for the employment conditions to fully recover. Although headline annual inflation
could display some upward movements through mid-2010 due to strong base effects,
resource utilization, and hence inflation, is expected to hover around low levels.
Accordingly, the Committee has indicated that the monetary policy stance outlined in
the Inflation Report would be maintained.
The Committee notes that the cumulative policy rate cuts implemented since
November 2008 and the improvements in global risk perceptions have started to exert
favorable effects on credit markets. However, lingering problems across the global
economy are not resolved completely and there are still uncertainties regarding the
strength of the recovery. Taking these factors into account, the Committee has
reiterated that it would be necessary for the monetary policy to maintain an easing bias
for a long period of time. The Committee has also indicated that future rate decisions
would be conditional on economic data and developments.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation
outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within
eight working days.
