PRESS RELEASE ON DIRECT FOREIGN EXCHANGE INTERVENTION

In the CBRT policy document, the “Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for
2011”, issued on 21 December 2010, it was stated that “The Central Bank will
continue to take the necessary measures within its means and act prudently in order
to ensure the smooth functioning of the FX market and to support FX liquidity. Within
this framework, in case of unhealthy price formations due to a decrease in the depth
of the foreign exchange market, foreign exchange selling auctions may be resumed
under the basic principles of the floating exchange rate regime.
In addition, the Central Bank will continue to closely monitor exchange rate
developments as usual and will directly intervene in the market through purchase or
sale, in case of any unhealthy price formations in exchange rates due to speculative
behavior stemming from a decrease in market depth.
In view of the fact that financial stability is one of the prerequisites for price
stability, the Central Bank has always taken the necessary measures in order to
ensure the efficient functioning of Turkey’s foreign exchange market and will continue
to do so.”
At the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting of 4 August 2011, the Committee
agreed to closely monitor developments, and if necessary, take measures to provide
foreign exchange liquidity via the appropriate methods and instruments. Accordingly,
taking global developments into consideration, the Central Bank commenced
supplying FX liquidity to the market via high-volume foreign exchange selling
auctions as of 5 October 2011.
In this framework, the Central Bank may hold another high-volume foreign
exchange selling auction tomorrow.
Furthermore, as unhealthy price formations in exchange rates are being
observed due to speculative behavior stemming from a decrease in market depth, the
Central Bank is directly intervening in the market through sale.
