In the CBRT policy document, the “Monetary and Exch ange Rate Policy for 
2011”, issued on 21 December 2010, it was stated th at “The Central Bank will 
continue to take the necessary measures within its means and act prudently in order 
to ensure the smooth functioning of the FX market a nd to support FX liquidity. Within 
this framework, in case of unhealthy price formatio ns due to a decrease in the depth 
of the foreign exchange market, foreign exchange se lling auctions may be resumed 
under the basic principles of the floating exchange  rate regime. 
In addition, the Central Bank will continue to clos ely monitor exchange rate 
developments as usual and will directly intervene i n the market through purchase or 
sale, in case of any unhealthy price formations in exchange rates due to speculative 
behavior stemming from a decrease in market depth.  
In view of the fact that financial stability is one  of the prerequisites for price 
stability, the Central Bank has always taken the ne cessary measures in order to 
ensure the efficient functioning of Turkey’s foreig n exchange market and will continue 
to do so.” 
At the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting of 4 Augus t 2011, the Committee 
agreed to closely monitor developments, and if nece ssary, take measures to provide 
foreign exchange liquidity via the appropriate meth ods and instruments. Accordingly, 
taking global developments into consideration, the Central Bank commenced 
supplying FX liquidity to the market via high-volum e foreign exchange selling 
auctions as of 5 October 2011. 
In this framework, the Central Bank may hold anothe r high-volume foreign 
exchange selling auction tomorrow.  
Furthermore, as unhealthy price formations in excha nge rates are being 
observed due to speculative behavior stemming from a decrease in market depth, the 
Central Bank is directly intervening in the market through sale.
