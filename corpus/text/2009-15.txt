CBRT PRESS RELEASE ON THE AMENDMENT TO
APPLICATION GUIDELINES AND CONDITIONS OF
EXPORT REDISCOUNT OPERATIONS

The limit for the export rediscount credit to be extended by the
Central Bank to exporters is increased to USD 2.5 billion.
The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBT) had already made
public in its press release of 5 December 2008 that in order to mitigate the
adverse effects of the global financial turmoil on the corporate sector, the limit
for export rediscount credits was increased by USD 500 million to USD 1 billion
and the utilization of these credits was facilitated with an amendment to the
application guidelines and conditions for export rediscount credits.
As of 20 March 2009, in order to widen the use of export rediscount
credits and facilitate access to more firms, the pre-shipment financing facility
provided via Turkish Eximbank began to be extended, along with export
companies and manufacturer-export companies, also to manufacturing
companies that manufacture final products for export purposes and export them
via export companies, but do not qualify as an export company. Besides, the
credit limit of USD 10 million per company was raised to USD 40 million for
Foreign Trade Capital Companies.
These arrangements led to a sharp increase in the volume of export
rediscount credits extended via Turkish Eximbank. While the total credit
utilization was USD 1.7 million for 2008, it reached USD 502.5 million in the
period between 1 January and 16 April 2009. Having taken this development
into account, in order to make the utmost contribution to meeting the financing
needs of export companies, the export rediscount credit limit is raised by USD
1.5 billion to USD 2.5 billion. Besides, for firms other than Foreign Trade Capital
Companies, the credit limit that used to be USD 10 million per company is set
as USD 20 million.
