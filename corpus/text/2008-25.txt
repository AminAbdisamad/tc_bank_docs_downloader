THE CENTRAL BANK OF THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
PRESS RELEASE ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEPOSIT MARKET
As known, the Central Bank used to act as intermediary in various foreign
exchange transactions performed among authorized banks while it could also carry
out transactions in concordance with policy targets in the Foreign Exchange and
Banknotes Market established within the Bank in 1988. The foreign exchange deposit
market was one of the markets where the Central Bank executed its intermediary
functions. However, as explained under “V. Arrangements For The Operational
Framework Of Monetary And Foreign Exchange Policies” of the Bank’s Press
Release on “Monetary Policy and Exchange Rate Policy in 2002 and Prospective
Developments” dated January 2, 2002 and no. 2002-1, the role of the Bank in foreign
exchange markets was restructured in a way to conduct and communicate exchange
rate policies better to fulfill its primary objective of achieving and maintaining price
stability and borrowing limits for the transactions exclusively among banks were
phased out in 2002. The Central Bank’s gradual phasing out of its intermediary
functions in the Foreign Exchange and Banknotes Markets foreign exchange deposit
market that started in July 2002 was completed as of December 2, 2002.
The recent problems in global credit markets accompanied with concerns on
credibility of the global financial sector have led to liquidity crunch in money markets
of developed countries. The institutions in charge of eliminating the problems in these
markets and facilitating the smooth performance of the actions are the central banks
of the relevant countries. Currently, central banks are in an effort to eliminate the
shortage in their own money markets through liquidity operations. However, such an
atmosphere of uncertainty occasionally brings about a decline in the mobilization of
foreign exchange liquidity. Therefore, it has been decided that the Central Bank
should resume its activities as an intermediary in the foreign exchange deposit
markets in Foreign Exchange and Banknotes Markets as of today until the
uncertainties are eliminated in the international markets in a view to contributing to
the enhancement of the mobilization of foreign exchange liquidity in the Interbank
Foreign Exchange Market.

In this context, banks shall be able to borrow and lend in the foreign exchange
deposit market through the intermediation of the Central Bank in accordance with the
rules set by the Implementation Instructions for the Interbank Money Market.
