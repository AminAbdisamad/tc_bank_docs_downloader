PRESS RELEASE ON THE TECHNICALITIES OF MAINTAINING TURKISH LIRA
RESERVE REQUIREMENTS
Considering operational processes with respect to reserve requirements, some
technical amendments have been made to the Communiqué on Reserve Requirements
no. 2005/1. These amendments stipulate that, as is the case with FX reserve
requirements, the Turkish lira equivalent of FX reserves maintained for Turkish lira
reserve requirements will be calculated by using the exchange rates announced in the
Official Gazette on the calculation date; the US dollar reserves held with the Central
Bank to maintain for Turkish lira reserve requirements will not be less than 50 percent
of total FX reserves; and the carryover limit will be 5 percent.
The aforementioned amendments will be effective as of the calculation period
dated 17 August 2012, and the maintenance period will begin on 31 August 2012.
These amendments are not expected to have a significant impact on the banking
sector.
