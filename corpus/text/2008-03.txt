Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) is implementing a formal inflation-targeting 
regime since the beginning of 2006. Central Bank Law, as stipulated in the Article 
42, requires the CBT to be accountable for the non-ful fillment of inflation targets. To 
facilitate the accountability principle, the CBT has bee n disclosing a quarterly path 
for inflation with an uncertainty band. In this context , any breach of upper or lower 
limits of the band requires the CBT to write an open letter to the Government, 
explaining the reasons for the breach and the measures to  be taken to ensure that 
inflation rate will return to levels within pre-establ ished limits. 
Accordingly, end-year inflation target for 2007 was set  as 4 percent, with an 
uncertainty band of 2 percentage points on either side.  The annual Consumer Price 
Index (CPI) inflation outturn by the end of December 2007 was 8.39, breaching the 
upper limit of the uncertainty band (Figure 1). This open letter explains the reasons 
why inflation in 2007 exceeded the end-year target by  a large margin, evaluates the 
measures taken by the Central Bank of Turkey to bring in flation back to the target, 
and presents the medium term outlook. As mentioned in o ur policy statement titled 
“General Framework of Inflation Targeting and Moneta ry and Exchange Rate Policy” 
published in December 2005, this Open Letter will also be presented to the IMF as 
part of the program conditionality.

Reasons For Exceeding the Target 
The monetary tightening exercised since mid-2006 has been  successful in 
leading to a significant reduction in the underlying i nflation. The fall in headline 
inflation, however, was more limited, owing mainly to  factors beyond the control of 
monetary policy, such as developments in food, energy, an d administered prices. 
Both domestic and international developments have played  a part on the 
course of food prices. A prolonged shortage of rainfall in Turkey since Autumn 2006 
has resulted in low crop yields in 2007, which in turn t ranslated to an adverse supply 
shock. Global developments, such as increasing bio-fuel produ ction, strong global 
demand for food and consequent rises in agricultural comm odity prices, further 
added to the domestic food inflation through the exter nal trade channel. These 
factors had an impact not only on the prices of unprocessed food (such as fresh 
vegetables and fruit) but also on the prices of processed  food (such as grain and 
dairy products). Accordingly, annual food inflation mai ntained its high levels, with an 
end-year figure of 12 percent. Hence, food prices became  the main factor impeding 
the disinflation process in 2007, with a marked contribut ion of about 3.4 percent on 
headline inflation. Consequently, the contribution of  food prices to the headline 
inflation in 2007 was significantly higher than it had  been in the past three years 
(Figure 2).

Another major factor slowing the disinflation process was adverse 
developments in energy and administered prices. The crude  oil price in December 
2007 was nearly 50 percent above the levels registered at  the end of 2006. This 
development, together with the changes in special consumpt ion tax on fuel-oil 
products, led to a significant rise in the prices of fuel- oil products in 2007. Another 
energy item, housing water prices, which is administered by municipalities, edged up 
in the last quarter of 2007, partly owing to the dro ught conditions. Overall, 1.6 points 
of the headline inflation resulted from the energy p rice hikes, where the contribution                                                                                                            Central Bank of Turkey  
 3of administered component outweighs that of the oil pr ice. Moreover, the prices of 
tobacco products increased by about 18 percent in 2007, du e to adjustments in 
special consumption tax. In sum, the contribution of energ y and tobacco products to 
the headline annual inflation reached 2.4 percentage points at the end of 2007. 
A closer look at the last couple of years’ annual inflati on in certain subgroups of 
the CPI reveals the main factors behind the rise in infl ation in 2007. Figure 3 depicts 
the marked contribution of the hikes in food, energy an d tobacco prices. The fast 
pace of disinflation in services and core goods (goods excludi ng food, energy and 
tobacco) in 2007,confirms that supply side shocks were mainly  responsible for the 
breach of the uncertainty band.

Adding some international perspective may help to bette r evaluate the recent 
inflation dynamics. Lately, inflation has been rising a lmost all over the world (Figure 
4). Elevated prices of crude oil, agricultural products an d other commodities have 
continued to exert inflationary pressures. Although second  round effects have been 
so far limited–thanks to well-established credibility of monetary authorities all over 
the world, sustained increases in commodity prices have start ed to take their toll on 
headline inflation, if not on core inflation. Inflat ion in US and Euro area edged up in 
the last quarter of 2007 while emerging economies unde r inflation targeting have 
been facing an upward trend since June 2007. Figure 4 i llustrates that in 2007 
inflation in Turkey followed a more favorable trend co mpared to other emerging                                                                                                            Central Bank of Turkey

Measures Taken to Ensure the Convergence of Inflati on to the Targets  
Monetary policy affects inflation with a considerable la g. Therefore, in order to 
understand the recent inflation dynamics, it would be u seful to go back to the 
monetary policy implementation in 2006. The volatilit y in the financial markets in 
May-June 2006 period and the consequent deterioration in inflation expectations 
had compelled the CBT to react decisively by hiking policy  rates by a total of 425 
basis points in a relatively short period of time. This p olicy reaction was successful in 
containing inflation expectations. However, since inflatio n followed a relatively 
elevated course due to the lagged impact of exchange rate  pass-through, the gap 
between targets and inflation expectations remained at considerable levels. These 
factors, together with prevailing uncertainties over the impact of monetary policy and 
the risks pertaining to potential second round effects of a series of supply side 
shocks, necessitated a tight monetary policy for an extended  period. Accordingly, 
policy rates were kept on hold for the following 13 mo nths. 
Strong monetary tightening was effective in moderating  the private 
consumption demand (Figure 5). Although government spen ding accelerated and 
                                                
1 2007 primary budget surplus was lower than the ini tial projections, owing mainly to rising government  
expenditures. The government implemented a fiscal p ackage, through raising indirect taxes on tobacco a nd 
some fuel-oil products in November 2007, and increa sing the tariff rates on electricity and natural ga s in 
January 2008, to ensure the attainability of revenu e targets for 2008.                                                                                                               Central Bank of Turkey  
 5external demand remained strong in the following quar ters, monetary tightening was 
successful in curbing the aggregate demand, especially thro ugh the slowdown in 
durable goods, housing and other services activities. Starti ng from the year 2007, 
the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) signaled through the policy statements that 
measured rate cuts were envisaged sometime around the last  quarter of 2007.

A year after the monetary tightening, core inflation  indicators displayed a 
significant deceleration. The effects of the tightening were clearly visible on the 
prices of durable goods and services, consistent with the slow down in the economic 
activity of related sectors. The weaker demand, coupled wi th a strong domestic 
currency, helped durables inflation to come down signifi cantly. Services inflation also 
eased remarkably, declining by 3.6 percentage points thr oughout 2007. The 
improvement in services inflation spread across all sub-items.  Especially, the fall in 
rent inflation, the stickiest component of services inflatio n, was significant (Figure 6).

These developments set the ground for a relatively less re strictive monetary 
policy. Moreover, the turbulence in mature financial ma rkets in August increased the 
likelihood of sooner-than-envisaged slowdown in global e conomic activity, and thus Monetary Tightening                                                                                                            Central Bank of Turkey  
 6paved the way for initiating the policy rate cuts that was hinted earlier in the year. 
Accordingly, the MPC decided to start the measured rate cut cycle in September 
2007. Policy rates were lowered by 200 basis points since then (Table 2). The MPC 
underscored that monetary policy remained restrictive even  after these rate cuts, 
pointing to further room for easing. However, the MPC  also underlined the need to 
remain cautious against the risks related to potential seco nd round effects of food 
and energy prices, as manifested in the sticky inflation e xpectations.

Both the 12-month and the 24-month ahead inflation expectations exhibited a 
declining pattern throughout 2007 (Figure 7). However , the improvement in 
expectations, especially in the last quarter, was rather l imited, owing to a backward 
looking behavior, and possibly, due to pre-announced hike s in administered energy 
prices. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to mention that th e administrative price hikes in 
November had little effect on medium term expectations, despite the upward 
revision in the year-end inflation expectations. This obse rvation shows that inflation 
target, to a significant extent, continue to serve as an a nchor and that economic 
agents expect the disinflation process to continue in the m edium term. Nevertheless, 
the fact that currently medium term inflation expectati ons are significantly above our 
medium term target of 4 percent necessitates a cautious po licy stance. 2

Outlook For Inflation and Monetary Policy 
There are several reasons why inflation should decelerate  further in the 
forthcoming period: 
Annual percentage change in CPI excluding food, energy and tobacco items 
imply an inflation trend of 4.8 percent (Figure 8). 3 In other words, underlying inflation 
in the past year was not far away from the medium ter m targets. Therefore, under 
the assumption that oil and food inflation will follo w a more benign path in 2008 than 
in 2007, it is fair to expect some contribution to disinf lation from the base effects. 
 
 
Another factor likely to contribute to the disinflation  is a continuing output gap. 
Economic activity responded significantly to the strong mon etary tightening in mid-
2006. The sharp slowdown in the second half of 2006 crea ted an ample slack in the 
economy. Domestic demand showed some signs of recovery in th e second half of 
2007. Latest readings suggest that economic activity was mor e vigorous at the turn 
of the year than implied by the third quarter figur es; yet, the pace of the domestic 
demand was not enough to completely eliminate the out put gap. Accordingly, we 
estimate that current demand and capacity conditions conti nue to contribute to the 
disinflation process (Figure 9). The recent loosening in the labor market also 
supports this view. Unemployment in September-November p eriod has risen from 
9.3 percent in 2006 to 9.7 percent in 2007. Annual ra te of growth in non-farm 
employment in this period was only 1 percent, lowest val ue registered in the past 
two years. 
 
                                                
3 Official core inflation measures, published under the name “ Special CPI Aggregates”, do not exclude 
processed food prices. We believe that excluding th is item, in line with the international practice, c ould give a 
better proxy for recent inflation trends. Figure 8: Response of Inflation to the Monetary Tig htening

Tight monetary conditions continue to support the disinf lation process. Despite 
the recent rate cuts, monetary policy can still be consider ed to be in the restrictive 
territory. Underlying rate of monetary expansion rema ins modest, consistent with a 
relatively restrictive monetary stance. Although medium t erm interest rates followed 
a downward trend in the past quarter, 2-year real ra tes at this point fluctuate 
between 9 and 10 percent, implying a non-accommodative monetary stance. 
Moreover, the currency remains strong, curbing inflationa ry pressures and easing 
the impact of rising commodity prices on domestic productio n costs (Figure 10).  
Credit data also suggest that monetary conditions are sti ll non-accommodative. 
Annual growth rates in the automobile and housing loa ns are at much lower levels 
compared to the periods of vigorous domestic demand (Figu re11). Following the 
significant slowdown in the second half of 2006, consumer credits showed signs of 
recovery after the first quarter of 2007 (Table 3). Ho wever, cautious monetary policy 
stance and the tightening in global credit conditions ar e likely to restrain credit 
expansion in the forthcoming period.  Figure 9: Output Gap

External demand conditions are also expected to contribute  to disinflation in 
2008. Recent data on global activity suggest that world economic growth is likely to 
moderate in the forthcoming period. Difficulties relat ed to credit markets and 
subsequent concerns on financial stability have increased the  downside risks on 
global demand and hence on the pace of export growth. Although the reaction by 
central banks, in the form of liquidity injection and e asier monetary policy stance, 
has somewhat alleviated these concerns, they are not expecte d to be sufficient to 
engineer a rebound in economic activity anytime soon. 
The fiscal policy should also support disinflation in 2008 . Although, rising fiscal 
expenditures in 2007 partly offset the effects of moneta ry tightening, fiscal targets for 
2008 imply a relatively more restrictive policy. Taking t he government’s 
targets/projections as given, the contribution of fiscal exp enditures on aggregate 
demand is expected to decline in 2008. 
Overall, we expect aggregate demand conditions to support  the downward 
trend in the underlying inflation, i.e., inflation excluding items beyond the control of 
monetary policy such as energy, food and tobacco prices. He nce, barring new 
supply shocks, headline inflation should continue to move t owards the target. The 050 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450

 10 speed of the convergence to the target, however, will de pend mainly on the course 
of food and energy prices. 
Our forecast in the 2007 October Inflation Report incor porated two main 
assumptions: The assumption for oil price was set as 70 USD per barrel. Observing 
the high base created by the unusually elevated food pr ices in 2006, we assumed 
food inflation to correct towards the values consistent wit h medium term inflation in 
2007. However, food and energy inflation turned out to be more persistent than we 
had envisaged, as the prices of oil and agricultural commo dities continued to rise 
throughout 2007. These developments not only led to an  undershooting of our 
inflation projections for end-year 2007, but also necessi tated an upward revision in 
our medium term forecasts. 
 Accordingly, we revised our assumption for oil prices to 8 5 USD per barrel in 
2008. We have also revised up our projections for the foo d inflation. We now 
envisage that the lagged impacts of last year’s drought a nd elevated prices of 
agricultural commodities in global markets are likely to keep processed  food inflation 
at relatively high levels throughout 2008.  
Higher oil price assumption added about 0.5 percentage points to the end-
2008 inflation forecasts. Moreover, the first round impa ct of the recent hikes in end-
user electricity and natural gas prices is computed to be a round 0.6 percentage 
points, which is higher than we assumed in the previous In flation Report. These 
factors, together with the assumption of higher food in flation, largely explain the 
upward revision of the end-2008 inflation forecast, imp lying that it will take longer to 
bring headline inflation to 4 percent, than envisaged in our latest Inflation Report. 
Therefore, in the absence of a significant correction in food inflation, headline 
inflation will most probably exceed the target level of  4 percent at the end of 2008.  
Accordingly, we forecast inflation, with 70 percent prob ability, to be between 
4.1 percent and 6.9 percent (midpoint 5.5) at the end  of 2008, and between 1.8 
percent and 5.5 percent (midpoint 3.7) at the end of 2009 (Figure 12). The forecast 
is based on a scenario in which policy rates display a limi ted decline in 2008. Main 
message of the forecast is that continuation of the gradu al easing cycle that started 
in September 2007 will remain conditional on favorabl e data and developments. In 
that sense, the current policy stance envisages a more moder ate decline in policy 
interest rates than indicated in the previous Inflation Report. 4  
It should be emphasized that any new data or informat ion on the inflation 
outlook may lead to a revision in the policy stance. Ther efore, the policy path 
indicated above should not be perceived as a commitment on  behalf of the CBT.

There are both upside and downside risks to the inflatio n and monetary policy 
outlook: 
The main upside risk factor for the medium term inflati on outlook can be listed 
as potential second round effects of the accumulated supply  shocks, which may also 
create a higher than expected inflation inertia, as curr ently manifested in the medium 
term inflation expectations. So far, second round impacts of food prices have been 
limited and confined to selected sub-components of the ove rall index (such as 
restaurants and catering services). The potential second rou nd impact of elevated 
food and energy prices, however, should not be overlooked . Therefore, the CBT will 
keep a close eye on the price setting behavior along with  various core inflation 
measures. Our policy strategy will be to tolerate the f irst-round impact on inflation 
resulting from food, energy and one-off adjustments in  administered prices, while 
remaining responsive to the second round effects. 
Monetary policy remains attentive to developments in glo bal markets. The 
ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets continues to create uncertainty about 
the course of the global economy. Emerging markets have b een resilient up to this 
point. Our baseline scenario assumes a soft landing in deve loped economies, with 
no major portfolio shock on the Turkish financial markets. However, a sharper than 
expected slowdown could further dampen the global risk a ppetite, possibly having 
an adverse impact on inflation through a weakening in Y TL. While the possibility of a 
sharper-than envisaged slowdown in global economic activity , through its potential 
impact on the exchange rates, may constitute an upside risk  for the short term 
inflation outlook, it creates a downside risk for external  demand, and hence, for 
inflation in the medium term .                                                                                                            Central Bank of Turkey  
 12 It should be underlined that fiscal discipline of the pa st several years, by 
reducing the long-term risk premium, has been the key fo rce allowing the 
achievement of robust output growth during a remarkable  disinflation period. In that 
sense, we believe maintaining the prudent fiscal policy d uring an episode of 
worsening risk appetite is critical for preserving the resil ience of the economy.  
Our medium term projections are based on the assumption that government 
expenditure targets will be met in 2008. Moreover, we assume that any extra need 
to readjust the primary budget balance will be implem ented primarily through 
expenditure cuts rather than hikes in indirect taxes. There fore we envisage no major 
shocks arising from administered price adjustments, except the  hikes in electricity 
and natural gas in January 2008. Any deviation from th is framework may have an 
effect on the outlook for inflation and monetary poli cy. 
The recent increase in end-user energy prices may continue  to exert some 
temporary upward pressure on headline inflation in th e coming months. However, 
these adjustments will also support lower inflation in t he medium term as they 
contribute to a prudent fiscal stance and facilitate an e xpansion of the domestic 
energy production. Hence the central bank’s policy is not to react to these price 
adjustments, except to contain second-round effects. 
Developments in food prices are still considered as an impo rtant risk to the 
short-term inflation outlook, as food items constitute mo re than one fourth of the CPI 
basket. The course of food inflation is highly dependent  on domestic weather 
conditions as well as global developments. Although our b aseline scenario 
envisages a higher food inflation compared to the proje ctions in the previous 
Inflation Report, there is a significant chance of a dow nward correction in 
unprocessed  food inflation, especially given the base effect created  by the last two 
years’ elevated food prices. On the other hand, it is al so possible that global 
developments and increasing demand for certain food item s may further push up the 
food prices. Therefore, potential volatility in food p rices continues to pose risks to the 
inflation outlook on both sides. 
Conclusion 
Despite the persistently high food and energy inflatio n, monetary policy 
managed to control underlying inflation and inflatio n expectations in 2007. We 
expect inflation excluding energy, food and tobacco items to stay close to medium 
term inflation target of 4 percent in the forthcoming  period. Barring new supply 
shocks, the restrictive monetary conditions over the coming mo nths are expected to 
drive headline inflation towards the target. The speed  of the convergence, however, 
will largely depend on the course of food and energy prices. Although our highest 
priority is price stability, the CBT, in line with its medium term approach, will not 
react aggressively to the shocks beyond the control of monet ary policy, as doing so 
could create undesirable fluctuations in economic activity a nd distortions in relative 
prices. Therefore, in the case of persisting supply shocks, we  will tolerate inflation to 
exceed the target temporarily, while closely monitoring  the core indicators. This 
strategy will ensure hitting the target once the shocks fa de away.                                                                                                            Central Bank of Turkey  
 13 With the official inflation target being missed by a n oticeable margin in the past 
two years, managing expectations have become an issue of ut most importance. The 
CBT remains prepared to act preemptively so that risks to second-round effects of 
the rising energy and food prices do not materialize. Ongoing uncertainties in the 
global economy, hikes in electricity prices, and the risks to  price setting behavior 
compel the CBT to be attentive to the incoming informa tion. In this context, further 
monetary accommodation will depend on the factors affect ing medium term inflation 
outlook.  
So far, Turkish economy has been resilient to reappraisal  of risks in global 
financial markets. The support of fiscal policy and structur al reforms are critical in 
shielding the economy against possible further deteriora tion in global sentiment. In 
this respect, the European Union accession process and the im plementation of 
structural reforms envisaged in the economic program remai n to be important. 
Particularly, advances in structural reforms enhancing qual ity of fiscal discipline and 
raising productivity are monitored closely with regard t o their implications on 
macroeconomic and price stability.
