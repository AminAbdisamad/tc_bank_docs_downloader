3. The last six-month average of seasonally adjusted inflation was 1.22 percent in WPI and
0.92 percent in CPI. The average rates of increase correspond to 15.62 percent and 11.6
percent in annual terms. During the same period, the average rate of increase in seasonally
adjusted CPI excluding food became 0.87 percent. This figure corresponds to 11 percent in

annual terms (Figure 1İ).

Developments in Consumer Prices

4. Despite a relative slowdown in November, the price increases in food- beverages-tobacco
and clothing-shoes, which gained pace in October in line with the seasonal tendency,
continued to be a determining factor in CPI inflation. In November, price increases for these
two groups realized as 1.9 and 2.2 percent, respectively, thus remaining above CPI.
Meanwhile, private transportation vehicle prices, which rose by 7.1 percent due to
adjustments in special consumption tax, led to a 4.5 percent price increase in durable goods,
the highest level since July 2002. Another item in CPI goods group that displayed a relatively
high-rated increase is furniture and flooring prices, which rose by 1.4 percent. In this
context, the rate of increase in seasonally adjusted goods prices rose by 0.2 point compared

to October and realized as 0.6 percent.

5. Despite the boosting effect of price increases in the food and clothing subgroups on
inflation trend for the last two months, the eleven-month cumulative price increases in these
two groups realized as 5.7 and 1.8 percent respectively, remaining substantially below the
CPI increase of 8.8 percent in the same period. However, the prices of private transportation
vehicles, furniture and flooring increased guite above the inflation trend in the January
November period, realizing as 12.9 and 16.6 percent, respectively.

6. Meanwhile, seasonally adjusted price increases in services rose to 1İ.6 percent from 1.3
percent of October. This development mainliy stemmed from the realization of rent increase

as 1.4 percent, which is even above the November 2003 figure despite the removal of

unfavorable seasonal factors of the August-October period. Hence, rent increase resumedi its
upward trend in annual terms after a ten-month period and reached 1İ9./ percent.
Accordingiy, the annual price increase in services group rose by 0.3 points compared to
October, and reached 15.6 percent. As for the goods group, annual inflation dropped to 6./

percent from 6.9 percent in October (Figure 2).

7. Conseguently, price increases in seasonally adjusted CPI and CPI excluding food realized
0.2 point and 0.5 point higher than their average values of the first ten months of the year,
respectively. While annual CPI inflation declined to 9.79 percent, CPI inflation excluding food
prices rose to İ0.91 percent (Figure 3). The increases in food, transportation and rents

prices stood as the determinants of the rise in CPI inflation excluding food.

Developments in Wholesale Prices

8. 0.29 point of the 0.75 percent monthiy WPI inflation resulted from public sector price
increases and the remaining 0.46 percent from private sector. Seasonally adjusted WPI

inflation dropped by iİ./ points in November compared to October and became 0.7 percent.

9. Agricultural prices rose by 1.2 percent in November, whereas seasonalliy adjusted
agricultural price increase declined to 0.7 percent. Considering the increases in seasonally
adjusted agricultural prices by 3.6 percent and 2.8 percent in September and October,
respectively, it is clear that the agricultural price increase has significantly lost pace in
November. Meanwhile, WPI excluding agriculture increased by 0.6 percent. Hence, the

cumulative price increase in WPI excluding agriculture reached 14.1 percent since January.

10. In November, prices in public manufacturing industry upped by 0.9 percent. The said
upsurge was slight because of the 2.1 percent decline in prices of basic metal industry
sector. On the other hand, prices in petroleum products industry, which contributed highiy to
public manufacturing industry inflation in October, persisted to exert an upward pressure on

public manufacturing industry prices with an increase by 1.8 percent in November as well.

11. Private manufacturing industry prices boosted by 0.2 percent. This increase mainly
stemmed from the depreciation of US dollar by 3.5 percent in the October-November period

and sluggish upward trend in price increases in public manufacturing industry. Meanwhile,

clothing manufacturing prices fell by 9.4 percent in November, after having soared by 14.1

12. Energy prices within the WPI group maintained their current trend and rose by 0./

percent. On annual basis, however, energy prices contracted by 0./ percent in November.

13. — In November, annual inflation rates in WPI and WPI excluding agriculture fell
to 14.40 percent and 14.96 percent, respectively. Annual price increases in public
and private manufacturing industries differed mainiy due to volatile international
goods prices. Annual price increases in public and private manufacturing industries

realized as 25.16 percent and 11.39 percent, respetctively.
II. COUTLOOK

14. Consumer prices inflation, which was recorded as 68.5b percent at the end of 2001,
dropped to single digits by May 2004 and generally maintained this trend in the second half
of the year. Undoubtediy, main factors paving the way for this achievement were the tight
fiscal and monetary policies implemented in coherence with each other and a series of
structural reforms initiated with the introduction of the program. By the last month of this
year, there is no doubt on the attainability of 2004 inflation target and the attention has
been directed towards the end-year target for 2005. Having foreseen all these developments
beforehand, the Central Bank has already been drawing attention to risks to the inflation
target for the next year since March 2004. Meanwhile, the pause being observed recentiy in
the downward trend of annual inflation figures are arising guestions whether the downward
trend of inflation in the last three years would continue in 2005 as well. At this point, it
would be helpful to adopt a forward-looking approach in interpreting the general

macroeconomic outlook and the information provided by sub-items of inflation.

Inflation: Sub-Items

15. Following high price increases than expected in October, the interpretation of November
inflation figures gains special importance. When seasonally adjusted, the relative increase in
food prices seems to be temporary. This supports the findings in our “October inflation and
outlook” report. Meanwhile, the shift of seasonality in clothing group to October—November,
instead of September-October caused an illusion as if prices increased relatively. When doing
the analysis, it should be considered that price increase in clothing sector was only 1.8

percent in the first 11 months of the year.

16. In the first İİ months of 2004, the cumulative increase in prices was recorded as 8.8
percent. Especially rent (17.60), prices of transportation (15.80), and furniture-flooring
(16.600) sectors rose remarkabiy. The contribution of these sub-items to İİ-month price
increases İs 4.75 points. Whether the negative impacts of price developments in the
mentioned sectors could continue is crucial for the 2005 inflation. Due to the signs of revival
in domestic demand and propensity to compensate relative prices that have remained İlow, it
is thought that high increases in rents and furniture prices may continue in 2005 as well. On
the other hand, under the presumption that in 2005, there would not be a need to increase

the taxes of vehicles as much as this year, and the surge in oil prices would not continue,
adverse effects of transportation group prices could be removed. Therefore, in 2005, the
main sub-groups that may pose risk in terms of inflation are predicted to be furniture
flooring and rent groups.

17. In terms of WPI, November 2004 has been a beneficial period. Agriculture prices, after
two consecutive months of extreme upsurges, turned back to its normal tendency. On the
other hand, the slowdown of price increases in private manufacturing industry has been a
favorable development for the future inflation period. However, the differentiation of

wholesale prices between public and private sector evidentiy continued in November.

18. At this point, it will be useful to put a special emphasis on the general public sector
pricing policy. In the 2005 budget, serious hikes are expected in special consumption taxes,
which form the bulk of tax revenues. Nevertheless, should the growth rate realize below the
expectations in 2005, total tax revenues might stay below the foreseen amount and
additional budgetary measures might become necessary. Iİn such a case, even if the oll
prices and exchange rate developments could pull down the refinery prices, petroleum prices
would not decrease; would even increase. Also, further price adjustments in other goods
produced by public can be expected. Such a situation would both deteriorate the relative
price structure, disrupting the efficient allocation of resources and challenge the fight against
inflation. To avoid similar potential adversities, it appears as a significant fact that the rise in
prices of goods and services produced by the public sector should not be perceived as the
most important determinant of “Tiscal discipline” in state economic enterprises, but the

deepening of fiscal adjustment via enhancing productivity in public sector instead.
General Macroeconomic Outlook

19. The main issue that marked the first three guarters of 2004 has been high growth rate
and the resulting current account deficit. However, in the second half of the year as a result
of the periodic impacts created by the deferred demand, it is observed that the rate of
acceleration in durable goods slowed down and the capacity utilization ratios decreased in
the mentioned sector owing to some temporary measures taken and the rise in interest rates
of consumer credits. Moreover, a slow-down is being observed in industrial production,
imports of intermediary goods, money demand and credits, excess İiguidity is declining,
consumer tendency and consumer confidence indices are becoming stable. Therefore, all
these developments and other leading indicators of economic activity point out to a
downward trend of growth in the third guarter of 2004 and that this relative deceleration

would continue in the last guarter as well.
20. Due to the tight fiscal and monetary polices implemented in the recent years, there is a
controlled recovery in domestic demand, which has not yet exerted an obvious pressure on
prices. As of the second guarter of 2004, since the recovery in demand for durable goods
has spread to wider sub-groups, the supply and demand edguilibrium in 2005 should give less
support to İnflation compared to the previous years. Besides, while going through an
unfavorable period in terms of raw material prices, keeping the domestic demand under
control is of specific importance for holding the inflation expectations at a low profile. To this

end, domestic demand indicators will continue to be closely monitored.

21. It is projected that investment intentions, which have maintained their high level for the
last four guarters, would make a positive impact on production and productivity in the
upcoming period. Moreover, provided that the fiscal discipline is upheld and the perceptions
that its guality would be enhanced become more widespread, real interest rates would
further decline, manufacturer confidence would be fostered, recovery in investments and
exports would continue, which altogether would be translated into growth resting upon a
more solid ground. Thus, rise in productivity would proceed, stable growth and decline in
inflatıon would be maintained simultaneousiy and favorable course of expectations would
support inflation. Evidentiy, all these projections are based on the assumption that the
current economic policy is maintained with a similar approach and the structural reforms that

have been already started are deepened.
Inflation and Risks in the Upcoming Term

22. 1n our recent repots as well as press releases, it was emphasized on the “base effect“
that has emerged as a result of the guite favorable course of cost conditions observed since
April 2003. We have reiterated that annual inflation figures are completely backward-looking
variables and they are determined by the past term's movements rather than the upcoming
term. Actually, annual inflation started to cliimb in July due to the base year effect and
returned back to the downward trend in autumn as part of this effect had ceased. At this
point, it is expected that a similar trend could probabiy be observed in 2005 as well. Increase
in prices in the first four months of the year remained subdued due to favorable demand
conditions as well as public pricing policy. However, as cost conditions turned unfavorable
and budget measures called for some unforeseen price adjustments, rise in prices
accelerated relatively as of May. Owing to the mentioned effect, an interruption and even a
spurt might be observed in the downward trend in inflation in the first four months of 2005.
However, it is anticipated that annual inflation calculated by using the current CPI would

head downwards again in May and would reach a level very close to the targeted level by
the end of the year. Evidentiy, these projections are made within the scope of the main
scenario in which the current economy policies are maintained with a similar approach, the
structural reforms are implemented steadfastly and there emerges no extraordinary situation
domestically or externally. We can summarize the risks that could lead to deviations from our

projections as follows:

23. A negative answer, worse-than-expected, pertaining to launching of accession process
intended for full membership in the European Union could increase risk perceptions and
create fluctuations in financial markets in return. Meanwhile, even if abrupt capital outflow
from developing countries seems to be a minor possibility for the time being, any changes in
global risk perceptions are accepted as factors that can pose risk to the stability of financial
markets. However, it should be once more reiterated that provided the structural reforms are
carried out without interruption and fiscal discipline is maintained, the effects of exogenous
factors would be limited. In fact, studies are underway for drawing up a new National
Economic Program to be implemented in the next three years and perceptions have
increased that fiscal and monetary discipline as well as structural reforms would be the core
of the new program. As social security reform, tax reform and public governance reform
would make a positive impact on productivity in public sector and enhance duality and
sustainability of fiscal discipline, they would very much contribute to fostering the

fundamentals of economy.

24. Another significant risk factor for 2005 inflation is the likelihood that the differentiation
between the goods and services prices might go beyond the predicted limits. Under normal
conditions, part of price differentiations between goods and services can be attributed to the
facts that; backward-indexation mechanism is guite strong in the services sector, increases
in competitiveness and productivity in the sectors subject to foreign trade are in place, and
pass-through effect from the exchange rate to domestic consumer prices is felt more
strongly in the goods group. However, the annual rent increases at around 20 percent are
becoming a phenomenon that is guite remarkable and difficult to explain, especially at a time
when we are entering into a period in which the year-end target will be 8 percent. To give
an example, if this trend continues in the next period, the rate of increase in rents could

likely account for 40 percent of the 2005 inflation figure.

25. The high rate of increase observed in productivity in recent years will undoubtediy
provide an impetus to demand for labor force, create new job opportunities later on and lead
to a rise in real wages. However, in case where a wage policy focusing on the inflation target

İs carried on in public sector, private sector İs expected to adopt a similar behavior in the
short term and the upsurge in unit labor costs will be limited. Meanwhile, achievement of
full Macroeconomic stability, removal of bureaucratic barriers against investment and
production and enhancement of a competition environment are of critical importance in

order for the hike in labor productivity to be permanent in the medium term.

26. Direct effects of the escalating prices of raw material imports on price indices have been
recently observed in WPI particulariy. In the event that these developments evidentiy follow
an unfavorable course or become more serious, incidence of the hikes in wholesale prices on
inflation will be effective in 2005. Although there is no current data that point out to an
upturn in medium term-inflation driven by the said developments, close follow-up of the
indirect effects of cost pressures on İnflation expectations and pricing behavior in the next

period is of critical importance.

27. Moreover, the effects of food and agricultural prices on the inflation target are always
unpredictable. In December, food prices are expected to support the inflation. However, the
favorable course of food prices in overall 2004 does not give clear signals of the continuation
of this trend in 2005. The point that should be underlined here is that the monetary policy
will act along with the medium and long term-inflation tendencies determined by economic

fundamentals rather than temporary shocks in the short term.

28. To conclude, it is clear that inflation will realize in accordance with the end-year inflation
target for 2004. In the light of the evaluations above, it is predicted that inflation will

continue to fall down despite small periodic fluctuations.

29. Another important factor concerning the inflation figures in the upcoming period is the
announcement of inflation figures by SIS in terms of updated baskets as of February 2005.
The medium and long term-inflation trends, which will be calculated by using the new
basket, are expected to bear similarities to those calculated by using the former basket İit is
probable that two series may also differentiate from each other. It should be underlined here
that new price series will be effective in monetary policy decisions and the Central Bank will
continue to focus on CPI. The word “inflation” will refer to the increase in CPİ, as always and
developments in producer prices will be evaluated according to the hikes in consumer prices
in the upcoming period, in other words; in terms of the information about the future

inflation.
