PRESS RELEASE  
ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE INTERVENTION  
OF THE CENTRAL BANK  
  
The Central Bank has announced in several press releases that under the floating 
exchange rate regime, the level of exchange rate is determined by supply and demand 
conditions of the currency markets, the volatility of the exchange rate is being closely 
monitored by the Central Bank, and it may directly intervene in the markets in the event 
of excessive volatility that might occur in either direction.  
Recently, excessive volatility has been observed in exchange rates due to the 
increased supply of foreign exchange. Therefore, in order to prevent fluctuations in 
exchange rates, the Cent ral Bank has today  directly intervened in the markets by buying 
foreign currency. As was also the case with previous intervention to buy or sell, todayâ€™s 
intervention should not be interpreted as if the Central Bank were uneasy at the actual 
level of the T urkish lira.
