3. The last six-month average of seasonalliy adjusted inflation was 1.23 percent in WPI and 0.93 in
CPI. The average rates of increase correspond to 15.8 percent and İİ./ percent in annual terms.
During the same period, the average rate of increase in seasonally adjusted CPI excluding food

became 0.84 percent. This figure corresponds to 10.6 percent in annual terms (Figure İ).

Developments in Consumer Prices

4. Increase in food and clothing prices that were guite below the seasonal tendency in September
2004, gained pace in October 2004 and became a driving factor in CPI inflation. While the prices of
food, beverages and tobacco increased by 3.0 in October due to the starting of Ramadan, prices of
clothing and shoes rose by 5.7 percent. The decline of seasonally adjusted food, beverages and
tobacco prices to 0.2 percent and clothing-shoes prices to —İ.İ percent indicates that there is no
significant increase beyond seasonal factors in the prices of these sub-groups. Moreover, in the
January-October period, the rate of cumulative price increase, which was realized as 3./ percent in
food group and —0.4 percent in clothing-shoes group - guite below the 7.2 percent cumulative price
increase in CPI in the same period - points at a consistent increase with the general tendency toward

inflation.

5. Apart from food and clothing groups, the largest contribution to the October CPI inflation came
from the sub-items of house and transportation. In October 2004, rents, which constitute the bulk of
house group, rose by 1.7 percent and hence, cumulative increase in rents in 2004 reached 15.9 as of
October. The increases in rents that have accelerated in August-October period due to freguent
renewal of lease agreements are expected to slow down relatively in the rest of the year. However, İt

is inevitable that the increase in rents will be realized guite above CPI inflation at the end of the year.
6. Owing to the 5 percent increases made in prices of petroleum, prices of transportation group twice

(in early October and in mid-October), transportation prices rose by 3.7 percent, thus contributing to

October CPI inflation by 0.3 points. With the recent price increases, petroleum prices under CPI

increased by about 27 percent during the January-October period.

7. In the meantime, the acceleration of price increases in goods group in October in connection with

the food and clothing groups, led to relative narrowing of the gap between annual rates of increase in

the groups of goods and services (Figure 2). The annual rate of increase in services group remained

the same at 15.3 percent in October, while rising to 6.9 percent from 5.6 percent in the group of

goods. Yet, the narrowing gap between the price increases in goods and services groups is considered

to be a positive development, to the extent that the services prices get closer to goods prices, and not

the other way around. By October, the seasonally adjusted cumulative increase is 5.3 percent for

goods group and İ1i./ percent for services group.

8. Hence, seasonally adjusted CPI and CPI excluding food prices rose by 0.1 percent and 0.3 percent

in October, respectively, compared to the average values recorded in the first nine months of the

year. Moreover, annual CPI inflation rose to 9.9 percent and CPI inflation excluding food prices to 10.4

percent in (Figure 3). The rise in annual inflation chiefly stemmed from the intensifying of unfavorable

seasonal factors of the September-October period mainiy in October. In other words, the October

2004 increase realized higher compared to October 2003, the period during which the seasonal effects

were more evenily shared between the two months. The shift in the seasonal factors affecting food

and clothing groups stood as the determinant factor in the rise of annual inflation in October.

Developments in the Wholesale Prices

9. The 0.94 points of the 3.23 percent-monthiy WPI inflation in October resulted from public sector
price increases and the remaining 2.29 points from private sector. Seasonally adjusted WPI increase
rose by 1.3 points in October compared to the average value of the first nine months, and realized as

2.4 points.

10. Agricultural sector and the public manufacturing sector were the driving factors of the outstanding
increase in wholesale prices. Having risen by 6.1İ percent in October following the 5.5 percent increase
in September, agricultural prices contributed by 1.4 points to October WPI inflation. Seasonally
adjusted agricultural price increase, which realized as 0.6 percent on average during the January
August period, rose to 3.2 percent in the September-October period.

11. In October, price increase in public manufacturing industry became 4.8 percent and reached its
highest level since December 2002. The largest contribution to the 4.8 percent-price increase in public
manufacturing industry came from petroleum products manufacturing prices, which increased by 8.İ
percent due to the 10 percent-increase in petroleum products. Thus, excluding petroleum products,
price increase in public manufacturing industry declined by i1i.4 percent. The sub-items that displayed
the highest price increase excluding petroleum products are chemical products and basic metal

industry manufacturing sectors with the 6.2 and 2./ percent-increases, respectively.

12.I1n October, the major contribution to the 1.4 percent-price increase in private manufacturing
industry came from the 14.1 and 3.6 percent-price increases in clothing manufacturing industry and
petroleum products, respectively. In October, clothing prices under CPI pursued an upward course
owing to seasonal factors, while the seasonally adjusted 10.6 percent increase in clothing

manufacturing prices indicates the effect of the factors other than seasonal factors. Clothing

manufacturing prices gained pace due to the rise in unit labor costs resulting from the increases in
real wages, which started at the end of 2002 and became more evident especially in the first guarter
of 2004.

13. Meanwhile, energy prices maintained their current trend and rose by 0.3 percent. Energy prices

displayed a decline by 1.2 percent on annual basis.

14. In October, annual WPI and WPI inflations excluding agriculture rose to 15.5 percent and 15.2
percent, respectively (Figure 4). Price increases in public and private manufacturing industries differ
mainliy due to the petroleum products manufacturing sector. Annual price increases in private and

public manufacturing industries became 12.2 and 24.4 percent, respetctively.

IT. OUTLOOK

15. To evaluate the inflation trend in the upcoming period, two kinds of analyses come to the
forefront: (i) The information provided by developments in the sub-items of prices with regard to the
future inflation; (il) General outlook of macro economy and inflation. To this end, we must first assess
the information provided by price developments in October and then evaluate the macroeconomic

factors and risks that could be important in terms of inflation dynamics in the next period.

16. In October, no obvious inflationary pressure was observed in the sub-items of CPI excluding food,
clothing and transportation. According to a recent research, the revival observed in food prices every
year in Ramadan is compensated in the successive months. In October 2004, the contribution of
Ramadan to the general CPI index became 0.3 polints. Meanwhile, it is noteworthy that despite the
boost in October, the prices in clothing sector remained at the same level compared to last year. In
other words, excluding seasonal factors, no obvious price acceleration was observed in the clothing
sub-group. The price increases in the transportation group are mostly arising from cost pressures
such as petroleum products, which is an exogenous factor having temporary effects on İnflation.
Hence, October inflation figures confirm that there has not been a marked pressure on consumer

prices yet.

17. While analyzing the information contained in the inflation figures of October with respect to the
future inflation, it is necessary to spare a separate paragraph for the prices of public sector goods.
Price increases in imported raw materlals since the turn of 2004 made price adjustments inevitable
especially in energy sector whose prices are determined by the public sector. Actualiy, some price
adjustments in fuel and other energy prices have recentliy come to the agenda and some of these
adjustments were made in October. It should be underlined that energy sector prices are reflected as
input cost İn many sectors and therefore deserve utmost care from inflationary point of view.
Therefore, while making price adjustments, it would be wise to take into account not only the direct
effect, but also the indirect effects generated by input costs and expectations, since the impact of
price increases in energy sector on inflation is non-linear. In other words, price adjustments made in
time when conditions are ripe have differing impacts on expectations than those adjustments that are
delayed even if conditions were ripe, and that are made later on a less freguent basis but at higher
rates. Therefore, reflecting the rises in imported oil and natural gas prices on the fuel and natural gas
products prices in a very short period toward the end of the year has iİncreased the risks stemming
from indirect impacts with regard to next year's inflation. İf most of these price increments were done
parallel to the rise in oil and natural gas prices without delay, the indirect impact of these increments
would be confined to 2004. By this way, an important risk for 2005 inflation target would be
eliminated, and the budget revenues would be realized higher by avoiding some of special
consumption tax İosses. Here it should be borne in mind that the downward trend in inflation will

continue, provided that the current program is implemented as stipulated before, and that even if
some short-term deviations might occur due to the impacts of exogenous factors on costs, these

deviations will be temporary, which can easily be explained to the general public.

18. Despite all these, even if the direct cost-push effects have been felt in the last few months, the
so-called “secondary” or “indirect” effects have not emerged yet, which can deemed to be a positive
development. When the sub-items of consumer prices are analyzed, it is observed that there are no
apparent deviations from the general inflation trend and furthermore, a certain degree of slow-down
is observed in most of the services group prices. Conseguentiy, in the light of the price data pertaining

to sub-items, it is not possible to deduce that there is an upward trend in general inflation in October.

19. The prospective developments and other risks that can affect inflation in the upcoming period are

as follows:

e “The domestic demand indicators reveal that recovery is not confined to consumer durables
anymore and has spread to other sectors as well, and spending on semi-durable and non-durable
goods along with other services has been accelerating. However, as most part of the postponed
demand has been met and some temporary measures have been taken in the second half of the year,
the rate of acceleration in domestic demand is expected to slow down. The slowdown in credit volume
and currency demand are factors supporting this assumption. But still, it is predicted that the
slowdown will be steady, and high output levels will be preserved with the support of foreign demand
that is believed to retain its strong position and with consumer confidence. Although it is estimated
that the output level would not exert an evident pressure on inflation by the end of 2004, monitoring

demand developments will become even more important in the upcoming period.

e — Rise in productivity and higher course of machinery-eguipment investments are persisting.
These developments are increasing the potential production level and help contain the pressure on
prices despite high capacity utilization ratios and relative recovery in domestic demand. However, rise
in productivity and high capacity utilization ratios will inevitably create new business opportunitles,
increase labor demand and lead to rise in real wages in general economy. Therefore, holding onto a
public wage and incomes policy that is consistent with the inflation target is critical to ensure that
disinflation is continued. Last three years' experience show that adopting a budget policy that is
consistent with the targets was one of the primary factors that has helped the inflation target to be
regarded as credible. Meanwhile, the upward trend in productivity will continue in the medium and the
long run provided that the obstacles to investments and production are wiped away, productivity in

public sector is increased and competition environment is improved.

e — Another main factor in terms of the inflation in 2005 is exogenous developments. The Federal
Reserve Bank has implied that it would not act abruptly in its interest-rate policy and would not be
aggressive in raising interest rates. Thus a sudden capital flight from developing countries seems very
unlikely for the time being. Certainly, sudden changes in global risk perceptions can always be
precarious for stability in financial markets. Moreover, in the process of adaptation to the EU, any

piece of information not in line with the expectations may increase risk perceptions in the markets and
may cause volatility. However, what needs to be emphasized once again is that if structural reforms
are carried out strictly and fiscal discipline is sustained, unfavorable exogenous developments will only

be temporary diversions from the main tendency.

e — Although declining a bit, the persistence of price rigidity in services sector poses a risk for
future inflation. Backward pricing behavior particularliy in such services group sub-items as education,
hospital services and rents are slowing the downward trend in inflation. By October 2004, goods
prices and services prices increased by 6.9 percent and İ5.3 percent, respectively. The fact that the
pass-through from exchange rates to prices were faster in goods group and the backward indexation
was higher in services group, as well as the increase in competitiveness and productivity in sectors
related to foreign trade have determined the said differentiation. That the services prices increase
more rapidiy compared to goods prices is a worldwide phenomenon, which can be explained partially
with structural factors. However, the risk posed by this phenomenon in countries where inflation is in
a downward trend is much higher. Moreover, it is difficult to explain with structural factors the reason
why the rents increased by 19.4 percent annualliy as of October, while the end-year inflation target
Wwas 12 percent for 2004. Although it is estimated that the said differentiation in price increases in the
upcoming period would decline compared to 2004, it is expected that the rises in goods prices would
remain below the rises in services group in the medium and long-term, and the rigidity in prices of

services group would slow the downward trend in inflation.

e Iİt İs anticipated that one of the most determining factors in 2005 inflation would be the
course of international raw material prices. At a time when single-digit inflation is targeted, the impact
of relative price changes caused by exogenous shocks will be more critical. The upward trend in crude
oil and basic metal prices in international markets has been continuing for a long time and the
likelihood of a reversal in this trend seems rather low in the short run, which pose an important risk
for 2005 inflation altogether. Although the direct effects of the persistentiy high levels of crude oil and
basic metal import prices on inflation have been felt for a while, these effects were more severe in
October due to the above-mentioned public-sector pricing policy. Though not exerting an obvious
pressure on general inflation trend in the light of today's data, the indirect effects of the said cost
rises on İnflation expectations and pricing behaviors in the upcoming period must be monitored

closely.

e — The course of agriculture and food prices in 2005 is estimated to be one of the determining
factors İn attaining the inflation target. As mentioned above, the coincidence of October with
Ramadan has affected the food prices unfavorabiy. This effect will probabiy be offset in the following
months. However, it should be kept in mind that the course of fresh vegetable and fruit prices under
the food item is mainly shaped by supply factors like natural conditions and the monetary policy has
only a limited effect on food prices. Therefore, the favorable course of food prices throughout 2004

contains little information about 2005 inflation.
20. The incidence of the rapid rises in wholesale prices on CPI in the upcoming period will be a
determining factor for 2005 inflation. The control of domestic demand and the developments about
expectations management will be the critical factors in this issue. In such a period, it is much more
important that the structural adjustments foreseen in the three-year national program are immediately
enforced, budgetary discipline is preserved without compromise and the guality of fiscal discipline is
enhanced. Especially the data pertaining to October once more manifest the importance of structural
reforms in disinflation efforts intended for enhancing the guality of fiscal discipline. While a
transformation is being observed on the inflation front, unprecedented for the last thirty years, İit
appears as a significant fact that the most important determinant of “fTiscal discipline” in state
economic enterprises is not the rise in prices of goods and services produced by the public-sector, but

the deepening of fiscal adjustment via enhancing productivity in public sector instead.

21. In conclusion, there is no factor that could jeopardize the attainability of the inflation target for
2004. Ünder the assumption that tight fiscal policies are sustained and a program that would further
deepen the structural reforms is implemented in the upcoming period, İit is anticipated that the
expectations will not deteriorate and the domestic demand will boost in a controlled manner. Thus, it
is foreseen that the main downward trend in inflation will continue, despite expected İittle fluctuations
from time to time. It should be kept in mind that the prices that bear significance in terms of a
monetary policy focusing on future inflation will be the prices determined by macroeconomic

fundamentals rather than those affected by short-term shocks.
