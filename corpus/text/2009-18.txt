SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: May 14, 2009
Inflation Developments
1. Consumer prices increased by 0.02 percent in April, while inflation fell to 6.13
percent year-on-year. Annual inflation was down month-on-month across all
major categories, suggesting a more broad-based deceleration in inflation
owing to the significant slowdown in economic activity.
2. Unprocessed food prices were down 0.95 percent in April because of declining
fruit and vegetable prices. Yet, annual inflation in this category rose month-onmonth, albeit modestly, to 10.87 percent in April. Foreign demand for fruits and
vegetables has been relatively increasing since the final quarter of 2008. In
fact, the quantity of exported fruits and vegetables grew by an average of 25.2
percent in the first quarter as compared to a year earlier, which partially offset
the downward pressure on their prices owing to increased production. On the
other hand, annual processed food inflation decreased further to 4.99 percent.
As a result, annual food and nonalcoholic beverages inflation dropped to 7.70
percent.
3. Energy prices decreased by 1.42 percent in April amid reduced electricity
tariffs and falling bottled gas, solid fuel and fuel prices. Accordingly, the rate of
increase in energy prices fell to 9.31 percent year-on-year. The reduction in
gas tariffs should help further slow the rate of increase in energy prices and
thereby is expected to push consumer inflation down by 0.3 percentage points
in May. Given the current level of oil prices, the yearly rate of increase in
energy prices could continue to slide in coming months.
4. Annual inflation in prices of goods excluding energy and food dropped by 2.17

percentage points in April to 2.06 percent, largely due to prices of durable
goods (excluding gold) which fell by 4.43 percent on the back of Special
Consumption Tax (SCT) and Value-Added Tax (VAT) cuts. The effects of the
tax cuts were most pronounced during March and April. Across the subcategories, the prices of furniture, automobiles and white goods fell by 7.63, 5
and 2.74 percent, respectively. Accordingly, inflation in durable goods plunged
to –5.96 percent year-on-year. However, it must be emphasized again that
these tax cuts would only have a short-lived favorable effect on inflation as
they are due to expire in the following months.

5. Services prices continue to fall amid the sharp contraction in domestic demand
and also because of the lagged effects of weakening cost pressures. The
yearly rate of increase in services prices slumped to a historic low of 7.61
percent in April. The decline was evident across all subcategories of services.
Annual services inflation is expected to edge further down in coming months.
6. Core inflation measures continue to trend downward, largely owing to the tax
cuts that have been in place over the past two months. Put differently, the
recent sharp declines in the core inflation measures have been primarily
driven by the tax cuts, and therefore the rapid slowdown in these measures is
expected to be temporary. However, even without the contribution of these tax
cuts, core inflation measures still declined, supporting the view that inflation is
still continuing on a downward path.
7. Overall, the Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) expects inflation to
decelerate further in the short run due to the softening in economic activity and
the past declines in oil and other commodity prices.
Factors Affecting Inflation
8. The latest data for the first quarter of 2009 confirmed the continuing sharp
contraction in economic activity. Industrial production shrunk by 22 percent
year-on-year in this period and declined at a faster pace than in the fourth
quarter of 2008 in seasonally adjusted terms.
9. Similarly, domestic investment demand contracted dramatically during the first
quarter of the year. In seasonally adjusted terms, production and imports of
investment goods and sales of heavy commercial vehicles fell sharply quarteron-quarter. In view of the low levels of resource utilization, and against the
backdrop of the ongoing uncertainty regarding the global economy, the
Committee expects investment demand to remain weak for quite some time.
10. Recent data releases indicate that there may be some rebound in private
consumer demand. The tax cuts that have been implemented as part of the
fiscal package to help stimulate the economy have accelerated the depletion
of inventories since March. In April, the tax cuts had a partial effect on the
production of transport vehicles and machinery and equipment, which account
for a significant share of the manufacturing industry. In fact, domestic sales of
automobiles were much stronger in April than their first-quarter average in
seasonally adjusted terms. Moreover, consumer confidence indices have also
gained some ground. Yet, the Committee members noted that some of the
rebound in domestic demand could be attributed to the price incentives
created by the fiscal package that brought consumer demand for selected

goods forward, and therefore, the pace and scale of the recovery in domestic
demand remains to be seen.
11. The private sector’s capacity utilization rate rose month-on-month in April for
the first time in a long time in seasonally adjusted terms, suggesting that the
rise in domestic sales have started to support production. In addition, the
recent rebound in the business confidence index signals the possibility of a
partial recovery of economic activity going forward.
12. Although there have been signs of a partial recovery in economic activity,
there is no sign of improvement in labor market conditions. Applications for
unemployment benefits remain high, indicating that unemployment continues
to increase. On balance, the decline in non-farm employment and the high
level of the unemployment rate are both expected to put further downward
pressure on domestic demand and unit labor costs in the upcoming period.
13. Foreign demand remains weak. Exports continued to fall during the first
quarter of 2009 due to global recession. Furthermore, coincident indicators for
April and May exports do not point to a durable recovery in foreign demand.
Although the Business Tendency Survey has shown a partial recovery
regarding expectations for foreign demand more recently, foreign demand
conditions are not expected to improve significantly without a lasting
improvement in the global economic outlook.
Monetary Policy and Risks
14. In light of these assessments, economic activity and employment are not
expected to recover anytime soon, suggesting that downward pressures on
inflation are expected to last going forward. Accordingly, the Committee
indicated that these recent developments are consistent with the outlook
presented in the April Inflation Report and has thus decided to cut policy rates
by 50 basis points.
15. The Committee believes that the rate cuts have lowered the probability of
significantly undershooting the medium-term inflation targets. Recently,
improvement in global risk perceptions and expectations regarding the future
course of policy rates have also contributed to the decline in longer-term
interest rates to historically low levels. In this context, it should be highlighted
that changes in monetary conditions affect economic activity and inflation with
a lag. Therefore, given the cumulative easing in monetary policy since
November 2008, the Committee envisages that the next rate cut may be
measured.
16. However, the tightness in financial conditions still persist to some extent, and
uncertainties regarding the impact of the problems across financial markets on

the real economy are ongoing, suggesting that downside risks still remain.
Although recent indicators regarding the global economic outlook suggests
that the worst may be over, it will nonetheless take some time before the
global financial system recovers, and therefore a full recovery in economic
activity is not likely to be observed anytime soon. Accordingly, it seems
necessary for monetary policy to maintain an easing bias for a considerable
period of time.
17. Another major factor affecting inflation and monetary policy outlook is the
stance of fiscal policy. Budget revenues continue to decline in line with the
slowdown in economic activity, while expenditures rise owing to
countercyclical fiscal policy, leading to a widening in the budget deficit. The
increasing financing requirement of the government might weaken the
favorable impact of monetary policy decisions on economic activity. The
Committee members hence reiterated that, in order to reap the gains from
short-term expansionary fiscal policy, it was important to commit to a credible
medium-term fiscal framework that would underpin fiscal discipline and debt
sustainability.
18. Central Bank of Turkey will continue to take the necessary measures to
contain the adverse effects of the global financial turmoil on the domestic
economy, provided that they do not conflict with the price stability objective.
Prudent monetary policy is necessary but not sufficient to maintain the
resilience of the economy against the global crisis. Therefore, strengthening
the commitment to fiscal discipline and the structural reform agenda is also
critical for facilitating expectations management and for supporting the
effectiveness of the monetary policy decisions. In this respect, commitment to
the European Union accession process, and timely implementation of the
structural reforms envisaged in the Pre-Accession Economic Program remain
to be of utmost importance.
