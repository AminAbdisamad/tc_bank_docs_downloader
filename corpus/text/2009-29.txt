M. İbrahim Turhan, Abdullah Yavaş, Mehmet Yörükoğlu.

Inflation Developments
1. Consumer prices decreased by 0.30 percent in August, bringing inflation down
to 5.33 percent year-on-year. Core inflation measures remained low, while the
annual rate of increase in the prices of services continued to fall steadily.
2. The rate of increase in food prices dropped by 1.67 percentage points monthon-month to 6.83 percent year-on-year, on the back of easing unprocessed
food prices, owing to falling vegetable and fruit prices. In the processed food
category, prices continued to decline year-on-year, however, annual inflation
across this category is likely to increase owing to base effects in coming
months.
3. Energy prices increased by 1.88 percent in August. Fuel prices jumped by
5.02 percent due to the lagged impact of the mid-July Special Consumption
Tax hike and rising oil prices. Moreover, the increase in tap water rates drove
energy prices higher.
4. The annual rate of increase in the prices of goods excluding energy and food
climbed to 5.70 percent in August, owing to the rise in annual clothing inflation
and the monthly increase (1.83 percent) in prices of durable goods (excluding
gold) and tobacco products. The seasonal discounts on clothing prices have
been more modest than a year earlier because of the relative increase in
clothing demand. Meanwhile, the annual inflation in durable goods (excluding
gold) increased to –1.71 percent amid rising prices of white goods and
automobiles. It should be noted that the tax cuts are due to expire in October,
which will likely put upward pressure on annual durable goods inflation in the
upcoming period.
5. Given the weak state of domestic demand and the gradual removal of the high
base effect of the past supply shocks, the steady fall in services prices over
the past year continued into August, bringing the inflation rate in this category
down to 5.59 percent year-on-year. Across subcategories, inflation in transport

services, rents, as well as restaurants and hotels continued to fall gradually.
Annual services inflation is expected to edge further down over the short run.
6. Overall, the Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) noted that underlying
inflation continues to hover around low levels.
Factors Affecting Inflation
7. Second quarter national accounts data are consistent with the outlook
discussed in the July Inflation Report. Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
continued to decline year-on-year, but rose sharply quarter-on-quarter in
seasonally adjusted terms, signaling that the economic contraction since the
second quarter of 2008 has ended. Domestic demand increased on rising
private consumption during the second quarter, and net exports continued to
register a positive contribution to growth, albeit more modestly.
8. As stated in the Central Bank of Turkey’s previous publications and
announcements, the Committee reiterated that consumer spending was
mainly boosted by the fiscal stimulus packages, and thus the observed
recovery may reflect transitory features. Among major spending categories,
the demand for goods that benefited from the fiscal measures recovered
rapidly during the second quarter: spending on furniture, household
appliances and care, as well as transport and communications rose markedly
quarter-on-quarter in seasonally adjusted terms. By contrast, the demand for
categories that were not affected by the fiscal incentives remained flat.
9. Consumption demand, after having increased markedly during the second
quarter, is expected to display a weaker course in the third quarter. In fact,
indicators including the sales of white goods, the quantity of imported
consumer goods, consumption indices and automobile sales are running
below their second quarter levels in seasonally adjusted terms. Moreover, the
indicators of market orders and consumer confidence from the Business
Tendency Survey seem to reinforce this outlook.
10. Domestic investment demand remains weak. Despite the marked run-up in
consumer demand during the second quarter, private machinery and
equipment investments continued to fall quarterly, indicating that demand
uncertainty remains strong over the upcoming periods. Imports of capital
goods declined in July from a quarter earlier, while the Business Tendency
Survey indicator of expected future fixed capital investment spending points to
a further year-on-year decline in private sector investments. The Committee
noted that low capacity utilization rates and uncertainties over aggregate
demand will likely further weigh down on investment demand.

11. Foreign demand continues to be weak. The export quantity index continued to
fall year-on-year in July, but increased sharply month-on-month in seasonally
adjusted terms. Leading indicators suggest that exports continued to grow in
August and September, albeit at a slower pace. The Committee noted that
exports are expected to recover gradually, matching the pace of global
economic recovery, and reemphasized that foreign demand is therefore likely
to remain anemic for quite some time.
12. In July, industrial production increased month-on-month in seasonally adjusted
terms, running above its second quarter average. The uptrend in capacity
utilization rates since April continued into August. The manufacturing industry
capacity utilization rate and recent export data suggest that the moderate
recovery in industrial production is likely to continue into August and
September.
13. Uncertainties regarding aggregate demand remain high and continue to
adversely affect labor markets. Specifically, labor market conditions do not
display a significant improvement. During May-July, non-farm employment
dropped by 2.5 percent year-on-year, while non-farm unemployment increased
by 4.5 percentage points to 16.4 percent. In seasonally adjusted terms, while
non-farm unemployment fell slightly quarter-on-quarter, the decline was
because of a drop in labor participation rate rather than a recovery in
employment. Moreover, employment losses are still apparent across industrial
sectors in seasonally adjusted terms, indicating that the labor market has yet
to recover. Looking ahead, leading indicators do not point to a marked
recovery in employment conditions during the third quarter.
Monetary Policy and Risks
14. Committee members have indicated that the future course of monetary policy
will largely depend on the strength of the recovery in economic activity.
Although second quarter GDP figures seem to reflect a bounce-back in private
consumption, inspection of the subcomponents reveals that the increase in
consumption is confined to goods that were subject to tax incentives within the
fiscal package, suggesting that a durable recovery has yet to materialize. As a
matter of fact, recent data releases indicate that, in line with the Committee’s
previous assessments, the ongoing recovery in economic activity will be
gradual and protracted. Accordingly, resource utilization in the economy is
anticipated to stay below potential for an extended period, and therefore, in
line with the perspective outlined in the Inflation Report, inflation is expected to
remain at low levels for a long period of time.
15. Provided that the improvements in global risk perceptions continue, the
Committee expects that the cumulative policy rate cuts implemented since

November 2008 would begin to have an effect on credit markets over the
forthcoming period. In this context, consumer loan rates have been falling
steadily since the publication of the July Inflation Report. Also during this
period, banks’ willingness to extend credits have been increasing markedly,
and tightness in financial conditions have been easing. These developments
suggest that the credit channel would start to be more effective going forward.
16. However, the weakness in labor markets is ongoing and lingering problems
across the global economy have not been resolved completely, suggesting
that there are still uncertainties regarding the strength of the recovery. In this
respect, the Committee members stated that the improvement in credit
conditions would not in itself be enough to end the easing cycle. Yet, given the
increased perceptions that the economy had reached a turning point, it was
concluded that a slowdown in the pace of rate cuts might be considered,
keeping the options open depending on incoming information.
17. Overall, the Committee has reiterated that it would be necessary for monetary
policy to maintain an easing bias for a long period of time. The size and the
duration of the rate cuts would depend on the pace of the recovery in
economic activity.
18. Another factor affecting the outlook for monetary policy would be changes in
risk perceptions. The global crisis has highlighted the resilience of the Turkish
financial system, leading to an improvement of our relative creditworthiness.
Provided that the global risk appetite continues to improve in the forthcoming
period, this could lead to a decline in imported inflation through the portfolio
channel, increasing the probability of significantly undershooting the inflation
targets. Under such circumstances, the Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) would
react by extending the easing cycle more than was envisaged in the Inflation
Report.
19. An important factor that may affect the risk premium is fiscal policy. Should the
framework outlined in the Medium Term Program be supported by structural
adjustments which enhance fiscal discipline, the improvements in sovereign
credit risk might continue, which in turn, would increase the probability of a
further decline in interest rates. In sum, further improvements in the risk
premium may lead to a longer rate cut cycle.
20. The CBT has been taking the necessary measures at its disposal to contain
the adverse effects of the global crisis on the domestic economy. Monetary
policy in the past year has focused on alleviating the impact of the global
financial crisis on the economic activity. In this respect, the CBT has delivered
sizeable cuts in policy rates, while providing liquidity support to facilitate the
smooth operation of credit and financial markets. Prudent monetary policy is
necessary but not sufficient to maintain the resilience of the economy against

the global crisis. Therefore, strengthening the commitment to fiscal discipline
and the structural reform agenda is also critical for facilitating expectations
management and for supporting the effectiveness of the monetary policy
decisions. In this respect, timely implementation of the structural reforms
envisaged by the Medium Term Program and European Union accession
process remains to be of utmost importance.
