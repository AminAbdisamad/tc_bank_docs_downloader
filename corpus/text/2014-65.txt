DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Participating Committee Members
Erdem Başçı (Governor), Ahmet Faruk Aysan, Murat Çetinkaya, Turalay Kenç, Necati
Şahin, Abdullah Yavaş, Mehmet Yörükoğlu.

The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short
term interest rates constant at the following levels:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 11.25 percent, the interest
rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at
10.75 percent, and borrowing rate at 7.5 percent,
b) One-week repo rate at 8.25 percent,
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing
rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.75 percent.
Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary
policy stance and macroprudential measures. Exports remain supportive of balanced
growth in spite of weakening global demand.
Macroprudential measures taken at the beginning of the year and the tight
monetary policy stance continue to have a favorable impact on the core inflation trend.
However, elevated food prices delay the improvement in the inflation outlook.
Meanwhile, current levels of commodity prices, in particular declining oil prices, are
expected to contribute to disinflation foreseen for the next year.
Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will
be closely monitored and the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained, by
keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation
outlook.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the
Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five
working days.
