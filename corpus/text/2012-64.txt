under reverse repurchase agreements will be recorded as off -balance -

between the Turkish Accounting Standards and the Tax Procedure Law, 
will be calculated and reported as a new balance sheet item,  
3) The interest income and expense accruals will be reported  on their related 
asset or liability item,  
4) Shares will be recorded in their actual and fair values instead of their 
acquisition values.  
In addition to the above changes, some changes will be made in the names 
and classification of balance sheet items and  the amounts in the balance sheet will 
be displayed in 3 columns. The balance sheet of the CBRT to be issued after
