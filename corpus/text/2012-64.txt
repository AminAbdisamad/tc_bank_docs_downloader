PRESS RELEASE ON THE CHANGES TO BE MADE TO THE BALANCE SHEET
AND THE ANALYTICAL BALANCE SHEET OF THE CBRT
Pursuant to the Turkish Commercial Code (Law No.6102) and the relevant
legislation, some changes have been made to the balance sheet of the Central Bank
of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT).
Accordingly, the below changes will be effective as of 1 January 2013;
1) Securities purchased under repurchase agreements and securities sold
under reverse repurchase agreements will be recorded as off-balancesheet items,
2) The deferred tax, which will occur due to implementation differences
between the Turkish Accounting Standards and the Tax Procedure Law,
will be calculated and reported as a new balance sheet item,
3) The interest income and expense accruals will be reported on their related
asset or liability item,
4) Shares will be recorded in their actual and fair values instead of their
acquisition values.
In addition to the above changes, some changes will be made in the names
and classification of balance sheet items and the amounts in the balance sheet will
be displayed in 3 columns. The balance sheet of the CBRT to be issued after
1 January 2013 and the equivalents of the new balance sheet items on the current
balance sheet are presented in Appendix 1.
Meanwhile, some changes will be made and take effect as of 1 January 2013
on the analytical balance sheet that has been prepared and issued by the CBRT
since 1980 to allow the public and relevant stakeholders to analyze the CBRT’s
policies;
1) The items, which are no longer used, will be removed from the balance
sheet,
2) The “Revaluation Account” subtitle under “Domestic Assets” title, will
be shown as a separate item.
3) The names of some items will be changed.
The equivalents of the new Analytical Balance Sheet items to be issued after
1 January 2013 on the current Analytical Balance Sheet are shown in Appendix 2;

and the equivalents of the new Analytical Balance Sheet items on the new Balance
Sheet are shown in Appendix 3.
