PRESS  RELEASE  
6 November  2017  
Press  Release  on Rediscount  Credits  for Export  and Foreign  
Exchange  Earning  Services   
In the recent  period,  the markets  have  witnessed  unsound  price  formations  that are 
inconsistent  with  economic  fundamentals.   
Taking  this development  into account,  it has been  decided  that the repayments  of 
rediscount  credits  for export  and foreign  exchange  earning  services,  which  will be 
due by 1 February  2018  (included),  can be made  in Turkish  liras at an exchange  rate 
of 3.7000 for the USD,  4.3000 for the Euro,  and 4.8000 for the GBP,  provided  that 
they  are paid  at maturity.  In case  the exchange  rate on the date  of credit  extension  is 
higher  than  these  rates,  the exchange  rate on the date  of credit  extension  will be 
applicabl e.
