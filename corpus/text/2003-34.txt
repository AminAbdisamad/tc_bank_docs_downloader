THE CBRT PRESS RELEASE
A) THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE BUYING AUCTION PROGRAM FOR AUGUST
Considering that strong reserve position would boost the marketâ€™s confidence in the
current program and observing the excess foreign exchange supply, the Central Bank of
Turkey (CBRT) started to hold foreign exchange buying auctions on 6 May 2003.
Through foreign exchange buying auctions, the CBRT bought USD 1.960 billion in
total, USD 340 million of which in May, USD 630 million in June, and USD 990 million in
July. Moreover, the USD 2.083 billion in total was bought by means of outright buying
interventions made in May (USD 579 million), in June (USD 566 million) and in July (USD
938 million) upon excessive volatility in exchange rates. Hence, total amount of USD 4.043
billion was bought by means of foreign exchange buying auctions and foreign exchange
outright buying interventions in May, June and July.
It is predicted that the excess supply in foreign exchange market occurred in May-July
period should continue also in August due to the seasonal factors. Therefore, it has been
decided to announce a monthly foreign exchange buying auction program for August as well,
and the total amount of daily foreign exchange buying will be USD 50 million. Accordingly,
foreign exchange buying auctions are to be held on 21 working days throughout the August,
and the maximum amount to be bought will be USD 1.050 million.
As usual, the CBRT will continue to closely monitor the volatility in exchange rates
and will directly intervene in the market in case of an excessive volatility in both directions.
Moreover, as were announced by previous press releases, the CBRT may, with a prior notice,
suspend the auctions before the end of the period in the cases where the depth of foreign
exchange market is lost and excessive volatility is observed in exchange rates due to an
external shock or unpredictable developments.
B) THE TL DEPOSIT BUYING AUCTION PROGRAM FOR AUGUST
The CBRT will continue to conduct Turkish Lira buying auctions in August 2003 with
a standard four-week maturity that was initiated in April 2002 as a supplement to its existing
instruments in the Interbank Money Market with the aim of enhancing the effectiveness of its
efforts to sterilize the excess Turkish lira liquidity in the system.
Turkish lira buying auctions will be held every week on Wednesday and Friday as
before, and the maximum amount to be bought in every auction will be TL 100 trillion.
