PRESS RELEASE ON REQUIRED RESERVES

In its interim meeting held on 4 August 2011, Monetary Policy Committee has agreed
to provide foreign exchange liquidity, if necessary, via appropriate methods and
instruments.
At the meetings dated 23 August 2011 and 20 September 2011, the Committee has
also stated that, given the uncertainties regarding the global economy, it is important
to monitor all developments closely, and to take the required policy measures in a
timely manner.
In this framework, in order to provide foreign exchange liquidity to the market, and at
the same time, to lengthen the maturity structure of liabilities in the banking sector,
the foreign exchange (FX) required reserve ratios are re-determined as follows:

FX Liabilities

private current accounts, deposits/participation
accounts up to 1-month, up to 3-month, up to 6month and up to 1-year maturities.
FX deposits / participation accounts with 1-year
and longer maturity and cumulative FX deposits /
participation account
Other FX liabilities up to 1-year maturity (including
1-year)
Other FX liabilities up to 3-year maturity (including
3-year)
