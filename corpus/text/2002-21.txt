PRESS RELEASE

FEBRUARY INFLATLON, FORWARD-LOOKING EXPECTATLONS AND
İNTEREST RATES

I. GENERAL EVALUATTION

1 In February 2002, monthly increases in the CPIİ and WPI were realized at 1,8
percent and 2,6 percent respectively. Annual inflation figures, which materialized at 73 1
percent in CPI and 91,8 percent in WPLI, have slowed down for the first time since March
2001. (Table 1).

2. Apart from agricultural and food prices, in the price indexes we may more clearly
see that inflation have entered into a downward trend during the last couple of months. As a
matter of fact, in February the increase in CPI (excluding food) was 1,3 percent, while the
increase in WPI (excluding agriculture) was 0,6 percent.

3. The slowing-down process we have seen in recent months in the Annual Inflation
Tendency, which is calculated by annualizing the de-seasonalized consumer and wholesale price
indexes according to the guarterİy moving averages, has become more evident in February. As
of February, the annual inflation trend has fallen to 50,6 percent in CPI, and 54 1 percent in
WPI. The downward trend is more evident in WPI (excluding agriculture) and in CPI
(excluding food), which are realized at 20,6 percent and 41,7 percent respectively.

Developments in Consumer Prices
4, In February, the increase in the CPI lagged well behind the last four years average,

which was considerably below the market expectations. Besides the successful implementation
of the Transition Program for Strengthening the Turkish Economy, the risk premium began to
diminish resulting from the increased confidence in the continuation of fiscal and monetary
discipline in 2002, which had already started in ÖOctober 2001. These positive developments
have helped the inflation expectations to come close to targets by strengthening the
plausibility of the economic program.

5. Moreover, the reduction of VAT ratios in durable goods that had been raised in
January leading to high price increases, and the persisting subdued demand have limited the
CPI monthly increases.

6. Although agricultural prices went up significantİy at the end of 2001 and in
January and February 2002 due to adverse weather conditions, the price increases in food
sector slowed down in February and stood at 3,2 percent. The fact that consumers have
switched to substituting goods and the prices of processed foods have slowed down due to İow
demand may explain the reason why the prices in food sector remained İimited despite high
price increases in fresh vegetables and fruits. Despite the slowing-down trend in February,
food prices have shown an increase of 59,3 percent in the 6 month-period covering September
2001 - February 2002.

7. Monthly price movements in the CPIİ goods basket were mostİy greater than those of
in the service basket in the wake of the February 2001 crisis. However, a reverse trend was
observed in February 2002 and the monthly increase in goods prices remained below the
ihcrease in service prices. İIn February, the goods prices increased by 1,5 percent, while
service prices increased by 2,3 percent. If we omit the food sector, the increase in goods
prices has materialized at 0,5 percent. Lower than expected food price increases on one hand,
and the price increases in house rents, hospital services, medical services and restaurant
services on the other hand have caused the service sector prices to materialize above the
goods sector prices, despite the seasonally lowered clothing sector prices.
Developments in Wholesale Prices

8. The main element affecting the
wholesale inflation in February was the
increase in agricultural prices by 8,9
percent. However, the increase in WPI
remained below the expectations, despite
the rise in agricultural prices. The
appreciation of Turkish Lira during the
last four months on one hand, and the
decreasing trend in public sector price
adjustments on the other hand, which was
helped also by positive exchange rate
developments, have led to a decline in
production — costs. — Therefore, — the
downward trend observed in private
manufacturing industry price increases
persisted in February and prices in this
sector rose by onİy O,7 percent.

9. We consider the February inflation as an important development, completely
removing the possible adverse effects of the high price increases in January on the
expectations and supporting the belief that the year-end inflation target would be hit.

* The selection of the appropriate mean is done by comparing mean, median,
mode, and alpha-trimmed mean.

10. An overal| look into the recent data gathered by surveys for inflation expectations
reveals that the general downward tendency that had started in the last months of 2001
continues to do so (Table 2).

11. According to the January 2002 CBRT Business Tendency Survey, which covers the
WPLI expectations, the expected inflation rate for the 12 months onward has declined to 55,3
percent from 58 ,1 percent in December 2001. The expected year-end WPI is 57,6 percent.

12. According to the results of the CBRT Survey of Expectations for the first period
of March, the expected CPI rate for the 12 months onward has declined to 39,8 percent from

43,3 percent. The expected year-end CPI has receded to 43 6 per'cen'r.[l]

13. İt is expected that the continuation of stability in the exchange rate in the months
to come and the moving of public sector prices in tandem with the targeted inflation will
improve the inflation expectations even further. However, the rises we are observing in oil
prices might create a risk for inflation in the future months.

14. Realizations in the monetary base and in the primary consolidated budget surplus
are in conformity with the previousİy announced targets. This reality is increasing the
credibility of the economic program and is improving the expectations. İn line with these
developments, our positive stance is also supported by the continuation of structural reforms.
The preparation of a public sector borrowing draft-law is an example of this.

IIİI- CENTRAL BANK INTEREST RATES

15. İn the light of evaluations for the period ahead of us, we have decided to decrease the
short-term interest rates we apply in the Interbank Money Market and in the Istanbul Stock
Exchange Repurchase - Reverse Repurchase Market effective 14 March 2002 as following:

a) Övernight İnterest Rates: Our borrowing rate has been decreased from 57
percent to 54 percent, and our İending rate has been decreased from 62 percent
to 61 percent.

b) — Weekly Interest Rates: Our borrowing rate for one week has been decreased
from 59 percent to 55 percent.
D The difference between the inflation expectation values obtained from two surveys is noteworthy. The first reason is
that the one measures WPlI expectations, while the other one measures CPİI expectations. The second reason is that
the Business Tendency Survey is conducted once in a month and the data at hand show the survey results that were
sent to respondents in the first week of January and answered before the end of the third week of February. On the
other hand, the Survey of Expectations is conducted twice a month and shows the results of the first period of March.
The third reason is the existence of a two different respondent groups. The first survey covers 1.000 big industrial firms,
while the second one gives emphasis on financial sector.
