The Monetary Policy Committee (Committee) has decided to increase shortterm interest rates (policy rates) in the Inter-bank Money Market and the Istanbul
Stock Exchange Repo-Reverse Repo Market as follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: The overnight borrowing interest rate is increased
to 17.50 percent from 17.25 percent, and the overnight lending interest rate is
increased to 22.50 percent from 22.25 percent.
b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Within the framework of the Late
Liquidity Window Facility, the overnight borrowing interest rate valid between 4:00
p.m. – 4:30 p.m. in the Inter-bank Money Market is increased to 13.50 percent from
13.25 percent while the lending interest rate is increased to 25.50 percent from 25.25
percent.
c) The interest rates on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities
provided for primary dealer banks via repo transactions within the framework of open
market transactions are increased to 21.50 percent from 21.25 percent.
The Committee perceives that the recent rise in inflation will continue in July
due to the lagged exchange rate pass-through. The measures taken in June by the
Central Bank is expected to ease the pressures on inflation in the forthcoming period.
However, there is still need to remain cautious for inflation because oil and other
commodity prices are still increasing and the expectations are not yet in line with the
medium-term targets. Taken all these factors into account, the Committee decided to
move toward a measured tightening of monetary policy in order to achieve the 2007
year-end inflation target.
In light of the existing risks, the Committee considers that the cautious stance
is more likely to continue for some time. Under a cautious stance, the downward trend
in inflation is expected to be significant in the second quarter of 2007. In the
forthcoming period, the developments in the international liquidity conditions, the
course of domestic demand, pricing behavior and the public sector income policy will
be monitored closely.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information associated with the
inflation outlook will potentially lead the Monetary Policy Committee to revise its
future stance.
A brief summary of the assessments of the Monetary Policy Committee will
be released within five working days. Following that, the Inflation Report assessing
the reflections of recent economic developments on the medium-term inflation
outlook will be released on 28 July 2006.
