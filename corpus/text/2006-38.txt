The Monetary Policy Committee (Committee) has decided  to  increase  short-
term interest rates (policy rates)  in the Inter-bank Money Market and the Istanbul 
Stock Exchange Repo-Reverse Repo Market as follows:  
a) Overnight Interest Rates:  The overnight borrowing interest rate is increased 
to  17.50 percent from 17.25  percent, and the overnight lending interest rate is 
increased to 22.50 percent from 22.25  percent.  
b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates:  Within the framework of the Late 
Liquidity Window Facility, the overnight borrowing interest rate vali d between 4:00 
p.m. – 4:30 p.m. in the Inter-bank Money Market is increased to 13.50 percent  from 
13.25  percent while the lending interest rate is increased to 25.50 percent  from 25.25 
percent.  
c) The interest rates on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing fa cilities 
provided for primary dealer banks via repo transactions within the fram ework of open 
market transactions are increased to 21.50 percent  from 21.25 percent. 
 The Committee perceives that the recent rise in inflation will  continue in July 
due to the lagged exchange rate pass-through. The measures taken in J une by the 
Central Bank is expected to ease the pressures on inflation in the forthcoming period. 
However, there is still need to remain cautious for inflation becaus e oil and other 
commodity prices are still increasing and the expectations are not yet in line with the 
medium-term targets. Taken all these factors into account, the Com mittee decided to 
move toward a measured tightening of monetary policy in order to achie ve the 2007 
year-end inflation target.  
In light of the existing risks, the Committee considers that the cautious stance 
is more likely to continue for some time. Under a cautious stance, t he downward trend 
in inflation is expected to be significant in the second quarter of 2007. In the 
forthcoming period, the developments in the international liquidity conditions, the 
course of domestic demand, pricing behavior and the public sector income poli cy will 
be monitored closely. 
It should be emphasized that any new data or information associated wi th the 
inflation outlook will potentially lead the Monetary Policy Committe e to revise its 
future stance.  
A brief summary of the assessments of the Monetary Policy Comm ittee will 
be released within five working days. Following that, the Inflation Re port assessing 
the reflections of recent economic developments on the medium-term inf lation 
outlook will be released on 28 July 2006.
