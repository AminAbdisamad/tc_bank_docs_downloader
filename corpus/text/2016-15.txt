DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Participating Committee Members
Murat Çetinkaya (Governor), Ahmet Faruk Aysan, Turalay Kenç, Necati Şahin, Abdullah Yavaş, Mehmet
Yörükoğlu.

The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as
follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been reduced from 10.50 percent to 10
percent, and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.25 percent,
b) One-week repo rate has been kept at 7.5 percent,
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been
kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been reduced from 12 percent to 11.50 percent.
Annual loan growth continues at reasonable rates in response to the tight monetary policy stance and
macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of
consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. Demand from the European
Union economies continues to support exports at an increasing pace, despite elevated geopolitical risks in
other export markets. Recent data and the leading indicators show that economic activity displays a
moderate and stable course of growth. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural
reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly.
Recently, decline in the global volatility has continued and global financial conditions have improved. Along
with these developments, the effective use of the policy instruments laid out in the road map published in
August 2015 has reduced the need for a wide interest rate corridor. In this respect, the Committee decided
to take a measured step towards simplification.
Recently, inflation displayed a marked decline, which was mainly due to unprocessed food prices. This
decline is expected to continue in the short run. However, improvement in the underlying core inflation
trend remains limited, necessitating the maintenance of a tight liquidity stance.
Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation
expectations, pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy
stance will be maintained.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days.
