CENTRAL BANK OF THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
PRESS RELEASE

A)PHASING OUT INTERMEDIATION FUNCTION IN THE FOREIGN
EXCHANGE AND BANKNOTES MARKETS

Following the announcement in the Central Bank’s press release titled “Monetary
Policy and Exchange Rate Policy in 2002 and Prospective Developments”, dated January 2,
2002 with reference no: 2002-1, the Central Bank started to phase out its intermediary role in
the Foreign Exchange and Banknotes Markets during 2002. By abandoning its
intermediation function, the Central Bank aims at a deeper

foreign exchange market,

enabling the creation of a pricing behaviour which fully reflects the risk perceptions. It also
aims at avoiding the transmission of mixed messages to the markets with regard to monetary
and foreign exchange policies, because some operations performed in these markets are
perceived as if the Central Bank were the counter party.
Within this framework, the interbank transactions carried out among the market
participants were terminated in the FX deposits against TL deposits (swap) market and
forward FX purchase/sale against TL (forward) market on March 1, 2002 and in the foreign
banknotes purchase/sale against TL market on July 1, 2002. The Central Bank began to
phase out its intermediary function in the foreign exchange deposits market starting on July
1, 2002 to be completely terminated on December 2, 2002.

As of September 2, 2002, the transactions, conducted among those institutions,
authorized to deal in the FX purchase/sale against TL market with the intermediation of the
Central Bank, will be terminated in accordance with the schedule announced in the abovementioned press release of the Central Bank.

B) TURKISH LIRA DEPOSIT BUYING AUCTIONS PROGRAM FOR
SEPTEMBER
In September, the Central Bank will continue to conduct Turkish Lira deposit buying
auctions with a standard maturity of 4 weeks that were initiated in April 2002 as a
supplement to its existing instruments with the aim of enhancing the effectiveness of its
efforts to sterilize the excess Turkish Lira liquidity in the system.

As was the case in August, the Central Bank will hold Turkish Lira deposit buying
auctions on Wednesdays and Fridays each week and the maximum amount to be auctioned at
each auction will be limited to 200 trillion Turkish Liras.
