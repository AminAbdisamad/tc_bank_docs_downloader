SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: July 15, 2010

Inflation Developments
1. Consumer prices decreased by 0.56 percent in June and annual inflation
declined by 0.73 percentage points to 8.37 percent. The fall in annual inflation
was due to plummeting food prices, as noted in the June summary of the
Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) Meeting. Annual services
inflation slowed down further, and core inflation indicators continued to be
consistent with medium-term targets.
2. Amid falling unprocessed food prices, annual food inflation sank to 5.62
percent in June—lowest level in recent years. The ongoing drop in fresh fruit
and vegetable prices as well as meat prices also had a major impact on food
prices. With falling processed meat prices in June, the direct impact of meat
prices on annual CPI inflation was down 0.2 percentage point month-on-month
to 1.4 percentage points.
3. The slowdown in annual services inflation became more pronounced in June
as falling meat prices began to have a favorable effect on catering prices.
Moreover, seasonally adjusted data indicate that prices decelerated across all
categories of services. Annual rent inflation continued to trend steadily down,
declining to an unprecedented low of 4.21 percent since the inception of the
CPI.
4. The Committee has noted that the year-ago increase in tobacco prices would
have a base effect on the annual rate of increase in July’s consumer prices. If
tobacco prices remain unchanged in July, this base effect will drive annual CPI
inflation down by about 0.5 percentage point.
5. The effect of rising solid fuel and tap water prices on energy group prices was
broadly offset by the fall in fuel prices amid lower international oil prices,
producing only a modest increase in energy prices in June. However, with the
waning of the upward base effects that the Committee noted in the June
Summary, annual energy inflation dropped by 1.61 percentage points to 12.63

percent. Unless international oil prices rise dramatically, the annual rate of
increase in energy prices would continue to slow in the second half of 2010.
6. The year-on-year rate of increase in core goods (goods excluding food,
energy, alcoholic beverages, tobacco and gold) slowed to 4.38 percent with
the reversal of the base effect from last year’s tax incentives on durable
goods. The Committee has reiterated that the tax impact would continue to
have a downward impact on annual core goods inflation in July and October.
Moreover, Committee members have emphasized that, even when adjusted
for tax effects and seasonal variations, the rate of increase in prices of core
goods has been decelerating.
7. The Committee has noted that annual headline inflation would display a
significant drop in July due to aforementioned base effects.

Factors Affecting Inflation
8. Recent data suggest that the recovery in economic activity is ongoing. Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) expanded by 11.7 percent year-on-year during the
first quarter owing primarily to the low base in the comparable period last year.
In fact, growing by a mere 0.1 percent quarter-on-quarter in seasonally
adjusted terms, GDP remained virtually flat. The Committee has noted the
large contraction in public construction investments, and indicated that
economic activity continues to pick up once the impact of the public sector
demand is excluded.
9. Industrial production increased by 1.9 percent month-on-month during May in
seasonally adjusted terms, up by 3 percent from the first-quarter average
during April-May. The Committee has indicated that production has surpassed
pre-crisis levels in sectors more sensitive to domestic demand but still remains
low in sectors relatively more sensitive to foreign demand.
10. Domestic demand is displaying relatively stable growth. April-May data on
production and imports indicate that the demand for consumer goods has
been running above its previous quarter average. Consumer confidence
indices and new orders data also point to a further increase in private
consumption. Therefore, the Committee expects private consumption demand
to grow further quarter-on-quarter during the second quarter but slow down
year-on-year as impacts of the low base effect fades.
11. Investment demand continues to recover, but remains below pre-crisis levels.
The production of capital goods excluding vehicles continues to grow steadily,
while imports of capital goods remain on the rise. Production and imports data
suggest that private investments would increase significantly year-on-year

during the second quarter of 2010. Yet, the Committee has stated that the
recently increased downside risks to foreign demand owing to the problems in
the euro area might dampen new investments, particularly in the
manufacturing industry.
12. There are signs of a partial slowdown in foreign demand. The export quantity
index excluding gold rose for the fourth consecutive month in May, although
recent readings indicate that the massive second-quarter increase in exports
may not be durable. According to the data from the Turkish Exporters
Assembly, despite having expanded by 13.1 percent year-on-year in June,
exports were down month-on-month in seasonally adjusted terms. Moreover,
recent survey indicators for the manufacturing industry signal slowing export
orders.
13. The Committee has reiterated that the downside risks to the pace of foreign
demand growth have risen amid the fiscal crisis in the euro area—Turkey’s
largest export destination—and emphasized that the depreciation of the euro
is another factor that would impede exports. While the July Consensus
Forecasts do not offer a major change in euro area growth rates, there are
significant compositional changes. Specifically, the decreased contribution of
consumption and investment expenditures, especially in countries such as
Germany and Italy, implies a weaker outlook for foreign demand of Turkey.
The Committee has noted that these developments are likely to have an
adverse impact on Turkey’s economic activity in coming months, implying that
it would take a while before industrial capacity utilization rates return to precrisis levels.
14. Although employment conditions continue to improve, unemployment rates
remain at high levels. Seasonally adjusted data indicate that non-farm
employment continued to recover in April. Weak foreign demand continued to
restrain industrial employment, while non-farm employment returned to precrisis levels owing to the recovery in construction and services sectors.
Nevertheless, the Committee reiterated that the high level of unemployment
rates would continue to contain unit labor costs.
Monetary Policy and Risks
15. The Committee discussed the macroeconomic outlook and monetary policy
stance underlying the baseline scenario of the July Inflation Report. In light of
the developments summarized above, the Committee members indicated that
it would be appropriate to base the revised forecasts on a framework in which
external demand conditions are weaker compared to the previous Report,
while domestic demand continues to recover as anticipated, resource
utilization stays at low levels, and thus the contribution of aggregate demand
conditions to disinflation increases slightly.

16. The Committee has indicated that the core inflation indicators remain
consistent with the medium term targets. This development, coupled with the
fall in unprocessed food prices and easing commodity prices, has led to a
more favorable inflation outlook than envisaged in the April Inflation Report.
17. In sum, the Committee members agreed that the baseline scenario in the July
Inflation Report would envisage that the monetary tightening required to keep
inflation in line with medium-term targets would start later and would be more
limited compared to the previous forecast. Accordingly, the Committee
reiterated that it may be necessary to maintain policy rates at current levels for
some time, and to keep them at low levels for a long period.
18. The Committee stated that risks regarding global economy persist. By
influencing commodity prices and external demand conditions, global
economic activity would continue to be the main factor driving inflation
dynamics and the monetary policy outlook. In this respect, the Committee
indicated that the timing and the extent of monetary tightening to be
implemented during 2011 under the baseline scenario of the July Inflation
Report may change depending on the course of the economic activity.
19. Recently, rising concerns regarding debt sustainability in several euro-zone
countries and the spillover effects to the financial system have led to renewed
turmoil across financial markets, underscoring the downside risks to the global
economic recovery. Furthermore, ongoing problems in credit, real estate and
labor markets across developed economies, with little policy options left in
case of another disruption to global economic activity, suggest that the
downside risks regarding the pace of global growth are likely to persist for
some time. The Committee indicated that, should the global economy face a
longer-than-anticipated period of anemic growth, which would consequently
delay the domestic recovery significantly, the monetary tightening envisaged in
2011 under the baseline scenario may be postponed towards the end of 2011.
Moreover, it was stated that, an outcome whereby global economic problems
intensify and contribute to a contraction of domestic economic activity, may
trigger a new easing cycle. By contrast, the Committee members underscored
that, monetary tightening may be implemented in an earlier period during
2011, should the recovery in economic activity turn out to be faster than
expected.
20. The Committee members indicated that, despite the increased downside risks
pertaining to external demand, domestic demand remains strong. Although
problems regarding the global economy have the potential to restrain domestic
demand through confidence and financing channels, countercyclical monetary
policy and the ongoing improvement in employment conditions are likely to
support the recovery in domestic demand. On the other hand, given the

relative improvement in the creditworthiness of Turkey during the post-crisis
period, a possible strengthening in capital inflows in the forthcoming period
stands out as another factor that may lead to a faster recovery in the domestic
demand in contrast to external demand. Should the divergence in the growth
rates between domestic and external demand continue in the forthcoming
period, it would be necessary to utilize other policy instruments such as
reserve requirement ratios and liquidity management facilities more effectively.
Accordingly, if the composition of strong domestic demand and weak external
demand continue as envisaged, and if this pattern of growth coexists with
rapid credit expansion and a deterioration in the current account balance,
consequently leading to financial stability concerns, than the Committee may
bring forward the measures outlined in the exit strategy that are expected to
be implemented until the end of 2010.
21. The Committee will continue to monitor fiscal policy developments closely
while formulating monetary policy. Since the second half of 2009, economic
activity has been stronger than envisaged in the Medium Term Program
(MTP), leading to a better-than-expected performance in budget revenues.
Using this fiscal space mostly to reduce the government debt would facilitate
demand management and reduce any need for indirect tax hikes, therefore
providing more flexibility regarding the conduct of countercyclical monetary
policy. In this respect, should the fiscal discipline implemented through
institutional and structural improvements, such as enacting and establishing
the fiscal rule, it would be possible to keep policy rates at single-digit levels
over the medium term.
22. Monetary policy will continue to focus on price stability in the period ahead.
Strengthening the commitment to fiscal discipline and the structural reform
agenda would support the improvement of Turkey’s sovereign risk, and thus
facilitate macroeconomic and price stability. In this respect, timely
implementation of the structural reforms envisaged by the MTP and the
European Union accession process remains to be of utmost importance.
