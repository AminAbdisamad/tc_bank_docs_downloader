The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to adjust the short term
interest rates as follows:
a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) has been kept at 5.75 percent.
b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate has been kept at 5 percent while lending
rate has been cut from 11.5 percent to 10 percent. Interest rate on borrowing facilities
provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been cut from 11 percent to 9.5
percent.
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing
rate has been kept at 0 percent while lending rate has been cut from 14.5 percent to 13
percent.
Recent data confirm that the rebalancing between the domestic and external demand
continues as envisaged. As of the third quarter, domestic demand follows a moderate pace,
while exports continue to increase despite the weakening global outlook. Overall, aggregate
demand conditions support disinflation and current account deficit continues to improve
gradually.
The Committee expects the fall in inflation to become more evident during the last
quarter of the year. However, given the recent increases in energy prices and given that inflation
will continue to stay above the target for some time, a cautious stance regarding pricing
behavior is warranted.
Although the risk appetite has improved in financial markets due to recent
developments, ongoing uncertainties regarding the global economy necessitate the monetary
policy to remain flexible on both sides. Therefore, the impact of the measures undertaken on
credit, domestic demand, and inflation expectations will be monitored closely and the funding
amount will be adjusted in either direction, as needed.
The Committee has stated that increasing the reserve option coefficients and narrowing
the interest rate corridor would support financial stability. If deemed necessary, a measured step
in the same direction may be taken in the forthcoming period.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to
revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five
working days.
