Press  Release on Reserve Requirement 
Ratios  
20 August  2020, No: 2020-50 
 
TL and FX reserve requirement  ratios have been raised for banks fulfilling  real credit growth 
conditions . 
 
As part of the normalization process, in its press release of  18 July 2020 , the CBRT announced that 
it increase d FX reserve requirement ratios by 300 basis points in all liability types and maturity 
brackets for all banks.  Now, the CBRT has decided to raise FX reserve requirement ratios for banks 
fulfilling real credit growth conditions by 700 basis points for preci ous metal deposit accounts and 
by 200 basis points for all other FX liabilities for all maturity brackets.  
 Moreover, in line with the recent steps taken towards  the Turkish lira liquidity manageme nt, for 
banks fulfilling the real credit growth condition s:  TL reserve requirement ratios  have been 
increased by 200 basis points for all deposits / participation funds liabilities with a maturity up to 
6 months  and other liabilities with a maturity up to 1 year , and by 150 basis  points for other 
liabilities with a maturity up to 3 years.  
 
As a result of this decision, approximately TRY 17  billion and USD 8 .5 billion of FX and gold 
liquidity is expected to be withdrawn from the market.  
 Thus, with the revision made on 18 July 2020 and this current  arrangement, USD 17.7  billion of FX 
and gold liquidity, which has been injected into the market since 17 March 2020 due to the 
reduction of FX reserve requirement ratios and the fulfilment of  real credit growth conditions by 
some banks for the first time , will be fully withdrawn as part of the normalization .  
 These changes  will be effective from the calculation date of 21 August 2020 with the maintenance 
period starting on 4 September 2020.
