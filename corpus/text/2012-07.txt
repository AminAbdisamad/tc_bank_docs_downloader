As stipulated in the Article 42 of the Central Bank Law, in the case of a
significant breach of the inflation target, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey
(Central Bank) is required to report to the Government and announce to the public
the reasons behind the breach of the target and the necessary measures to be
taken. As stated in the main policy document titled “Monetary and Exchange Rate
Policy in 2011”, which was published on December 21, 2010; the inflation target for
2011 was set jointly with the Government as 5.5 percent. In the same document, it
was also indicated that the Central Bank would write an open letter to the
Government should end-year inflation exceed the target significantly (by more than 2
percentage points in either direction). Inflation reached 10.45 percent at end-2011,
notably exceeding the target. This text elaborates on the reasons why the target was
missed and explains the measures taken—and to be taken—to bring inflation back
to the target.
Factors Affecting Inflation in 2011
The main factors causing inflation to exceed the target significantly in 2011 are
the high rates of increases in import prices and the exchange rate observed through
the year. Between the last quarter of 2010 and end-2011, the rise in the domestic
currency price of imports exceeded 40 percent. This, on its own, is estimated to
have contributed to the annual inflation by approximately 5 percentage points.
Besides the developments in imports prices and the exchange rate, another
reason for the breach of the inflation target is the tax adjustment in tobacco products
in October and the resulting surge in prices. With an annual rate of increase of 18.6
percent, tobacco prices rose well beyond the inflation target in 2011, adding 1.1
percentage points to annual inflation.
Another factor behind the recent surge in inflation is the high rate of increase in
the price of unprocessed food stemming from excessive volatility. The annual rate of
increase in unprocessed food prices was 15 percent in 2011, contributing by around
2 percentage points to CPI inflation.
Overall, the developments in import prices, exchange rates and the prices of
unprocessed food and tobacco products were the main factors behind the breach of
the inflation target at end-2011. Among these factors, the only one that responds to
Central Bank policies is the exchange rate. Therefore, it would be useful to assess
exchange rate developments since end-2010 in the context of policies pursued.

Capital Flows, Monetary Policy and Financial Stability
The ample and low-cost liquidity arising from the extraordinarily loose
monetary policies implemented by advanced economies in the aftermath of the
global crisis fueled short-term capital inflows towards emerging countries as of 2010.
Backed by its strong financial sector and robust growth potential, Turkey has taken a
large share out of these inflows. The appreciation in the Turkish lira and rapid credit
growth driven by increased capital inflows led to a sizeable deterioration in the
current account balance.
Having foreseen that the excessive appreciation in the domestic currency and
the rapid credit growth could challenge the sustainability of macroeconomic stability
over the medium term; the Central Bank opted for a notable change in its policy
strategy and increased the weight of financial stability in its objective function. The
fact that, in this period, inflation remained below the target and continued its
downward trend made it possible for the Central Bank to focus on financial stability.
Accordingly, as of late 2010, the Central Bank embarked on using multiple policy
instruments concurrently, and implemented policies aimed at (i) reducing the credit
growth to reasonable levels (ii) containing domestic currency appreciation that would
disconnect the Turkish lira from economic fundamentals, caused by the
extraordinarily loose monetary policies implemented by industrial countries. The
Central Bank proved successful in both dimensions to a large extent (Chart 1). At
this point, it should be noted that, due to the deterioration in the global risk appetite
since August, the depreciation in the domestic currency went beyond the intended
levels feeding into the faster-than-expected surge in inflation.

In sum, an important part of the gradual depreciation in the Turkish lira
between the last quarter of 2010 and August of 2011 is a natural consequence of
the policies designed to mitigate macro financial risks. These measures helped
contain the effects of the turmoil in the euro area as of August 2011 on our
economy. If Turkey had gone through this period with an excessively appreciated

Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey

domestic currency and a rapidly rising credit growth, the economy could have
experienced a hard landing driven by balance sheet deterioration due to the rapid
fall in the risk appetite.
Policies implemented by the Central Bank with a view to mitigate macro
financial risks have to be consistent with the price stability objective over the
medium and long term. Therefore, temporary price movements should not be
allowed to deteriorate the general price setting behavior. In this context, considering
that a sound rebalancing process in the economy has already started, the Central
Bank has re-focused on price stability as of the last quarter of 2011.
Measures Taken to Bring Inflation back to the Target
In order to prevent the surge in inflation to worsen the price setting behavior,
the Central Bank has delivered a strong monetary tightening since October 2011.
Accordingly, the interest rate corridor was widened upwards and the cost of funding
provided to the market was raised significantly. Moreover, with the aim of minimizing
the adverse effects of abrupt changes in capital flows due to uncertainties regarding
the global economic outlook, a flexible liquidity management strategy was designed
and implemented.
These measures brought credit growth to reasonable levels and inflation
expectations were contained. Accordingly, as the accumulated effects of the price
movements stemming from import prices, exchange rate, and unprocessed food and
tobacco prices fade away, inflation is expected to converge gradually to the target in
the forthcoming period (Chart 2). It should be noted that due to the base effects, the
decline in inflation will remain subdued in the short term and become more
pronounced in the last quarter of 2012.

Reducing inflation from 10.45 percent to 5 percent target within 12 months
would lead to unfavorable fluctuations in economic activity; accordingly, in the
baseline scenario, it takes one and a half year to bring inflation back to the target. In
other words, the baseline scenario envisages inflation to reach the target of 5
percent by mid-2013 (Chart 2). However, the target might be attained by the end of
2012, should the risk appetite improve markedly in the forthcoming period and the
capital flows towards emerging economies re-accelerate, leading to a stronger
appreciation of the Turkish lira than assumed in the baseline scenario.
Risks
The fact that inflation will hover at high levels in the short term poses risks
regarding pricing behavior. Three-month accumulated increase in consumer prices
in the final quarter of year 2011 was 5.66 percent. This will stay in annual inflation
figure for another three quarters. Therefore, it is highly likely that annual inflation will
stay significantly above the target until the last quarter of the year, even if the
underlying trend in the forthcoming period eases to levels consistent with the target.
Although the monetary tightening delivered by the Central Bank since October has
reduced the possibility of second round effects, inflation expectations and pricing
behavior will be monitored closely and necessary measures will be taken to keep
medium-term inflation outlook consistent with the target.
Overall, ongoing problems regarding euro area and uncertainties on the
effectiveness of the measures aimed at solving these problems, suggest that
financial markets will continue to be volatile in the forthcoming period. These
conditions necessitate a flexible approach in monetary policy, which utilizes multiple
instruments. The Central Bank will continue to monitor global developments closely
and take the required measures promptly.
Another risk for the forthcoming period is the uncertainty regarding oil prices.
Although weak global outlook dampens commodity prices, heightened concerns
about oil supply recently pose upside risks regarding energy prices. The Central
Bank will not respond to temporary price movements, yet will not tolerate any
deterioration in expectations.
Excess volatility of unprocessed food prices lead to unpredictable and sharp
movements in inflation. This creates challenges for expectation management and
often leads to undesired fluctuations in financial markets. Taking measures to
reduce the volatility of unprocessed food prices is crucial for attaining price stability
in the medium term. In this respect, especially in the fresh fruit and vegetables
sector, it is important to take the measures such as increasing the market efficiency,
decreasing the sensitivity of production to climate conditions, and improving knowhow and incentive structure.
Monetary policy will continue to focus on price stability while preserving
financial stability as a supplementary objective. The Central Bank will do its best to
mitigate the adverse effects of the volatility in capital flows, by efficiently using the

Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey

instruments at its disposal. However, it should be underscored that continuous
coordination among monetary, fiscal and financial sector policies is crucial,
especially amid such a challenging global backdrop. For the medium and longer
term, strengthening the structural reforms aiming to reduce the saving deficit would
boost the resilience of the economy and reinforce sustainable growth.
Conclusion
Inflation exceeded the target significantly at the end of 2011. Although
depreciation of the Turkish lira explains an important part of this development,
several factors such as commodity prices, tobacco and unprocessed food prices
were also responsible for the breach of the target. The Central Bank has responded
by a bold monetary tightening and contained inflation expectations. Accordingly,
inflation is expected to move towards the target gradually in the forthcoming period.
The Central Bank will continue to monitor developments affecting inflation outlook
and take the necessary measures to retain the achievements on price stability.
