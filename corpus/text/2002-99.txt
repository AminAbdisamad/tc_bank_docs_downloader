A- TURKISH LIRA DEPOSIİT BUYING AUCTIONS PROGRAM FOR
JANUARY 2003

The Central Bank will continue to conduct Turkish lira deposit büying auctions in January
2003 with a standard four-week maturity that was initiated in April 2002 as a supplement to its
existing instruments wıith the aim of enhancing the effectiveness of its efforts to sterilize the
excess Turkish lira liguidity in the system.

As was in December 2002, the Central Bank will hold Turkish lira deposit buying
auctions on Wednesdays and Fridays each week and the maximum amount at each auction will be
limited to 200 trillion Turkish liras.

Because of the impending religious holiday, the maturity date of the auctions to be held
on the January 15th and 17th, 2003 wıll be February 17th, 2003.

B-FOREFIĞN EXCHANGE BUYING AUCTIONS

As stated in our previous press releases, the Central Bank may resume the foreign
exchange buying auctions in case there might be an excess supply of foreign exchange resulting
from the reverse currency substitution process, and the strong balance of payments position.
Developments in the reverse currency substitution process have been closely monitored and
continuousİy evaluated by the Central Bank and Turkish bankıing system. İn the event of a
decision on the resumption of holding programmed foreign exchange buying auctions, the
Central Bank will announce it in due course.
