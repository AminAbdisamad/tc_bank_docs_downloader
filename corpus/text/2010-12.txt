PRESS RELEASE OF THE CENTRAL BANK OF THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
ON THE MONETARY POLICY EXIT STRATEGY

1. Recently, one of the most discussed issues in monetary policies is “exit strategies”,
which include withdrawing measures taken during the global crisis and normalization
operations of monetary policies. In fact, for some time the general public has also
started to discuss the exit strategies that will be carried out by the Central Bank of the
Republic of Turkey (Central Bank). Due to the importance attached to transparency and
predictability, the Central Bank has decided to inform the public about the general
framework of its exit strategy before starting to implement it.
2.

The global economy experienced the deepest crisis since the Great Depression in 1929.
However, the very courageous, decisive and effective measures taken by central banks
in a coordinated way reduced the destructive effects of the crisis and shortened the exit
duration from the crisis. During the crisis, especially the central banks of developed
countries provided extraordinary levels of liquidity to the markets and all kind of
monetary policy tools were used courageously, without hesitation about risks of
deterioration of their balance sheets. Due to the financial support programs
implemented during the crisis period, government budget deficits also reached very
high levels. However, implementing unusually loose monetary policies and
expansionary fiscal policies for an extended period, on the one hand, may cause new
potential economic imbalances, on the other hand increases the risk of inflation, which
might be very costly to control in the future.

3. Indeed, many central banks have been working on exit strategies for a long time as the
adverse effects of the crisis diminish and the signals of economic recovery strengthen,
and they have been preparing the markets for the normalization process. Of course, each
central bank will form its own exit strategy according to their country specific
conditions, such as improvements in their financial markets, economic recovery and
inflationary pressure. Turkey, with both a very strong and well-regulated banking
system and a flexible and effective liquidity management framework suitable for every
condition, formed with the experience gained from several crises, was fairly well
prepared for the global crisis period. These conditions have reduced the need for the
1

Central Bank to take additional radical measures and the structure of the Central Bank’s
balance sheet was not damaged during the crisis period. Therefore, the Central Bank’s
exit strategy from the crisis period will be more simple and easier than that of other
central banks’.
4. As the crisis began to deepen in October 2008, the Central Bank established a strong
line of communication with the public about details of the existing liquidity
management strategy and its robust structure, and the liquidity facilities to be provided
were outlined step by step, in a clear and transparent way. Subsequently, the announced
measures for both Turkish lira and foreign exchange markets have gradually been
introduced, and tensions and volatilities in the markets have been reduced considerably.

Measures and Exit Strategy for Foreign Exchange Markets

5. The Central Bank has taken the following measures related to the foreign exchange
markets and the foreign exchange liquidity of the banking system during the crisis:
a. Foreign exchange buying auctions were suspended starting from 16 October
2008, providing the liquidity, which has been permanently withdrawn from the
foreign exchange market through foreign exchange buying auctions, to be kept
in the system.
b. As unhealthy price formations were witnessed in the foreign exchange market
due to a decrease in the depth of the market, USD 100 million in total was sold
to the market through foreign exchange selling auctions on 24 October 2008 and
27 October 2008.
c. In October 2008, the Central Bank resumed its intermediary functions related to
foreign exchange deposits and gradually increased the transaction limits of
banks in the Foreign Exchange Deposit Market to USD 10.8 billion. Moreover,
the maturity of foreign exchange deposits borrowed within the predetermined
borrowing limits by the banks from the Foreign Exchange Deposit Markets was
extended from 1 week to 1 month, and the borrowing rate for transactions where
the Central Bank is a counterparty was reduced from 10.0 percent to 7.0 percent
for US Dollar, and 9.0 percent for Euro. In February 2009, the maturity of the
foreign exchange deposits have been extended from a maximum of 1 month to 3
months and the foreign exchange deposit rate, for transactions in which the

2

Central Bank is a counterparty, was reduced to 5.5 percent for US Dollar and to
6.5 percent for Euro.
d. On 5 December 2008, the FX required reserves ratio, which was 11.0 percent,
was reduced by 2.0 percentage points, providing the banking system with an
additional foreign currency liquidity amounting to approximately USD 2.5
billion. In addition, with the new measures that have been taken related to export
rediscount credits, the limit for export rediscount credits has been increased and
the utilization of these credits has been eased.
e. As the depth of the foreign exchange market decreased and unhealthy price
formations were witnessed, foreign exchange selling auctions have been
resumed as of 10 March 2009 to ensure smooth operation of the foreign
exchange market through supporting foreign exchange liquidity. 900 million US
dollar was sold through foreign exchange selling auctions.
6. With the diminishing effects of the global crisis, some of the measures related to the
foreign exchange market have already been removed. The foreign exchange selling
auctions were suspended on 2 April 2009, as concerns pertaining to the depth of the
foreign exchange market have been eased with the effect of favorable developments in
the global markets. The foreign exchange buying auctions aimed at reserve
accumulation, which were suspended during the crisis period, were resumed as of 4
August 2009 as the risk appetite regained strength with positive expectations related to
the global economy and the foreign exchange market has become relatively stabilized.
7. A significant part of the foreign exchange liquidity measures implemented during the
crisis by the Central Bank are still in effect. Even though the foreign exchange liquidity
of the banking system has been strong, the facilities provided by the Foreign Exchange
Deposit Market within the Central Bank eased concerns during the crisis period and
also facilitated the foreign borrowing transactions of the system, by providing an
important safeguard to the banking system. The Central Bank is the lender of last resort
for Turkish lira and has broad flexibilities related to Turkish lira liquidity management,
however the Central Bank is not naturally the lender of last resort for other currencies.
For this reason, the banking system has to be much more discreet and prudent in its
management of foreign exchange liquidity. The facilities provided by the Central Bank
during the crisis should not result in complacency and the banking system should carry
on with effective foreign exchange liquidity management. Therefore, in the upcoming
period, as normalization in the global markets becomes significant, it is planned that
3

measures related to foreign exchange liquidity will gradually be taken to pre-crisis
levels, in an orderly manner.
8. Even the Central Bank’s exit strategy related to foreign exchange liquidity may change
as needs arise, it is foreseen to be as follows:
a. The FX required reserves ratio may gradually be increased in a measured pace.
b. Considering developments in global interest rates, foreign exchange deposit
lending rates announced by the Central Bank may be increased.
c. After the effects of the developed countries’ exit strategies are monitored, the
intermediary function of the Central Bank in the foreign exchange deposit
market will be abolished. However, banks will be able to borrow foreign
exchange deposits from the Central Bank within the predetermined borrowing
limits. The maturity of the foreign exchange deposits borrowed within the
predetermined borrowing limits by banks from the Central Bank will be
decreased from 3 months to 1 week.
9. On the other hand, even if no change is considered in the current circumstances, the
limits and conditions for export rediscount credits, that are provided to exporters by the
Central Bank through Eximbank, may be revised gradually in case the need for credits
disappear and utilization decreases.

Measures and Exit Strategy for Turkish Lira Markets

10. While evaluating the exit strategy for Turkish lira operations, the nature and purpose of
the Central Bank’s monetary measures, which have been implemented since the
deepening of the global crisis period, should be properly understood. Monetary
measures implemented during crisis could be classified into three main groups:
a. The first pillar of monetary measures was the arrangements to eliminate the
uncertainties in money markets caused by the crisis. Within this framework;
i. In October and November 2008, in order to reduce the potential
volatility in overnight interest rates, the corridor of the Central Bank’s
borrowing and lending interest rates was reduced from 3.5 points to 2.5
points.
ii. After October 2008, to reduce the potential tension in money markets
and to eliminate the volatility in overnight interest rates, the Central
Bank started to inject more liquidity than needed. The excess liquidity
4

created within this context was sterilized by O/N operations at the end of
the day.
b. The second pillar of monetary measures was the arrangements to support the
credit markets by taking the permanent decrease in liquidity levels into account.
Within this framework;
i. On 19 June 2009 in response to the increasing liquidity shortage in the
market and the possibility that the shortage may become permanent, the
Central Bank started 3-month repo auctions.
ii. As the permanence of the liquidity shortage in the market became more
evident, on 16 October 2009, in order to support the credit mechanism,
the Turkish lira required reserve ratio was reduced from 6 percent to 5
percent.
c. The third and last pillar of the monetary measures is monetary policy decisions.
After the crisis began to deepen, as it was predicted that the inflation rate would
decline dramatically, after November 2008 the Central Bank policy interest rates
were sharply reduced and the Central Bank’s borrowing rate was cut from 16.75
percent to 6.50 percent.
11. Also, independent of these measures, due to the technical reasons announced at the
release of the “Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2010”, dated 10 December
2009, the Central Bank started to purchase government securities from the secondary
markets as of 23 December 2009. Although the outright purchase of government
securities coincides with the crisis period, it has no direct relationship with the crisis.
Hence, the outright purchase of government securities should be considered out of the
scope of the exit strategy. In this respect, the outright purchase of government securities
will continue in the framework of the previously announced program.
12. In the formulation of exit strategies, accurate understanding of the nature of the
measures taken during the crisis is important. Some of the measures regarding the
Turkish lira markets aim to eliminate the temporary risks of the crisis and others reflect
the permanent changes emerged with the impact of the crisis. Overfunding of the
markets is an application regarding direct crisis management to prevent fluctuations in
interest rates. Therefore, this issue takes priority within the context of exit strategy. On
the other hand, in the coming period it is foreseen that, the liquidity shortage in the
market will continue and the conditions for technical interest rate adjustment mentioned

5

in the release of the “Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2010” dated 10 December
2009, will arise.
13. Considering the allocation of liquidity within the system in order to prepare the banking
sector for technical rate adjustment, in order to reduce possible fluctuations in the
money markets and to maintain liquidity management flexibility against unforeseen
liquidity developments, the Central Bank decided to keep the integrity of both reducing
overfunding in the context of the exit strategy and technical interest rate adjustment
operations and to adopt a gradual strategy.
14. In the first stage, the amount of liquidity that has been provided as a part of the
overfunding policy will be reduced gradually (Graph 1). In this process, the Central
Bank will begin to determine the amount of funding via repo auctions in such a way
that, at the end of the day there will remain less excess liquidity, so the amount
withdrawn in Repo and Reverse Repo Market of ISE and Interbank Money Market
within the Central Bank will lessen. In this period:
a. As in the current situation, it will be paid attention on to keep the overnight
interest rates about the announced borrowing rate.
b. The overnight borrowing rate announced by the Central Bank will continue to
be the reference rate of the monetary policy.
c. The gradual decline in overfunding may cause quite a limited rise in weekly
repo auction interest rates.

15. In case liquidity shortage evolves in line with expectations, in the second stage, the
technical interest rate adjustment process will become operative. As stated in article 62
of the Central Bank’s announcement published on 10 December 2009 (Monetary Policy
and Exchange Rate Policy For 2010);
“…In such a case, (as a permanent liquidity shortage emerges) the Central Bank,
after considering the distribution of liquidity within the system, may opt for the oneweek maturity repo auction rate to be the monetary policy reference interest rate and
to adjust the overnight lending and borrowing interest rates downward in order to
facilitate this. As elaborated below, a technical interest rate cut will merely imply a
technical arrangement to facilitate a change in operational structure due to the
permanent change in liquidity conditions where short-term interest rates are
maintained at current level. Thus it shall not in any way imply the easing of
monetary policy.”
In article 68 of the same announcement, it is specified that;
“…The Central Bank will also continue its practices to enhance the effectiveness
of monetary policy and liquidity management in 2010. Accordingly, the Central
Bank may change not only its liquidity management strategy, but also the overnight
borrowing and lending interest rate margins when necessary.”
In this respect, the change in the operational structure of liquidity management will not
be in the form of a one time interest rate cut as mentioned in the announcement
published on 10 December 2009. However, in order to maintain the flexibility of
liquidity management against unexpected liquidity developments and not to create
volatility in money markets, it is planned to be carried out in two steps.
16. Thus;
a. In the first step (Graph 2);
i. The Central Bank’s borrowing and lending interest rates for overnight
transactions will not be changed. However, the one-week repo auction
procedure will be subject to change by implementing amount auction
procedure via fixed interest rate instead of the traditional auction
procedure.
ii. In this step, the fixed interest rate for one-week repo auctions will be
determined by adding 50 basis points to the declared overnight borrowing
interest rate of the Central Bank. Therefore, the fixed interest rate for one7

week repo transactions will become the reference (policy) interest rate of
the monetary policy.
iii. For example, if the Central Bank’s overnight borrowing interest rate is 6.5
percent and the lending interest rate is 9.0 percent on the date of this
arrangement, while the Central Bank’s overnight borrowing and lending
rates will be kept at 6.5 and 9.0 percent respectively, the interest rate of
one-week repo auctions will be determined as 7.0 percent, founded by
adding 50 basis points to the overnight borrowing interest rate.
iv. Starting to use the one-week repo auction interest rate rather than the
overnight borrowing interest rate, as the policy interest rate will not mean
a change in monetary policy stance. Indeed, the one-week repo auction
interest rates are already being formed above the announced borrowing
rate for overnight transactions.
v. In this transition period, although in a relatively decreasing amount, the
excess funding policy to the market will continue. While determining the
funding amount through repo auctions, it will be considered that the
overnight interest rates to be formed generally about the declared
borrowing interest rate. In occasional cases of volatility, it will be paid
attention that the overnight rates do not exceed the one week repo auction
rate evidently.

b. As the liquidity shortage increases in line with expectations, the second step of
the technical interest rate adjustment process will become operational. In the
second step (Graphics 3);
i. The difference between the one-week repo auction interest rate and the
overnight borrowing interest rate may be increased. The secondary market
average overnight interest rate will be targeted to be formed around the
one week repo auction rate.
ii. The difference between the one-week repo auction interest rate and the
overnight borrowing interest rate may be increased; either by raising the
one-week repo auction interest rate if the Monetary Policy Committee
(Committee) decides that monetary tightening is required, or by lowering
the overnight borrowing and lending interest rates if the Committee
decides not to make any change in the policy interest rate.
iii. In this term, the differences between the one-week repo auction interest
rate and the overnight borrowing and lending interest rates may not always
be symmetrical. The Committee will determine the difference between the
borrowing and lending rates, and the difference between the said rates and
the one-week repo auction rate as an element of the operational framework
of monetary policy.

17. Of the measures taken since the last quarter of 2008 such as the initiation of 3 month
repo auctions and the reduction of the Turkish lira required reserves ratio aimed to
support effective functioning of the credit mechanism. During the global crisis, all
around the world capital flows slowed down due to weakening capital flows, thus a
permanent liquidity shortage emerged in our country. As long as the liquidity shortage
continues at high levels, although the amount may change depending on the liquidity
level, three-month repo auctions will continue to be a regular funding instrument.
However, as no change is foreseen currently, if the liquidity shortage decreases
noticeably and/or credit conditions ease, the Turkish lira required reserve ratios may be
increased as well.
18. Although the rapid interest rate cut decisions taken by the Central Bank aimed partly to
eliminate the negative effects of the global crisis on the corporate sector and the
tightening in monetary conditions, the decisions are fundamentally shaped by the
inflation outlook and the decline in the risk premium of Turkey. In other words, the
policy interest rate cuts reflect the adaptation process for interest rates to levels that are
compatible with price stability. In the coming period, the short-term interest rates will
be determined with a view to harmonizing the inflation outlook with the medium term
inflation targets.
19. The main policy instrument of the Central Bank is the short-term interest rates.
However, one of the lessons learned during the crisis is that other monetary policy
instruments may be required to reduce the macroeconomic risks, especially when the
economy is overheated. In this context, depending on future developments, – for
example if the credit expansion speed exceeds desired levels – the required reserve
ratios may be used more actively as a policy tool to reduce the macroeconomic risks.
20. As a result, some of the measures taken in the foreign exchange and Turkish lira
markets during the crisis are planned to be withdrawn gradually. In this context,
primarily the measures taken in direct crisis management will be withdrawn, and as in
the rest of the world, in our country the exit strategy will be a cautious and gradual
process that safeguards financial stability.
21. On the other hand, the release of the “Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2010”
dated 10 December 2009, continues to be the main policy document regarding exchange
rate policy and liquidity management issues. Henceforth, regarding issues that are not

10

clarified in this release, the statements in the release dated 10 December 2009 will
continue to be valid.
