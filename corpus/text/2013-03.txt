With the increase in Turkish lira reserve requirement ratios, Turkish lira
required reserves will increase by approximately TL 1.4 billion. Under the assumption
that the ROM facilities continue to be used at current levels, liquidity amounting to
about TL 300 million, FX worth USD 750 million and gold worth USD 350 million will
be withdrawn from the market and the effective reserve requirement ratio for Turkish
lira currently standing at 10.6 percent will become 10.8 percent.
With the increase in FX reserve requirement ratios, liquidity amounting to about
USD 900 million will be withdrawn from the market and the effective reserve
requirement ratio for FX currently standing at 10.6 percent will become 11 percent.
Reserve requirement ratios will be effective as of the calculation period dated 1
February 2013 and the maintenance period will begin on 15 February 2013.
Moreover, the reserve option coefficients have been raised by 0.1 points for all
tranches of gold reserves held for Turkish lira required reserves. Banks have been
consistently using the facility and the utilization ratio is at 82.6 percent. At present, 237
tons of gold worth USD 12.7 billion are being held for Turkish lira required reserves.
Should this facility continue to be used at the same level, the expected increase in
Central Bank gold reserves is approximately 16.5 tons of gold worth USD 900 million.
Revisions in the ROCs for gold reserves held for Turkish lira required reserves
will be effective as of the calculation period dated 15 February 2013 and the
maintenance period will begin on 1 March 2013.
