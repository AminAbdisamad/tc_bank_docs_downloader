required reserves will increase by approximately TL  1.4 billion. Under the assumption 
that the ROM facilities continue to be used at curr ent levels, liquidity amounting to 
about TL 300 million, FX worth USD 750 million and gold worth USD 350 million will 
be withdrawn from the market and the effective rese rve requirement ratio for Turkish 
lira currently standing at 10.6 percent will become  10.8 percent.   
With the increase in FX reserve requirement ratios,  liquidity amounting to about 
USD 900 million will be withdrawn from the market a nd the effective reserve 
requirement ratio for FX currently standing at 10.6  percent will become 11 percent.   
Reserve requirement ratios will be effective as of the calculation period dated 1 
February 2013 and the maintenance period will begin  on 15 February 2013. 
Moreover, the reserve option coefficients have been  raised by 0.1 points for all 
tranches of gold reserves held for Turkish lira req uired reserves. Banks have been 
consistently using the facility and the utilization  ratio is at 82.6 percent. At present, 237 
tons of gold worth USD 12.7 billion are being held for Turkish lira required reserves. 
Should this facility continue to be used at the sam e level, the expected increase in 
Central Bank gold reserves is approximately 16.5 to ns of gold worth USD 900 million. 
Revisions in the ROCs for gold reserves held for Tu rkish lira required reserves 
will be effective as of the calculation period date d 15 February 2013 and the 
maintenance period will begin on 1 March 2013.
