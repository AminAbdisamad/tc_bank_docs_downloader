DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Meeting Date: December 18, 2012
Participating Committee Members
Erdem Başçı (Governor), Ahmet Faruk Aysan, Murat Çetinkaya, Necati Şahin, Abdullah Yavaş,
Mehmet Yörükoğlu. Absent: Turalay Kenç (on duty).

The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to adjust the short term
interest rates as follows:
a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) has been cut from 5.75 percent to 5.5 percent.
b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate has been kept at 5 percent while lending
rate has been kept at 9 percent. Interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary
dealers via repo transactions has been kept at 8.5 percent.
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing
rate has been kept at 0 percent while lending rate has been kept at 12 percent.
Recent data confirm that the rebalancing between the domestic and external demand
continues as envisaged. Domestic demand follows a moderate pace while exports continue to
increase despite weakening global activity. Overall, aggregate demand conditions support
disinflation and current account deficit continues to decline gradually.
Confidence indices and credit growth show a marked increase, supported by the
accommodative liquidity policies implemented by the Central Bank since mid-year and the
relative improvement in the risk appetite. Therefore, the contribution of domestic demand to
economic growth is expected to increase in the forthcoming period.
The Committee expects that year-end inflation will be significantly lower than the
forecast presented in the October Inflation Report, owing to the favorable course of
unprocessed food prices. However, indirect effects of recent increases in administered and
energy prices are closely monitored in terms of the medium term inflation outlook.
The Committee has stated that, in order to contain the risks on financial stability in the
face of accelerating capital inflows, the proper policy would be to keep interest rates at low
levels while continuing with macroprudential measures. Accordingly, the Committee has
indicated that, in order to support financial stability, it would be appropriate to take additional
steps using reserve requirements, while delivering a limited cut in the policy rate. In the
following period, if deemed necessary for financial stability, a measured adjustment in the
interest rate corridor might also be considered.
Ongoing uncertainties regarding the global economy necessitate the monetary policy to
remain flexible in both directions. Therefore, the impact of the measures undertaken on credit,
domestic demand, and inflation expectations will be monitored closely and the funding amount
will be adjusted in either direction, as needed.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to
revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five
working days.
