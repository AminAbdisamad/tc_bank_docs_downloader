The Monetary Policy Committee has decided to keep short-term interest rates
(policy rates) unchanged at the CBRT Interbank Money Market and the Istanbul
Stock Exchange Repo-Reverse Repo Market as follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: The CBRT borrowing interest rate is 13.25
percent, and the CBRT lending interest rate is 16.25 percent.
b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Within the framework of the Late
Liquidity Window Facility, the CBRT overnight borrowing interest rate applicable
between 4:00 p.m. – 4:30 p.m. at Interbank Money Market is 9.25 percent. Lending
interest rate is 19.25 percent.
c) The interest rates applicable to overnight and one-week maturity borrowing
facilities provided for primary dealer banks via repo transactions within the
framework of open market transactions are 15.25 percent.
The Committee perceives that the latest incoming data about output, demand
and inflation are largely consistent with the medium-term outlook elaborated in the
Inflation Report, putting aside the recent volatility in financial markets. Despite the
rise in inflation during the first four months of 2006, the rate of increase in the index,
including April, which is calculated by excluding items such as alcoholic beveragestobacco, energy, gold and unprocessed food that are beyond the control of monetary
policy, remains steady at low levels. However, after the recent financial turbulences, it
has become more likely that inflation might realize above the 2006 year-end inflation
target.
The Central Bank will surely respond if there are strong indications that the
inflation could considerably deviate from the targets in the medium-term. In light of
available information, it should be noted that, although it is still early to change the
medium-term outlook, the policy rates are less likely to decrease in the short-term. In
the coming period, the policy rate decisions will be conditional on the international
liquidity conditions, changes in risk premiums and other developments. The direction
and magnitude of policy response can vary depending on whether the effects of
fluctuations are temporary or permanent.
It should be emphasized that any new data and information associated with the
inflation outlook will potentially lead the Monetary Policy Committee to revise its
future stance.
A broader summary of the assessments of the Monetary Policy Committee
will be published on Friday, 26th May 2006.
