The Monetary Policy Committee has decided  to  keep  short-term interest rates 
(policy rates)  unchanged at the CBRT Interbank Money Market and the Istanbul 
Stock Exchange Repo-Reverse Repo Market as follows:  
a) Overnight Interest Rates:  The CBRT borrowing interest rate is 13.25  
percent, and the CBRT lending interest rate is 16.25  percent.  
b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates:  Within the framework of the Late 
Liquidity Window Facility, the CBRT overnight borrowing interest rat e applicable 
between 4:00 p.m. – 4:30 p.m. at Interbank Money Market is 9.25  percent. Lending 
interest rate is 19.25 percent. 
c) The interest rates applicable to overnight and one-week maturity  borrowing 
facilities provided for primary dealer banks via repo transactions w ithin the 
framework of open market transactions are 15.25 percent. 
The Committee perceives that the latest incoming data about output, de mand 
and inflation are largely consistent with the medium-term outlook el aborated in the 
Inflation Report, putting aside the recent volatility in financial m arkets. Despite the 
rise in inflation during the first four months of 2006, the rate of incre ase in the index, 
including April, which is calculated by excluding items such as alc oholic beverages-
tobacco, energy, gold and unprocessed food that are beyond the control of monetar y 
policy, remains steady at low levels. However, after the recent financial turbulences, it 
has become more likely that inflation might realize above the 2006 ye ar-end inflation 
target.   
The Central Bank will surely respond if there are strong indicati ons that the 
inflation could considerably deviate from the targets in the medium-t erm. In light of 
available information, it should be noted that, although it is still ear ly to change the 
medium-term outlook, the policy rates are less likely to decrease  in the short-term. In 
the coming period, the policy rate decisions will be conditional on the i nternational 
liquidity conditions, changes in risk premiums and other developments. The dir ection 
and magnitude of policy response can vary depending on whether the effects  of 
fluctuations are temporary or permanent. 
It should be emphasized that any new data and information associated wi th the 
inflation outlook will potentially lead the Monetary Policy Committe e to revise its 
future stance. 
 A broader summary of the assessments of the Monetary Policy Com mittee 
will be published on Friday, 26 th  May 2006.
