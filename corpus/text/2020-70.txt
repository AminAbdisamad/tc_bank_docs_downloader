Summary of the Monetary Policy
Committee Meeting
26 November 2020, No: 2020-70
Meeting Date: 19 November 2020

Inflation Developments
1.

In October, consumer prices rose by 2.13%, while annual inflation increased by 0.14 points to
11.89%. Annual inflation increased in food and core goods groups, while it decreased in the
energy group and remained flat in the services group. While the rise in food inflation
stemmed from both unprocessed and processed food prices, the rise in core goods inflation
was mainly driven by durable goods. Annual energy inflation decreased owing to the base
effect in electricity prices. Against this background, while annual inflation in B and C indices
increased, the trend of the B index remained almost flat and the trend of the C index slightly
decreased.

2.

In October, annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 1.56 points to
16.51%. Due to the rally in international food prices and exchange rate developments, annual
inflation in unprocessed food group increased by 1.31 points to 18.78% and that of
processed food prices increased by 1.70 points to 14.49%. Eggs, pulses and rice played a
major role in the increase in unprocessed food prices. In the processed food group, prices of
bread and cereals as well as other processed foods posted high monthly increases. The
adverse outlook in the latter was mainly driven by fats and oils.

3.

Energy prices increased by 2.09% in October, yet annual inflation in the energy group
decreased by 2.79 points to 3.88%. In this period, although electricity prices rose by 5.76%,
annual inflation in the group decreased owing to the base effect. In October, international oil
prices posted a limited decrease; however, depreciation of the Turkish lira led to a rise in
fuel-oil prices and curbed a more favorable outlook in the energy group inflation.

4.

In October, prices of core goods increased by 3.29% and groupâ€™s annual inflation rose by 0.41
points to 12.09%. Owing to exchange rate developments and the lagged effects of the strong
credit impulse, the uptrend in the annual inflation in durable goods group continued, led by
furniture, automobiles and white goods, and increased by 2.41 points to 19.79%. Meanwhile,
monthly and annual inflation in the clothing and footwear remained weak also due to the
sectoral demand conditions. In other core goods, although annual inflation remained
relatively low at 9.40%, the effects of exchange rate developments have been observed in
monthly price increases.

5.

Services prices was up 0.71 percent in October and annual inflation in the group rose by 0.08
points to 10.92%. Annual inflation decreased in communication and transport services, while
it increased in restaurants-hotels, rents and other services. Other services group prices were
1

affected by exchange rate developments, meanwhile, maintenance and repair of personal
transport equipment as well as health services continued to be the most prominent items.
While price increases in communication and transport services were moderate, annual
inflation in communication decreased on the back of the base effect.
6.

In November, the rise in inflation expectations continued. The year-end inflation expectation
increased by 71 basis points to 12.47%; the 12-month-ahead inflation expectation increased
by 24 basis points to 10.77%, and the 24-month-ahead inflation expectation increased by 15
basis points to 9.20%.

Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks
7.

Global economic activity has recovered partially in the third quarter. However, uncertainties
regarding global economic activity heightened due to the recent increases in Covid-19 cases.
The recently elevated pandemic-related restrictions in the European countries keep
downside risks to external demand and export outlook in place. Moreover, uncertainties
remain regarding the possible effects of the pandemic and health measures on consumption
habits and general spending behavior. In case of prolonged normalization due to delays in
widespread vaccination, the recovery in the global activity may be slow and the global risk
appetite may fluctuate.

8.

Although crude oil prices are still below the pre-pandemic period levels, they have risen since
the previous MPC Meeting. Besides, the upward trend in commodity prices excluding energy,
specifically industrial metals and agricultural commodities, increases the upward cost
pressure on consumer inflation. Developments in international prices as well as the exchange
rate have an adverse effect on the trend inflation, particularly in food and core goods groups.

9.

Advanced and emerging economies maintain their expansionary monetary and fiscal stances.
While long-term interest rates remain at historic lows across advanced economies, both
central bank statements and market expectations suggest that the low interest rate
environment is likely to continue for a long period. The effectiveness of these policies on
financial markets, growth and employment will depend on the course of the pandemic and
the available policy room in each country.

10. Portfolio inflows to emerging economies have continued at an increasing scale since the
previous MPC meeting due to improved risk sentiment. However, excluding China, inflows to
bond markets increased at a limited extent, while those to equity markets remained
relatively weak. Reinforced perceptions that policy rates will remain low in advanced
economies and possible incentive packages are likely to improve portfolio flows to emerging
economies in the upcoming period.
11. Domestic economic activity posted a marked recovery in the third quarter. According to
September data, industrial production index increased by 1.7% month-on-month and by
30.3% quarter-on-quarter, exceeding its pre-pandemic levels. Considering together with the
developments in turnover indices, economic activity recovered with a wide sectoral diffusion
led by sectors sensitive to financing conditions and those producing goods for the domestic
market. Nevertheless, the weak trend continued in goods and services sectors strongly tied
to the tourism sector.
12. The recovery in economic activity continues. However, leading indicators and high-frequency
data suggest that economic activity has been decelerating since mid-October. Recently,
exports slowed down due to pandemic-driven limitations in Europe while domestic demand
remained relatively strong. Meanwhile, partial restrictions introduced due to the increasing
2

number of cases heighten uncertainties on the short-run outlook of economic activity,
particularly the services sector.
13. Strengthening domestic demand due to the lagged effects of strong credit impulse during
the pandemic, affects the current account balance adversely through the imports channel. In
November, imports excluding gold remains almost flat, while imports of gold has still been
strong, despite some slowdown. On the other hand, the restraining effects of pandemicrelated measures introduced in Europe have started to be observed; however, since
measures are not as tight as those introduced at the early stages of the pandemic and the
activity in manufacturing industry continues, the favorable outlook particularly in exports of
intermediary goods is maintained. The Committee underscored the importance of the course
of the current account balance in terms of a lasting recovery in economic activity and
financial stability.
14. The recovery in economic activity has a positive effect on the labor market. In August, nonfarm employment increased across sectors, while so far, employment losses have been
partially compensated. In this period, both the labor force participation rate posted an
increase on the back of economic recovery and unemployment rates receded. Leading
indicators reveal that new job posts increased and employment opportunities continued to
improve.

Monetary Policy
15. The Committee emphasized that, within the inflation targeting framework, it will decisively
use all of its policy tools in order to achieve and maintain price stability, by taking into
account all factors affecting inflation and the increased risks.
16. The lagged effects of depreciation in Turkish lira, increasing international commodity prices
and deterioration in inflation expectations affect the inflation outlook adversely. While
tracked data for November point to an increase in inflation due to the recent exchange rate
volatility, this is assessed to be temporary with the decisive monetary policy stance.
Accordingly, the Committee has decided to implement a transparent and strong monetary
tightening in order to eliminate risks to the inflation outlook, contain inflation expectations
and restore the disinflation process. In this context, the one-week repo auction interest rate,
which is the policy rate, is increased from 10.25 percent to 15 percent. In the periods ahead,
all factors affecting inflation will be taken into account, and tightness of monetary policy will
be decisively sustained until a permanent fall in inflation is achieved. The Central Bank will
continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability
objectives.
17. In addition to monetary tightening, the Committee decided to adopt a simple operational
framework to enhance transparency and predictability, and decided to provide all funding at
the one-week repo auction rate, which is the main policy rate. In this regard, the funding
currently provided by the CBRT via traditional method repo auctions with one-month
maturity and late liquidity window facilities will instead be provided via one-week quantity
repo auctions, which is the principal monetary policy tool as of 20 November 2020.
18. In line with the primary objective of price stability, the Committee assessed the need for a
revision in the reserve requirement policy in order to enhance the effectiveness of monetary
transmission mechanism.

19. Recently, positive expectations regarding monetary policy have been contributing to the
decline in the country risk premium. The Committee assessed that the permanent
establishment of a low inflation environment will affect macroeconomic and financial
stability positively through the fall in country risk premium, reversal in the dollarization
trend, accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and the perpetual decline in financing
costs.
20. In order to achieve price stability, a strong policy coordination and an integrated macro
policy mix involving all stakeholders are required.
21. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise
its stance.
