Press Release on Rediscount Credits
In order to expand the utilization of the CBRT’s rediscount credit facility and increase
the contribution of rediscount credits to the CBRT’s foreign exchange reserves, the
arrangements below have been made:
• The overall limit of rediscount credits has been increased from USD 17 billion
to USD 20 billion.
• Of this total amount, USD 17 billion has been allocated to Export Credit Bank
of Turkey, Inc. (Türk Eximbank) and USD 3 billion to commercial banks.
• In line with the increased overall limit for rediscount credits, the credit limit
per company for Foreign Trade Capital Companies has been raised from USD
300 million to USD 400 million and for other companies, from USD 250 million
