No: 2002/42

May 23, 2002

PRESS RELEASE
Starting from 24.5.2002, the interest rate applicable to TL
required reserves is changed to 22%. The interest rate to be
paid on FX required reserves is determined as 0.84 % for USD
and 1.58 % for Euro.
While banks were required to maintain required reserves only for their
deposits according to the repealed Communique No: 96/1 on Required Reserves,
the base for required reserves has been extended with Communique No: 2002/1.
According to this, banks shall maintain required reserves for their other
liabilities along with their deposits starting from 24.5.2002. Following these
amendments, the amount of TL required reserves on which Central Bank pays
interest, shall approximately increase by 55%.
As it is known, interest rate on TL required reserves maintained by the
banks at the Central Bank has been applied as 40% since 8.8.2001. This rate
applied to the previous base becomes approximately equivalent to 26% when the
new base is taken into consideration. The current interest rate is determined to
be 22% starting from 24.5.2002, by considering the decrease in interest rates
on deposits and enlargement of the base for required reserves. It is possible
that this rate will be revised in line with developments in interest rates on
deposits.
The interest rates applicable on FX required reserves shall be equivalent
to interest rate on 2 days-notice FX deposits and determined on a weekly basis.
The rates are set as 0.84% for USD and 1.58% for Euro to be applicable
between 24.5.2002-26.5.2002.
Interest on TL and FX required reserves shall accrue as of March, June,
September and December as before. The interest rate on TL required reserves
shall be announced when it is re-determined in line with the developments in
interest rates on deposits and the rates on FX required reserves to be
determined weekly shall be announced on the first day of each week.
