PRESS RELEASE  
ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE INTERVENTION  
OF THE CENTRAL BANK  
 
The Central Bank has announced through several press releases that, under the 
floating exchange rate regime the level of exchange rate is determined by supply and 
demand conditions in the currency markets, the volatility in the exchange rate is closely 
observed by the Central Bank, and the Central Bank may directly intervene in the markets 
in the event of an excessive volatility that  might occur in either directions. In this 
framework, the Central Bank directly intervened in the markets by buying foreign 
currency on 27 January 2005 due to excessive volatility in exchange rates.  
 The recently observed foreign exchange sales arising fr om the increasingly 
optimistic expectations about the Turkish economy have led to the excessive volatility in 
exchange rates. Therefore, the Central Bank has decided to intervene in the markets by 
buying foreign currency in order to prevent this volatility .
