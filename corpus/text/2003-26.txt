PRESS RELEASE 
ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE INTERVENTION 
OF THE CENTRAL BANK 
 
The Central Bank has announced through several pres s releases that, under the 
floating exchange rate regime, the level of exchang e rate is determined by supply and 
demand conditions in the currency markets, the vola tility in the exchange rate is 
closely observed by the Central Bank, and the Centr al Bank may directly intervene in 
the markets in the event of an excessive volatility  that might occur in both directions. 
In this regard, the Central Bank intervened directl y in the foreign exchange markets on 
12th and 21 st  May 2003 as a result of the excessive volatility i n exchange rates. 
However, besides lack of demand for foreign exchang e observed lately, the 
relatively low level of Turkish lira liquidity in m arket and the expectation that this 
situation could persist depending on this weekâ€™s Tr easury auction results have 
increased the foreign exchange selling by giving ri se to excessive volatility in 
exchange rates. Therefore, the Central Bank directl y intervened in the foreign 
exchange market today by buying foreign currency in  order to prevent excessive 
volatility.
