THE CBRT PRESS RELEASE ON  
THE SUSPENSION OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE SELLING AUCTIONS   
 
 
As known, in response to the recent unhealthy price  formation due to a 
decrease in the depth of the foreign exchange marke t, the Central Bank of the 
Republic of Turkey (CBRT) started holding foreign e xchange selling auctions 
beginning from 24 October 2008. The daily amount of  the auctions was set as USD 
50 million and USD 100 million have been sold in to tal in the two auctions held so far.    
It has been observed that the recent favorable deve lopments in global markets 
have eased the concerns pertaining to the depth of the foreign exchange market. 
Therefore, the CBRT has decided to suspend the fore ign exchange selling auctions 
to be effective as of today; however, the auctions may be resumed if deemed 
necessary.
