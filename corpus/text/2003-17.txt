PRESS RELEASE
ON THE CBRT INTEREST RATE CUTS

I. GENERAL EVALUATION
1. Starting from November 2002, the Central Bank of Turkey has underlined three
crucial risk factors that may have a negative impact on inflation in 2003, and pursued a
cautious strategy while setting interest rates in the light of these risks. These risks are
listed as (i) the upsurge in domestic demand beyond predictions in line with the improvement
in expectations, (ii) the increase in agriculture and food prices owing to seasonal conditions,
(iii) the likelihood of increased production costs due to the pressure exerted by Iraqi war on
oil prices and exchange rates. It has also been pointed out that if fiscal discipline and
structural reforms were followed without any disruption, exogenous shocks to be created by
Iraqi issue might have led to temporary rises in inflation.
2. The Central Bank stressed especially in its press release of March 11, 2003 that
the future course of inflation would basically depend on two factors. The first one was
economic fundamentals and the second one was the possible impact of Iraqi developments on
our country. Moreover, the period starting from the date of the said announcement up until
the end of Iraqi issue was called “extraordinary period.”
3. In the said announcement it was also underlined that economic fundamentals had been
reinforced with the extra measures taken in the framework of the 2003 budget, and with
the ongoing monetary discipline. It was clear that the downward trend in inflation would
continue also after the “extraordinary period” provided that the economic program was
strictly implemented.
4. Furthermore, it was pointed out that there might be some deviations from the main
trend during the “extraordinary period” depending on the outcome of Iraqi crisis and if so,
this deviation would only be temporary. In fact, the inflationary course is affected by
monetary and fiscal discipline, and the environment of confidence created by this discipline
and the optimistic expectations ensued thereafter. It was added that the measures taken
represented a tight discipline, and the environment of confidence would expand thanks to
strict implementations and thus, the impacts of an exogenous shock such as Iraqi crisis would
almost certainly remain as a temporary deviation from the basic trend.

5. It will not be wrong to assume that the Iraqi issue has been settled with respect to
inflationary analysis, and accordingly the extraordinary period has come to an end. During
this period, the inflationary pressure exerted by the cost elements, which emerged
especially due to fluctuations in crude oil prices and exchange rates, has now disappeared.
Although not considerable, some delayed effects of these movements on prices may later be
felt to some extent. On the other hand, according to the current indicators, domestic
demand is not expected to exert a significant pressure on inflation at least in the shortterm.
6. The Iraqi issue was not the sole reason that led to a deviation, albeit slight, from
the main trend of inflation in the first quarter of 2003. There is no doubt that the price
increases in agriculture and food products at considerably high levels owing to the weather
conditions, and the public price adjustments, which were postponed due to elections, played
significant role in this deviation as well. Another impact in the same direction is the “base”
effect that was also emphasized in our announcement of March 11, 2003. As is known, two
distinct movements were observed around the main downward trend in the 2002 inflation.
Although de-seasonalized inflation rates pursued a relatively low course until June, an
adverse trend was observed in the rest of 2002. Therefore, even if the said temporary
factors did not happen, a significant drop in annual inflation rates in the first half of 2003
was not expected by the Central Bank because of the “base” effect.
7. Undoubtedly, the Central Bank, whose primary objective is price stability, does not
make its short-term interest rate decisions in accordance with the temporary movements in
inflation that may occur due to exogenous shocks and weather conditions The most important
point with respect to our policies is the future trend of inflation, and whether the inflation
target will be achieved or not.
8. The 2003 Budget, which was approved by the Turkish Parliament and put into force,
is a drastic step that shows the determination of sustained fiscal discipline. Conclusion of
the suspended fourth review, which was conducted with the IMF, was another development
that dispelled the worries of economic agents on the implementation of the program in
recent months. Furthermore, the budget performance and the realizations of some measures
taken for establishing fiscal discipline are favorable.
9. Considering the significant drop in the 2002 inflation thanks to the current
program, and the developments mentioned above, which signifies a clear expression of intent
to continue with this successful program with determination, the Central Bank maintains a
cautious optimism over the inflation for the next period. Continuation of this optimism and
without making reference to adjective “cautious” will certainly depend on the implementation
of the program with the same determination.

II. THE CENTRAL BANK INTEREST RATES
