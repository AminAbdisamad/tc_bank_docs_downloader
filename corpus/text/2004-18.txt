3. The six-month average of seasonally adjusted inflation became 0.9 percent in WPI and 0.6
percent in CPI. Annualized figures correspond to 11i.3 percent and 7.4 percent, respectively.
During the same period, the average rate of increase in seasonally adjusted CPI excluding food

realized as 0.89 percent. This figure corresponds to 11.2 percent in annual terms (Figure 1).

Developments in Consumer Prices

4. The downward trend in CPI inflattıon maintained its modest course in view of favorable cost
conditions and positive expectations, and followed a path consistent with the end-year target of
12 percent in the first guarter of the year. However, the rate of increase in the prices of subgroups, influenced by tax adjustments made in the supplementary budget, remained relatively

above the general trend.

5. In March, the highest price increases were recorded in the food-alcoholic beverages-tobacco
group and in the transportation group. The private consumption tax increases on tobacco and
alcoholic beverages led to a 3.1 percent rise in the food-alcoholic beverages-tobacco group. On
the other hand, the food prices excluding items mentioned above, maintained its downward trend
of the first two months of 2004 with a 2.2 percent increase (zero percent in seasonally adjusted
terms) in March. On the other hand, the price increase in the transportation group remained
above the general increase in CPI and realized as 1i.4 percent due to the 4 percent increase in

personal vehicle repairs.

6. Rent increases in March were limited to 0.8 percent. The slowdown in rent increases may be
considered as a positive development. House repair and maintenance —one of the sub-items of
housing sector-, other expenditures for housing, and electric, gas and other fuel prices decreased
by 1.7 percent, 0.3 percent and 0.1İ percent, respectively. In an environment where CPI increases
by 2.2 percent and CPI excluding food increases by 1.3 percent in January-March period, the 4.4
percent increase of rents shows the necessity of monitoring the rent increases more closely in the

next period as well. On the other hand, the seasonally adjusted rate of increase in the services

02:01 02:04 02:07 02:10 3:01 03:04 3:07 03:10 04:01

group remained closer to its recent trend and realized as 1.4 percent. In this context, the

downward rigidity in services group price increases seems to continue.

7. The positive developments in March include the decline in the prices of pharmaceuticals as a
conseguence of VAT adjustments and exchange rate developments, and the 2.1İ percent decline in
clothing prices. Historicalliy, March is a period when the prices in clothing group increase at least
slightliy before entering a new season. The decline in March 2004 points out that the inflation

trend is considerabily low, and there is no cost-push pressure on prices.

8. Seasonally adjusted CPI increased by 1.1 percent, 0.2 point above that of February. However,
it should be noted that one-off tax increases affected the price developments in March. Despite

these increases, inflation maintained its downward trend.

Developments in Wholesale Prices

9 In March 2004, WPI increased by 2.1İ percent. The rate of increase in seasonally adjusted WPI
rose by 0.4 point compared to February and became 1.5 percent. On the other hand, WPI
inflation excluding agriculture reached the highest rate observed in this group since March 2003

and realized as 1.6 percent (Figure 4).

10. The greatest contribution to WPI increases in March was made by the manufacturing industry
prices with a 1.8 percent rise. In addition to this, agriculture prices contribute 0.8 point to March
WPI inflation with a 3.6 percent increase on a monthiy basis. The seasonally adjusted rate of

increase in agriculture prices rose by 0.3 point compared to February and realized as 1.5 percent.

1i. The monthliy rate of increase in WPI excluding agriculture resulted mainiy from the public
manufacturing industry prices. Despite the 11 percent decline in the average US Dollar rate during
the last four months, public manufacturing industry prices increased by 4.1 percent in March. This
was due to tax İncreases on tobacco products, brought about as a supplementary budget
measure, and the rise in the international prices of the raw materials used as primary inputs in

basic metal and oil products manufacturing sectors.

12. As of end-March, electric-water-gas prices decreased by 0.1 percent on a monthiy basis and
0.5 percent on annual basis. It is especially remarkable that the water prices controlled by local
governments displayed a 4.8 percent decline in January-March period. At this point, the course of

natural gas and water prices gains importance for April and following months.
13. Despite remaining below the public manufacturing industry increase, rate of price increase in
private manufacturing industry realized as 0.7 percent, 0.6 point above the February figure. The 3
percent increase in the prices of food and beverages manufacturing sector was the main

determinant of this rise.

14. In line with the developments mentioned above, annual WPI inflation and WPI inflation
excluding agriculture declined to 8 percent and 5 percent, respectively. High rates of increases in
the first three months of 2003 owing to the developments in the Iragi War have played a role in

stimulating the drop in annual inflation figures of March 2004 as well.
2. OUTLOOK

15. While the favorable outlook in CPI inflation continued in March, a relative acceleration was
observed in WPI inflation increases. Since the initiation of implicit inflation targeting regime, the
end-year inflation target has been defined in terms of consumer prices. Besides, the CPI inflation
has been given emphasis in “Outlook” section of our announcements and reports, whereas WPl
inflation has been evaluated in the light of data on future CPI inflation. Given the aforementioned
developments, it will be useful to interpret the developments in wholesale prices in March in terms

of CPI inflation for the coming period.

16. The 0.5 percent drop in energy prices within WPI on an annual basis, continued to restrict
cost-push inflation pressures. In March, WPI was adversely affected by agriculture prices and the
public price increases due to budgetary measures. The effects of relatively high increase in
agriculture prices on food prices in CPI were limited. Moreover, in the short run it is expected that
high rate of increases in agricultural sector prices will be followed by negligible rate of increase or
decline. Indirect effects of high rate of increase in prices in tobacco manufacturing industry, in
WPI, will be negligible. However, the fact that the increase in WPI mainily stems from oil products
and basic metal industry sectors, as well as the probable persistence of these increases indicate
that inflation will likely be determined by cost-push pressures in general in the following months.
Rises in international metal prices result from increase in demand of China, which is not
considered to be transitory. Likewise, the upward trend in oil prices is not expected to reverse
substantiallıy for some time. Nevertheless, under the fundamental assumptions that relative
stability in foreign exchange rates would continue and that domestic demand would be kept under
control, these developments are not considered as a threat to 2004 inflation yet. Undoubtediy,

these predictions are conditional on fiscal discipline.

17. In general, the belief that the end-year inflation target is achievable is getting stronger as of
the first guarter of 2004. The cumulative CPI inflation and CPI inflation excluding food in the first
guarter of the year became as 2.2 percent and İ.3 percent, respectively. These figures point out
an inflation course consistent with the end-year target, which should be perceived as a favorable
development. However, it should be kept in mind that the Central Bank focuses on likely course of
future inflation, hence gives emphasis not only on the realized inflation figures, but also on the
prospective course of inflation that can be judged from these realisations. In this context, the
relative price dispersion between services group and goods group, and the global rise in prices of

basic metal and oil are considered as risks for future inflation.

18. The drop in annual price increases in services from 22 percent of February to 19.7 percent in
March can be regarded as a favorable development. However, the rate of increase in service
prices in the last guarter, corresponding to İ.1İ percent of the seasonally adjusted average price

increases (14.6 percent in annual terms) is still inconsistent with the end-year target. Although
the slowdown in rent increases, öone of the sub-items of services group, May be considered as a
favorable development, close monitoring of developments in rent is warranted to ascertain
whether such downward trend is permanent or not. Moreover, hospital services prices produced a
less rosy picture, increasing by 13.0 percent during the January-March period. Adjusting health
services prices in line with inflation target, as it is in other economic units, will contribute to the

efforts of breaking the downward rigidity in inflation.

19. In 2004, it is predicted that the recovery in domestic demand will continue in a controlled
manner and that economic growth would be based on investment and consumption as in 2003.
Besides, low unit costs and favorable inflation expectations are expected to continue to support
the downward trend in inflation. Moreover, recent increases in credits extended to Small and
Medium-Sized Enterprises (SME) and in consumer credits will likely maintain their upward course
for sometime. However, modest capacity utilization ratios in the automobile sector, to which
consumer credits are mostly directed, are not yet in a position to push production capacity, and
part of consumption stems from relatively low prices in these sectors. Therefore, it is not expected
that a demand-push inflation pressure should build up in the short-term. On the other hand, it is
considered that the credits extended to private sector will support investment, increasing the

potential output, and ease inflationary pressures.

20. Nevertheless for the sake of financial stability, financial standings of banks should be strong,
and their profitability should be maintained. At a time when inflation is in a downward trend and
interest rate margins are shrinking, banks should try to reduce their costs and should focus on risk
management in extending loans. While trying to recuperate their reduced interest rate margins by
increasing their market shares and enlarging their customer base, banks should pay attention to
interest rate and credit risks. Moreover, although consumer credit interest rates are declining
rapidiy, they are still at high levels considering the targeted inflation rates. At a time when no
sharp increase is expected in real incomes, household tendency to finance consumption spending
via consumer credits still bearing high real interest rates compared to the realized inflation, or
higher compared inflation target, cannot be regarded as rational behavior. Despite the fact that
the rise in consumer credits have not created a significant inflationary pressure until now, the
Central Bank will continue to monitor the increases in consumer credits closely in the following
period and will send necessary signals to markets on potential risks that may obstruct the ongoing

downward trend of inflation or deteriorate the financial stability.

21. As it is emphasized repeatediy in our previous announcements and reports, it is of vital
importance to correctiy perceive the significance of the projected course of 12-month cumulative
inflation figures consistent with the target in 2004. In the first 5 months of 2003, inflation rates
climbed because of price hikes in food and agricultural products arising from cost-push factors
caused by Iİrag War as well as adverse weather conditions. With the removal of the said

conditions, CPI inflation pursued a rather modest trend for the rest of the year. These
developments led to an obvious discrepancy in inflation trend between the first and second halves
oOf 2003. As a natural outcome of this effect, which is also called as the base effect, the downward
trend in annual inflation will continue evidentiy in the next two months, as in the last guarter. On
the other hand, even though the downward trend in inflation continues in the rest of the year,
annual inflation rates may stop decreasing or may increase due to the base effect. Yet, such a
development will be consistent with the inflation target. At this point, it should be emphasized
once more that while making its monetary policy decisions, the Central Bank will continue to focus
itself on future course of inflation merely, not on the past inflation figures. Therefore, the
economic units should refer to general trend of inflation and the consistency of price increases to
be realized throughout 2004 with the inflation target, rather than the course of annual inflation

rate, which is a backward-looking indicator.

22. The rigidity in services sector inflation should be minimized for the sake of convergence of the
inflation in services to the goods sector, as well as the maintenance of downward trend in inflation
in 2005. This development is cosely related with the implementation of public pricing and incomes
policy consistent with the targeted inflation, the correct management of expectations, the
controlled recovery in domestic demand, and the establishment of a production process based on

market rules and open to competition, in other words with structural reforms.

23. The current program has had favorable effects on macroeconomic stability and in steering
expectations. As the inflation drops, there is an increasing consensus among every sector of the
society that still much remains to be done for achieving permanent price stability. Reforms on tax,
social security and public management are of vital importance for the sustainability of the
structural public balance in medium and long terms. Moreover, each step taken for enhancing the
economic role of private sector for the development of competitiveness and productivity, the
measures for increasing the public productivity and the guality of governance, the improvement of
investment environment and deepening the fiscal system, and each signal thereon will help

Turkey to achieve a long-term economic stability.

24. In current period, the continuation of structural reforms is of vital importance. If the
downward trend in inflation in 2005 is to be accompanied with high economic growth and rise in
employment, general productivity level must be increased through the accomplishment of ongoing
structural reforms as soon as possible. In general, realization of structural reforms, which means
the transformation of an İnstitutional structure that is the whole of rules, sanctions and
organizations in order to remove restrictions in the economy, seems inevitable for the removal of

obstacles to the productivity increase in production factors.
