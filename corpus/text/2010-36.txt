The Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) has been implementing  an inflation 
targeting regime since the beginning of 2006. Under t his regime, the CBT is 
accountable for achieving its main goal of price stability , and for the policies 
implemented to pursue this goal. Within this framework,  as stipulated by Article 42 of 
the Law, the accountability process is triggered when th ere is a significant deviation 
or potential deviation from the established inflation targets.  
 
The inflation target for end-2010 was jointly set wi th the Government at 6.5 
percent. The CBT policy document “Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy in 2010”, 
issued on December 10, 2009 stated that if the absolute  value of the difference 
between the actual inflation rate and the target rat e exceeds 2 percentage points at 
the end of any quarter, the accountability mechanism wo uld be enforced. In this 
context, it was stated that the CBT, in the case inflatio n falls outside the band within 
that year, would explain through the quarterly Inflation Report the re asons for the 
breach, and the measures that would be taken to ensure t hat inflation would revert to 
the pre-established targets. Should inflation fall out side the uncertainty band at the 
end of the year, the CBT would write an open letter  to the Government.  
 
The inflation outturn as of September 2010 was 9.24 p ercent, breaching the 
upper limit of the uncertainty band, which was set at 8 .5 percent. Accordingly, 
attached, for your consideration, is the latest Inflatio n Report issued on October 26, 
2010, which explains the reasons for the breach of the ta rget, and the strategy 
adopted by the CBT to bring inflation back in line wi th the medium-term targets. 
 
Yours Sincerely,
