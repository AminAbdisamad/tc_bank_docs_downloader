SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 23 July 2015
Inflation Developments
1. In June, consumer prices decreased by 0.51 percent, bringing annual consumer
inflation down by about 0.9 points to 7.20 percent. With the ongoing correction in
food prices, the decline in annual food inflation became more pronounced. Changes
in crude oil prices drove energy inflation lower, yet the depreciation of Turkish lira
constrained the disinflation. Core goods inflation was slightly up due to exchange
rate effects while services inflation remained elevated. Thus, both the annual
inflation and the underlying trend of core inflation indicators followed a flat course.
2. Annual inflation in food and nonalcoholic beverages was down by 3.54 points in
June to 9.28 percent. This decline was largely caused by unprocessed food prices,
while annual processed food inflation continued to slow. May’s fresh fruit and
vegetable-driven drop in seasonally-adjusted unprocessed food prices continued
into this period at a stronger pace thanks to increased supply. However, red meat
prices remained on the rise, affecting inflation negatively in associated categories
such as processed food and catering services.
3. After an upsurge since February, energy prices decreased by 0.17 percent in June,
bringing annual energy inflation down by 0.6 points to 2.78 percent. The fall in
energy prices was mostly attributed to bottled gas and fuel prices, while indicators
for July point to a continued decrease in energy prices.
4. Prices of services were up 0.88 percent in June while annual services inflation
remained unchanged at 8.85 percent, mostly due to restaurants-hotels and other
services. Annual inflation in rents and transport, on the other hand, decreased.
Despite the significant correction in food prices over the past two months, annual
restaurants-hotels inflation remained on the rise amid the ongoing upsurge in red
meat prices. Meanwhile, annual inflation in the subgroup of other services increased
due to rising prices of package holidays. As a result, underlying trend of services
inflation remained flat at an elevated level.

5. Annual core goods inflation increased by 0.09 points to 5.97 percent in June. Annual
inflation was up in durable goods due to base effects but down in other main
categories. The substantial April-May price hikes were replaced by a slowdown in
June across categories where exchange rate pass-through to prices is relatively
faster, such as home appliances and automobiles. Prices of automobiles increased
only modestly, while prices of furniture and electric/nonelectric appliances went
down. On the other hand, core goods excluding clothing and durable goods
continued to reflect the effects of cumulative depreciation in the Turkish lira. Hence,
underlying trend of core goods inflation registered a small increase in June.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6. Industrial production declined by 2 percent in May on a monthly basis. This fall
stemmed mainly from the production loss led by strikes in the automotive sector.
The lowering effect on industrial production of the contraction in the production of
vehicles is expected to be compensated for in the coming months. On a quarterly
basis, the production level in the April-May period is 1 percent higher than the
average production in the previous quarter. Assessing the PMI and BTS data
together, a strong rebound is not expected in industrial production in the second
quarter.
7. Data on the expenditure side suggest that production and imports of consumption
goods increased in the April-May period compared to the average of the previous
quarter. Domestic sales of home appliances recorded an uptick in this period.
Likewise, sales of automobiles in the second quarter stood above the first-quarter
average. Consumer confidence, on the other hand, continued to weaken due to
geopolitical risks and uncertainties in global markets. Among investment indicators,
production and imports of machinery-equipment posted a decline in the April-May
period in comparison to the average of the previous quarter. Production and
imports of mineral products, among the indicators for construction investment,
registered an increase in the same period. Construction employment remained flat
in April. Investment tendency maintained its sluggish course in the second quarter
of 2015. Accordingly, domestic private demand is expected to contribute to growth
moderately in the second quarter.
8. Following the contraction in the first quarter, the export quantity index excluding
gold increased at a modest rate in the April-May period compared to the previous
quarter, while the import quantity index excluding gold maintained its upward
trend. This suggests that the contribution of external demand to growth may be
limited in the second quarter. The weak course of the global economy and the
ongoing geopolitical developments put a cap on export growth. On the other hand,
the favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of
consumer loans continue to contribute to the improvement in the current account
balance.
9. In April 2015, total and non-farm unemployment rates fell by 0.1 and 0.2 points,
respectively. Employment in non-farm sectors rose while the increase in labor force

was limited, leading to a decline in the unemployment rate. Employment in the
industrial and services sectors rose, while construction employment fell in this
period. Since the last quarter of 2014, non-farm employment growth has been
driven by the services sector, while the industrial and construction employment
have fluctuated around a flat trend. The industrial production and survey indicators
suggest that the contribution of industrial sector to employment will be limited also
in the upcoming period. Services employment is anticipated to grow at a slower
pace in the upcoming period owing also to the stagnant tourism sector. Accordingly,
unemployment is not expected to record a notable decline in the rest of the year.
The current course of economic activity and the weakening investment tendency
pose downside risks to employment.
10. In sum, data on the second quarter of 2015 suggest a mild course in economic
activity. External demand remains weak while domestic demand contributes to
growth moderately. Meanwhile, geopolitical risks and uncertainties in global
markets besides the weak course of consumer and investor confidence pose some
risks to growth in the upcoming period
Monetary Policy and Risks
11. The Committee assessed the medium-term projections to be presented in the July
Inflation Report. Inflation in the second quarter proved close to the forecasts of the
April Inflation Report, while core inflation stood above the projections. In this
period, the fall in food inflation became the main driver of the improvement in
inflation, while core inflation rose mostly because of the exchange rate effects.
Analyzing the assumptions and external conditions that underlie the inflation
forecasts, the end-2015 inflation forecast is revised slightly upwards in view of the
developments in import and food prices besides the rise in core inflation driven by
the exchange rate. The Committee assesses that that the partial recovery in food
prices accompanied by the cautious monetary policy will limit the deterioration in
the inflation outlook and inflation will reach the target in the medium term.
12. Unprocessed food inflation had been quite unfavorable in the first quarter, leading
inflation to post high figures. However, recently there has been a notable correction
in food prices, which has affected inflation favorably. Similarly, the recent decline in
oil prices supports disinflation. On the other hand, exchange rate movements have
been especially influential in the core goods group, delaying the recovery in the core
inflation trend. This delay, combined with the uncertainty in global markets and
volatility in energy and food prices, makes it necessary to maintain the cautious
stance in monetary policy. The Committee has therefore decided to keep the
interest rates at current levels.
13. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the pace of improvements in
the inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, pricing behaviors and other factors
affecting inflation will be monitored closely and the cautious monetary policy stance
will be maintained by keeping the yield curve flat, until there is a significant

improvement in the inflation outlook. Besides the cautious monetary stance,
additional foreign exchange liquidity measures may be adopted, if exchange rate
movements continue to delay the fall in inflation.
14. Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy
stance and macroprudential measures. Commercial loans have recently been
following a robust course of growth, while consumer loans lost pace due to the
items excluding housing. Additionally, commercial loans grow faster than consumer
loans in line with the desired loan composition. Owing also to the recent partial
tightening in financial conditions, total credit growth is expected to slow somewhat
in the second half of the year. This loan outlook not only limits medium-term
inflationary pressures, but also contributes to the improvement in the current
account balance.
15. External demand remains weak while domestic demand contributes to growth
moderately. Although the recovery in the European economy affects the external
demand positively, ongoing geopolitical developments and the slowdown in global
trade restrict the export growth. Meanwhile, cumulative energy imports will
continue to decline if the current low levels of oil prices are maintained. As a result,
favorable developments in the terms of trade and the mild course of consumer
loans support the recovery in the current account balance, yet the relatively weak
export outlook limits this recovery. Domestic demand, on the other hand, exhibits a
mild increase driven mainly by consumption. Meanwhile, the weak course of
confidence indices coupled with domestic and external uncertainties are the risk
factors that may restrict the contribution of the final private demand to growth. In
this context, it is projected that the recovery in economic activity will be gradual,
and the aggregate demand conditions will continue to support disinflation.
16. Risks to global markets remain significant. Reduced predictability of the global
economy and increased uncertainties amid the divergence among the monetary
policies of advanced economies cause global markets to remain highly datasensitive. Against this background, the volatility in the risk appetite and capital flows
continues. The Committee underlined that, besides cyclical policies to stabilize
capital flows, structural measures to enhance the resilience of the financial system
are important as well. Accordingly, recent measures implemented to support the FX
liquidity, core liabilities, and long-term borrowing have enhanced the resilience of
the economy against global shocks. The Committee has stated that additional
measures along these lines may be adopted if deemed necessary.
17. Following the global crisis, especially during the exit process of the US monetary
policy, long-term rates in emerging economies have grown excessively sensitive to
global monetary policies. The wide interest rate corridor and the tight liquidity
policy implemented by the CBRT increased the resilience of our economy against
global shocks during this period. In the upcoming period, following the start of
normalization of global monetary policies, volatility in long-term interest rates may

decline permanently thanks to forward guidance policies. According to this baseline
scenario, the need for a wide interest rate corridor in our country may diminish over
time. In that case, the operational framework of the CBRT’s interest rate policy may
be simplified gradually. Members of the Committee asked the technical
departments to complete the preparations in this direction and to present them in
August meeting.
18. Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with
regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance
is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and
there will be no unanticipated hikes on administered prices. A revision of the
monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate
significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the
medium-term inflation outlook.
19. Sustained fiscal discipline has become a fundamental element in reducing the
sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years. In the
current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the value added from
maintaining and further advancing these achievements is significant. Any measure
that would ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings
deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social
welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels.
