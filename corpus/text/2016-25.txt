SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 21 June 2016
Inflation Developments
1. In May, consumer prices rose by 0.58 percent, and annual inflation remained flat
with 6.58 percent. Food inflation increased somewhat due to the base effect, yet
maintained its low course and continued to limit consumer inflation. In this period,
annual inflation in core indicators registered a decline, while improvement in the
underlying trend proved more evident.
2. Annual inflation in the food and non-alcoholic beverages group rose by 1.09 points to
2.47 percent in May. The low course of food inflation was mainly driven by
unprocessed food prices, the annual inflation of which was -4.22 percent. In this
group, prices of fresh fruits and vegetables remained below the previous year’s levels
due to increased supply of products, whereas red meat prices exhibited a mild
outlook amid the measures in effect. On the other hand, processed food inflation
sustained its high course due to prices of items other than meat and dairy products.
Although leading indicators on June indicate that unprocessed food prices may be
subject to a partial correction and the group’s annual inflation may soar, food prices
are expected to support the low course in inflation across the year. On the energy
front, prices rose by 1.10 percent in line with the international oil prices and
depreciating Turkish lira, while annual inflation sustained the favorable outlook with
1.65 percent.
3. Prices of services increased by 0.76 percent, and the annual services inflation stood
close to the previous month’s level with 8.74 percent in May. Being the culprit of high
figures in services inflation, the deceleration in restaurants-hotels and other services
groups in the last couple of months continued in May excluding package tour prices.
The mild course in food prices reflected favorably on prices in the restaurants-hotels
group, and the attenuated cumulative effects of the exchange rate underpins the
slowdown in inflation in other services. On the other hand, it is assessed that the
surge in unit labor costs in the first quarter is also responsible for the high course in
services inflation. Moreover, it is notable that rents soared in May as they did in
April. All in all, the underlying trend of services prices remained high in May.

4. Annual core goods inflation decreased by 1.29 points to 8.82 percent in May. Annual
inflation recorded a decline in all sub-groups, and the clothing and durable goods
groups stood out. Prices of durable goods registered a favorable outlook on account
of the fall in white goods and flat course of automobile prices in addition to declining
furniture prices following an uptrend in the first four months of the year. The
underlying trend of core goods improved further, and when clothing is excluded, the
improvement is still remarkable. Amid the decelerating cumulative exchange rate
effects, annual core goods inflation is projected to slow in the second half of the year.
5. In sum, inflation has recently recorded a notable decline driven mainly by the
unprocessed food prices. Core inflation indicators also recorded favorable figures, yet
remained high in May. Meanwhile, the improvement in the underlying core inflation
trend proved more remarkable in this period. Accordingly, annual inflation in core
indicators is projected to fall further in the upcoming period. However, the high
inflation trend in the services group coupled with the unit labor cost developments
limit disinflation.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6. According to TurkStat data for the first quarter of 2016, GDP grew by 4.8 percent
year-on-year. On the production side, industries and services made the greatest
contribution to the first quarter’s annual growth. Adjusted for seasonal and calendar
effects, GDP increased by 0.8 percent from the previous quarter. On the spending
side, consumption and exports were the main drivers of quarterly growth. In this
period, private consumption accelerated amid wage hikes, employment growth and
improving financial conditions. Exports were buoyed by the strengthening EU
recovery. Nonetheless, with imports gaining remarkably in the first quarter due to
increased consumption, net exports contributed negatively to quarterly growth. In
short, growth was driven largely by consumption and supported somewhat by
exports in the first quarter, yet capital accumulation remained moderate.
7. Data for the second quarter of 2016 indicate no additional acceleration for economic
activity. Industrial production dropped by 1.1 percent month-on-month in April on
the back of mining, vehicle, furniture and computer industries. May’s PMI indicators
and BTS indicators for orders over the last three months performed slightly better
than in April, suggesting some correction in industrial production for May. Given
favorable calendar effects and May’s strike-driven low base effect from automotive
manufacturing in last year, industrial production is expected to post a stronger yearon-year increase in May than in April.
8. Data on the spending front point to a slowing consumer demand and mildly
recovering investments for the second quarter. The production and imports of
consumer goods declined in April. Sales of home appliances fell marginally during
April-May, whereas sales of automobiles remained on the rise. Among indicators for
investments, imports of non-vehicle capital goods and machinery-equipment were up
from the previous quarter’s average, while their production dropped. Sales of light

and heavy commercial vehicles increased in the April-May period. The waning
uncertainty and improved financial conditions are believed to help investments
recover.
9. Favorable developments in the terms of trade accompanied by the moderate course
of consumer loans support the recovery in the current account balance. The growing
EU demand continues to support exports. High market-shifting flexibility of exports
limits downside risks caused by geopolitical developments. Yet, the falling number of
foreign visitors weighs on revenues from services, posing a downside risk to the
current account balance.
10. Seasonally-adjusted unemployment rates were down in March for the second
consecutive month. The strengthening non-farm employment growth pulled
unemployment rates down despite the increased labor force participation. Industrial
employment saw a moderate gain, while construction and services employment
expanded significantly. Failing to spread across all sectors, the employment growth in
services was driven mostly by public administration and community services. In view
of production and survey indicators, employment is expected to remain on a modest
track in the short term. Yet, the SSI data indicate that the stagnant tourism industry
has started to affect employment. Thus, the unemployment rate continues to face
upside risks for the period ahead.
11. In sum, current indicators suggest that the economy continues to grow at a moderate
and steady pace. Income channel supports domestic demand through wage
increases. Although geopolitical developments continue to pose downside risks, the
growing EU demand continues to support exports, and thus production.
Monetary Policy and Risks
12. Annual loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary
policy stance and macroprudential measures. Risk weight arrangements and wage
developments are expected to boost loan growth further in the upcoming period via
loan supply and household income channels. Thus, annual loan growth rates are
likely to remain at reasonable levels. With respect to the composition of loans,
commercial loans continue to grow faster than consumer loans. This composition not
only limits medium-term inflationary pressures but also supports the improvement in
the current account balance.
13. Economic activity remains on a moderate and steady growth track. In the first
quarter, GDP expanded on the back of domestic demand. Consumer spending
spurred domestic demand while investments remained weak. Despite the negative
implications of geopolitical developments in external demand, exports to the EU
remained on the rise. Accordingly, exports made a positive contribution to growth in
the first quarter. Domestic demand is expected to continue to support growth in the
upcoming period. Employment remains on a moderate upward path. Given wage
developments, employment growth is likely to support domestic demand further

through the income channel. On the external demand side, geopolitical tensions and
the weakening global growth continued to pose risks, while risks to the tourism
industry became prevalent. However, the robust increase in Turkey’s exports to the
EU and the market-shifting flexibility of exports alleviate the downside risks to
external balance. Moreover, the favorable impact of the cumulative fall in
commodity prices on the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans
contribute to the improvement in the current account balance.
14. Global financial markets remain volatile amid ongoing concerns over global growth,
developments regarding UK's exit from the EU and continued uncertainty about
global monetary policies. Accordingly, emerging-market portfolio flows slowed while
risk premiums and exchange rate volatilities recorded increases. The Committee
assesses that the tight monetary policy stance, the cautious macroprudential policies
and the effective use of the policy instruments laid out in the road map published in
August 2015 enhance the resilience of the economy against shocks. In fact, the
Turkish lira has followed a relatively less volatile path than other emerging market
currencies since September 2015. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to
take a measured step towards simplification by lowering the marginal funding rate.
Moreover, within the context of the road map, related departments made
presentations about the arrangements that would increase the predictability of
liquidity policy and make liquidity management of banks more efficient.
15. The sharp decline in food inflation since the beginning of the year helped to bring
consumer inflation markedly down. The recent improvement in the core inflation
indicators also contributed to this disinflation. Low imported-input costs and the
continued weakening of the lagged effects of cumulative exchange rate movements
support the improvement in the underlying core inflation trend. On the other hand,
the underlying services inflation trend remains elevated. High levels of inflation
expectations and unit labor cost developments restrain the improvement in the
underlying trend of inflation. To this end, the Committee stated that the current tight
liquidity stance should be maintained in order to ensure that the recently observed
disinflation becomes permanent.
16. In the upcoming period, the monetary policy stance will be conditional on the
inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and
the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be
maintained. Moreover, global and domestic volatilities will be monitored closely and
necessary measures will be taken for the foreign exchange and Turkish lira markets.
In sum, the policy stance will remain tight against the inflation outlook, stabilizing for
the FX liquidity and supportive of financial stability.
17. Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with
regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance
is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there
will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices. A revision of the monetary

policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from
this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term
inflation outlook.
18. Sustained fiscal discipline has become a fundamental element in reducing the
sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years. In the
current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the value added from
maintaining and further advancing these achievements is significant. Any measure
that would ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings
deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social
welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels.
