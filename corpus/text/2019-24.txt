To support the Primary Dealership System in view of  its contribution s to the deepening of financial 
markets and the effectiveness of monetary policy , it has been  decided that Primary Dealer banks 
are provided with a liquidity facility within the framework of open market operations.  
The interest rate to be applied to this liquidity facility , which will be used through overnight repo 
transactions within pre determined limits , will be set at  100 basis points below the Central Bank ’s 
policy interest rate.  The limits for the Primary Dealer liquidity facility  will be determined taking into 
account the amount of Government Domestic Debt Securities  purch ased by Primary Dealer banks 
through the Treasury auctions, and this facility will have a limited share within the overall Central 
Bank funding .
