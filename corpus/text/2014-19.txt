Governor Erdem Başçı made a presentation on “Economic Outlook and
Monetary Policy” in London.
Erdem Başçı, Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, made a
presentation on “Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy” in the meeting held in
London on 3 April 2014 Thursday at 12.00 hours local time in Turkey.
Governor Başçı emphasized the following points:
• Retail loan growth continues to slow down in response to the tight monetary
policy stance, recent macroprudential measures, and weak capital flows.
• The impact of monetary tightening on inflation will be observed with some
lag. Meanwhile, inflation is expected to increase until June, partly reflecting
the base effects.
• Exports will support growth while private final domestic demand will lose
momentum in the forthcoming period.
• The current account deficit will improve substantially in 2014.
