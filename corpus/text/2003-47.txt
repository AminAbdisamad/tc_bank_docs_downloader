THE CBRT PRESS RELEASE
ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE BUYING AUCTIONS
Considering that strong reserve position would boost the marketâ€™s confidence in the
current program and observing the excess foreign exchange supply, the Central Bank of
Turkey (CBRT) has been conducting foreign exchange buying auctions since 6 May 2003.
It was announced by our press release of 30 September 2003 that the excess foreign
exchange supply was expected to continue also in October, and the maximum amount of daily
foreign exchange auction could amount to USD 75 million, by the utilization of the buying
auction of USD 50 million, and the optional selling of USD 25 million. It was also announced
that the CBRT might, with a prior notice, make changes in the amounts of daily auctions due
to unexpected developments in the excess foreign exchange supply.
The CBRT has bought USD 271 million in total since the beginning of October by
conducting 4 foreign exchange buying auctions and optional selling after the auctions.
Accordingly, the daily average amount bought has reached USD 68 million, and the daily
average bids have amounted to USD 156 million in October. Both figures are higher than
those of September. The CBRT purchased USD 3,463 billion in total by means of auctions
and outright buying throughout September, and it is expected that the total amount of foreign
exchange supply in September would continue also in October along with the recent favorable
prospects on the Turkish economy. Considering these developments, the CBRT has increased
its daily buying auctions to USD 80 million effective from 7 October 2003 for the rest of
October 2003. Therefore, the maximum amount of daily foreign exchange buying auction can
amount to USD 120 million, by the utilization of the buying auction of USD 80 million and
the optional selling of USD 40 million. Also in the next period, the CBRT might, with a prior
notice, make changes in the amounts of daily auctions and/or optional selling due to
unexpected developments in the excess foreign exchange supply.
As was announced by previous press releases, the CBRT may, with a prior notice,
suspend the auctions before the end of the period in the cases where the depth of foreign
exchange market is lost and excessive volatility is observed in exchange rates due to an
external shock or unpredictable developments.
As usual, the CBRT will continue to closely monitor the volatility in exchange rates
and will directly intervene in the market in case of an excessive volatility in both directions.
