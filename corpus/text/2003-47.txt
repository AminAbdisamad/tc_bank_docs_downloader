to unexpected developments in the excess foreign ex change supply. 
The CBRT has bought USD 271 million in total since the beginning of October by

Accordingly, the daily average amount bought has re ached USD 68 million, and the daily 
average bids have amounted to USD 156 million in Oc tober. Both figures are higher than

prospects on the Turkish economy. Considering these  developments, the CBRT has increased 
its daily buying auctions to USD 80 million effecti ve from 7 October 2003 for the rest of

As was announced by previous press releases, the CB RT may, with a prior notice, 
suspend the auctions before the end of the period i n the cases where the depth of foreign 
exchange market is lost and excessive volatility is  observed in exchange rates due to an 
external shock or unpredictable developments. 
As usual, the CBRT will continue to closely monitor  the volatility in exchange rates 
and will directly intervene in the market in case o f an excessive volatility in both directions.
