PRESS RELEASE ON OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS

In addition to the daily one-week repo auctions, the Central Bank of the
Republic of Turkey (CBRT) will start holding one-month (4 weeks) repo auctions
every Friday. The one-month repo auctions will be held in traditional auction method
and each institution's total bid amount will be limited by the announced auction
amount.
The CBRT will announce the amount of one-month repo auction on Reuters'
"CBTF" page at 10:00 a.m. on Fridays. Auctions will be held at 11:00 a.m. on regular
business days, at 10:30 a.m. on half business days, and the utmost care will be taken
to announce the results on Reuters' "CBTG" page within 30 minutes. Institutions are
required to notify the CBRT of the securities against their repo operations until 12:00
p.m. on business days, until 11:30 a.m. on half business days, and fulfill their
obligations regarding open market operations until 4:45 p.m. on business days, 12:30
p.m. on half business days.
The aforementioned auctions will commence on December 30th, 2011. In
order to enhance banks' long-term liquidity foresight, the planned upper limits for the
total funding through one-month repo auctions and for the auction amount to be
announced for each auction will be posted on Reuters "CBTF" page.
For the period of 30 December 2011 - 26 January 2012, the upper limits have
been set as 12.0 billion Turkish lira for the total funding through one-month auctions
and 3.0 billion Turkish lira for each week's auction to be held in the said period.
Under extraordinary circumstances due to a significant unexpected change in
liquidity conditions, the CBRT may raise the amount of funding above the
preannounced maximum or may as well hold no auction.
