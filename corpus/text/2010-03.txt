SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: January 14, 2010

Inflation Developments
1. Consumer prices increased by 0.53 percent in December, driving annual
inflation up by 1 percentage point to 6.53 percent, owing to rising unprocessed
food prices and base effects stemming from the low levels of last year’s
energy and clothing prices. In other words, the December rise in annual
inflation is largely attributable to transitory factors and therefore does not point
to a deterioration in underlying trend inflation.
2. Unprocessed food prices continued to soar in December, recording the largest
fourth-quarter increase in six years. In contrast, the developments regarding
processed food prices have remained favorable.
3. Energy prices accounted for most of the base effect that drove annual inflation
higher in December. In fact, although energy prices rose by a mere 0.65
percent month-on-month, annual energy inflation was up by 3.4 percentage
points. Increases in prices of certain energy items in January, due to the
Special Consumption Tax and electricity price hikes, will add around 0.4
percentage points to headline inflation. Given these adjustments and base
effects, the annual rate of increase in energy prices is expected to increase
significantly in January.
4. The annual rate of increase in the prices of goods excluding energy and food
slowed down in December to 6.15 percent, mainly due to falling prices of
durable goods and pharmaceuticals. On the other hand, annual clothing and
footwear inflation increased owing to base effects. The new tax measures
implemented on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products in January to
restore government balances are expected to add about 1.1 percentage points
to CPI inflation.
5. Despite having increased slightly during December, annual services inflation
remains subdued. Higher meat prices continued to weigh on catering prices,
while annual rental inflation declined further, and prices for transport and other
services increased modestly.
6. The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) indicated that tax
adjustments and base effects would cause inflation to rise significantly over

the next two months and to remain above the target for some time. Yet, the
underlying trend implied by core inflation indicators is expected to remain at
levels consistent with medium-term targets. In this respect, it was emphasized
that inflation would display a declining trend once the temporary factors taper
off.

Factors Affecting Inflation
7. Recent data releases suggest that a moderate recovery in economic activity is
ongoing. Industrial production grew slightly month-on-month during November
2009 in seasonally adjusted terms; yet, the average production for the
October-November period was higher from a quarter earlier. Being on a slight
uptrend since the second quarter, capacity utilization continued to grow
modestly in the fourth quarter.
8. Industrial production contracted by 2.2 percent year-on-year in November, but
grew by 5.8 percent year-on-year in calendar adjusted terms. Accordingly, the
Committee once again highlighted the working-day effect due to religious
holidays during the final quarter and the base effect resulting from the marked
decline in production a year ago. Committee members noted that these effects
would cause industrial production to increase substantially year-on-year in
December, and stated that assessments regarding the economic recovery
should be based on data adjusted for seasonal and calendar-related effects.
9. Leading indicators suggest that domestic demand continues to recover
modestly. Consumption demand appears to have lost momentum following the
expiration of tax cuts intended to spur economic activity. Furthermore, the
rising trend in the production of consumer goods slowed during OctoberNovember. Imports of consumer goods have almost flattened. Despite a
further recovery during the fourth quarter, production and imports data
regarding investment demand indicate that investment demand still hovers
around lows levels.
10. Foreign demand continues to grow moderately. October-November average of
the export quantity index was up by 0.7 percent year-on-year, increasing in
quarterly seasonally adjusted terms. The course of foreign demand in the
upcoming period would be closely linked to the pace of the global recovery.
According to survey data, export orders do not point to a strong rebound in
exports in the short term, while insufficient foreign demand continues to rank
high among factors that prevent manufacturing industries from operating at full
capacity. Projections for the euro area, our largest trading partner, suggest
that it would take a long time for foreign demand to return to previous levels.

11. The outlook for employment and wages is of critical importance for domestic
demand over the medium term. Real wages had dropped sharply following the
employment slump during late 2008, and have restrained consumption
demand. In line with the reflection of the moderate economic recovery on the
labor market, real wages started to rise again by the third quarter of 2009.
Nevertheless, the current level of foreign demand continues to contain
economic activity and employment in general by suppressing industrial
activity. Hence, real wages in the short term are unlikely to bounce back to the
levels associated with past episodes of strong economic growth, and therefore
wage developments would continue to restrain domestic demand for quite
some time.
12. In sum, while the downtrend in consumer confidence indices and the ongoing
risks regarding the global economy continue to pose uncertainties regarding
aggregate demand, the economy continues on a moderate recovery track.
Given the current level of the economic activity and the pace of economic
recovery, the Committee expects that capacity utilization and employment
conditions would take a long time to fully recover.

Monetary Policy and Risks
13. The Committee indicated that tax adjustments and base effects would cause
inflation to rise significantly over the next two months and also remain above
target for some time. In this respect, January Inflation Report forecasts were
revised significantly upwards for 2010, compared to the previous Report.
However, noting that the underlying trend implied by core inflation indicators
would remain at levels consistent with medium-term targets, the Committee
emphasized that, given the low levels of resource utilization, the precarious
state of labor markets, and global economic conditions, general pricing
behavior would not be affected adversely by the temporary rise in inflation,
and therefore, inflation would display a declining trend once the transitory
effects taper off. Therefore, there has been no major change in the January
Inflation Report regarding the inflation forecasts for 2011 and thereafter.
14. The Committee noted that credit markets have continued to improve in
response to the monetary easing and the improvements in global risk
perceptions. The tightness in credit conditions have been moderating since the
publication of the July Inflation Report. Easing financial conditions and
declining loan rates have been strengthening the expansionary impact of
monetary policy. The October Inflation Report had stated that the credit
channel would begin to support domestic economic activity during the fourth

quarter of the year. In fact, credit demand has started to recover in this period,
especially with commercial loans picking up significantly. However, lingering
problems across the global economy are not resolved completely and there
are still uncertainties regarding the strength of the recovery. Accordingly, the
Committee has emphasized that it would be necessary to keep policy rates at
low levels for a long period of time.
15. The outlook for domestic economy has been largely shaped by global
developments since the intensification of the global crisis during the last
quarter of 2008. Given the important role of the trade and global financial
channels in the contraction of domestic economic activity during 2009, it is
expected that the global developments would continue to be the main driving
factor for the outlook for domestic activity and inflation in the forthcoming
period. Accordingly, the Committee assessed that both the risks on global and
domestic economic activity, as well as their impact on inflation should be
considered jointly.
16. Rising budget deficits and ongoing problems in credit and real estate markets
continue to pose downside risks for global activity, especially for developed
economies. Although the probability of another disruption in global economic
activity has been decreasing, it is still an important source of downside risk on
domestic economic activity and inflation. Should the global conditions
deteriorate again, and consequently delay the domestic recovery, the
Committee would consider further monetary easing.
17. Despite the prevailing downside risks on global and domestic economic
activity, upside risks have also been emerging since the second half of 2009,
given the pace of global recovery over this period. Moreover, it should be
noted that the impact of the unprecedented expansionary policy measures
since the last quarter of 2008 would be observed with a lag. Similarly, the
1025 basis points cumulative easing in policy rates of the Central Bank of
Turkey (CBT) between November 2008 and November 2009 would also be
fully transmitted with a lag. In this respect, the Committee indicated that,
should the recovery in domestic economic activity turn out to be faster than
expected, the limited monetary policy tightening implied by the baseline
scenario in the Inflation Report could be implemented earlier than envisaged.
18. According to the Committee members, the fact that inflation will rise in the
forthcoming period due to base effects and recent tax hikes, poses an
important risk factor through its potential impact on inflation expectations.
Several adverse factors (such as food, oil, base effects and administered price
hikes) have been leading to upward movements in inflation since the last
quarter of 2009. Although these factors are temporary, they will likely cause
headline inflation to stay at elevated levels for sometime. It is crucial that the

economic agents fully understand the temporary nature of these developments
while forming their medium- and longer-term expectations. Given the low
levels of resource utilization, the adverse impact of the depressed labor
market conditions on consumption expenditure, and the gradual removal of
fiscal stimulus, these temporary factors as well as other cost push pressures
would not lead to a significant deterioration in general pricing behavior.
Currently, services and core inflation are consistent with medium-term inflation
targets, and resource utilization is at low levels. Therefore, it is foreseen that
the policy rates would be maintained at low levels for a long period. However,
it should be underscored that the Committee will not hesitate to tighten
monetary policy sooner than envisioned under the baseline scenario of the
Inflation Report, should any unforeseen developments lead to a deterioration
in general price setting behavior.
19. Increasing budget deficits on a worldwide scale, especially in developed
economies, continue to pose risks on inflation expectations and thus on
longer-term global interest rates. Countries with relatively sounder banking
systems and prudent fiscal policies would be more resilient against these
risks. In this respect, the Committee will continue to monitor fiscal policy
developments closely while formulating monetary policy. Should the goals set
out in the Medium Term Program be implemented through institutional and
structural measures, rather than tax and administered price hikes, it would be
possible to keep policy rates at single digit levels throughout the forecast
horizon.
20. The Committee Members continue to view the course of oil and other
commodity prices as an important risk factor. Ample liquidity driven by
countercyclical policies on a global scale facilitates speculative movements for
commodity prices. Fast growth trends in countries like China and India, and
the rising share of these economies in global commodity demand, exacerbate
these speculative motives. Therefore, oil and other commodity price
developments may continue to rise, even under a scenario of a gradual global
economic recovery. At this point it is worth noting that weak domestic demand
conditions would limit the pass-through stemming from upside cost-push
shocks. Therefore, the Committee will not react to the first round effects of
short-term volatility in commodity prices, especially when the resource
utilization remains at depressed levels. However, if an uptrend in commodity
prices reflects a strong and durable rebound in global economic activity that
would in turn have adverse effects on inflation expectations, then the monetary
policy will be tightened appropriately to keep inflation in line with medium-term
inflation targets.
21. Since the last quarter of 2008, the CBT, without endangering its main objective
of price stability, has focused on containing the adverse effects of the global

crisis on the domestic economy, and this task has been achieved to a large
extent. Monetary policy will continue to focus on price stability in the period
ahead. Strengthening the commitment to fiscal discipline and the structural
reform agenda would support the improvement of Turkey’s sovereign risk, and
thus facilitate macroeconomic and price stability. In this respect, timely
implementation of the structural reforms envisaged by the Medium Term
Program and the European Union accession process remains to be of utmost
importance.
