PRESS RELEASE ON
THE PUBLICATION OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS

‘Financial Accounts’, mirroring financial linkages between sectors, have gained
prominence in the aftermath of the latest global crisis, as one of the areas of data
gaps recommended to be filled. The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT)
started to publish financial accounts on its website (www.tcmb.gov.tr) beginning from
28 December 2012. Within the scope of this project, jointly conducted with relevant
institutions under the coordination of the CBRT, accounts that belong to other
monetary financial institutions, financial intermediaries, financial auxiliaries, insurance
companies, central government and local government have been gathered so far.
Financial accounts pertaining to other sectors of the economy will be made public as
they are complete.
Methodological explanation on Turkey’s practice and statistical tables are
accessible on the CBRT website through Data/Periodic Data/Financial Accounts.
