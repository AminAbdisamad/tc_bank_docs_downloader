CENTRAL BANK OF THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY  
PRESS RELEASE  
 
In “Section V: Arrangements for the Operational Framework of Monetary and Foreign 
Exchange Policies” of the Central Bank’s press release “Monetary Policy and Exchange Rate 
Policy in 2002 and Prospective Developments” dated January 2, 2002, the working 
procedures to be made in the operation of Foreign Exchange and Banknotes Markets within 
the premises of the Cent ral Bank were announced for the information of the public.  
  
As it was stated in the press release, acting of the Central Bank as an intermediary in 
the Turkish Lira and foreign exchange markets by assuming the credit risks of market 
participants, due to p articular conditions of the period when these markets were established, 
no longer contributes to the well of the markets and creates distorted pricing mechanisms, in 
which risk perceptions are not fully reflected. Furthermore, markets may sometimes get the  
wrong idea about the transactions carried among the market participants, as if the Central 
Bank were the counterpart to thereof. This misunderstanding can give rise to wrong or 
confusing signals from the monetary and exchange rate policies. Making the ach ievement of 
price stability its primary objective, it is very important for the Central Bank to restructure its 
role in the Turkish Lira and foreign exchange markets so that its monetary policy and 
exchange rate policy may be better pursued and understood.  
 
Within this framework, the limits for the operations exclusively among those 
institutions which are allowed to make transactions in the Foreign Banknotes Against Turkish 
Lira Markets will be zero (0) as of July 1, 2002.
