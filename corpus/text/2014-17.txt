PRESS RELEASE ON THE FIFTH MEETING OF THE FINANCIAL
STABILITY BOARD REGIONAL CONSULTATIVE GROUP FOR THE
MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA

Today, the Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM), the central bank of Morocco,
hosted the fifth meeting of the FSB Regional Consultative Group for the
Middle East and North Africa (RCG-MENA) in Rabat.
Members of the RCG-MENA were updated on the FSB’s policy
priorities and work plan for financial regulatory reforms, which include
building resilient financial institutions, ending the problem of too-big-to-fail,
transforming shadow banking into a transparent and robust segment of the
financial system, and making derivatives markets safer. Members
discussed vulnerabilities in the global financial system and regional financial
stability issues, including the potential implications for the region of the
normalization of monetary policy in the advanced economies and the
changes in bank-funding patterns. They took stock of the impact in the
MENA region of the G-SIFI framework as well as the D-SIB frameworks,
which aim at enhancing systemic resilience, and shared implementation
challenges in adopting them in their respective jurisdictions. Members also
discussed the progress made in creating more effective resolution regimes,
which seek to address the problem of too-big-to-fail, in the region and
shared country experiences. In the context of systemic risk regulation,
members shared their experiences with respect to the measures for
strengthening oversight and regulation of shadow banking, and the role and
soundness of deposit insurance systems in the region. Members also
deliberated on the current status and prospects for development of Islamic
finance in the region.

The RCG-MENA is co-chaired by Erdem Başçı, Governor, Central
Bank of the Republic of Turkey and Riad Salame, Governor, Central Bank
of Lebanon. The current membership of the RCG-MENA includes financial
and regulatory authorities from Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait,
Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Turkey and the
United Arab Emirates. The list of members of the RCG-MENA is accessible

Notes to editors:
The FSB Charter stipulates that the FSB “should consult widely
amongst its Members and with other stakeholders including private sector
and non-member authorities. This process shall include engaging with the
FSB Regional Consultative Groups and include an outreach to countries not
included in the Regional Consultative Groups”1.
At the Toronto Summit in June 2010, the G20 Leaders endorsed such
a process by calling on the FSB “to expand upon and formalize its outreach
activities beyond the membership of the G-20 to reflect the global nature of
our financial system”2. Responding to the call, in 2011, six regional
consultative groups3 of the FSB were established, to bring together financial
authorities from FSB member and non-member countries to exchange
views on vulnerabilities affecting financial systems and on initiatives to
promote financial stability.
The FSB has been established to coordinate at the international level
the work of national financial authorities and international standard setting
bodies and to develop and promote the implementation of effective
regulatory, supervisory and other financial sector policies in the interest of
financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for
