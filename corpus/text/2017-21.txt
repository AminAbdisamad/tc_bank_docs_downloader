SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 26 April 2017
Inflation Developments
1. In March, consumer prices were up 1.02 percent and annual inflation increased by
1.16 points to 11.29 percent. As stated in the summary of the MPC meeting in
March, annual food inflation was the key driver of the rising consumer inflation in
this period due, among others, to the low base effect from a year earlier. On the
other hand, energy prices inched down amid lower international oil prices. Services
inflation remained high while core goods saw widespread price hikes due to the
lagged effect of the cumulative Turkish lira depreciation. Thus, core inflation
indicators remained on the rise.
2. Prices of food and nonalcoholic beverages increased by 1.93 percent in March,
bringing annual inflation up by 3.81 points to 12.53 percent in this subcategory. This
upsurge was mostly attributed to higher unprocessed food prices, particularly for
fresh fruits, and the low base effect. On the processed food front, prices continued
to rise rapidly month-on-month due to exchange rates, causing annual processed
food inflation to hit 7.28 percent. Leading indicators for April signal that annual food
inflation will increase sharply on the back of the base effect from unprocessed food.
Energy prices edged down by 0.95 percent amid lower international oil prices in
March. Accordingly, after having surged since June 2016, annual energy inflation
declined to 12.19 percent in this period.
3. Prices of services rose by 0.63 percent while annual services inflation inched up by
0.27 points to 8.64 percent in March. Annual inflation was up in transport and other
services but remained flat in other subcategories. Prices of transport services were
driven higher by the lagged effects of rising fuel prices. Across other services, both
exchange rates and the high level of headline inflation pushed inflation higher in
subcategories such as maintenance and repair, healthcare and education. Rent
inflation remained elevated.
4. Annual core goods inflation increased by 1.63 points to 10.46 percent in March. The
lagged spillovers of the depreciating Turkish lira continued to weigh on all

1

subcategories. Clothing and footwear prices soared much faster than historical
averages in March. Prices of durable goods were up mainly because of the exchange
rate-stricken auto industry. In this period, prices of core goods excluding clothing
and durables increased dramatically due to the exchange rate pass-through.
5. In summary, cost-push pressures and the volatility in food prices in recent months
have led to a sharp increase in inflation. Although the recent improvement in the
risk appetite contains some of the upside pressures from cost factors, current
elevated levels of inflation pose risks on the pricing behavior.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6. Data for the fourth quarter of 2016 confirmed the conjecture that the third-quarter
economic slowdown was transitory. In this period, the Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) expanded by 3.8 percent quarter-on-quarter and 3.5 percent year-on-year.
Excluding the offset work day losses of the third quarter, the fourth quarter was
marked by a moderate growth. The TURKSTAT’s upward revisions to the first three
quarters of 2016 showed that the level of economic activity was much higher than
anticipated. Hence, the economy grew by 2.9 percent in 2016, a rate much lower
than past years’ averages.
7. Annual growth was driven by domestic demand in the last quarter of 2016. Private
spending was up both annually and quarterly thanks to the demand brought
forward by automobile tax adjustments, eased macroprudential measures and
better financial conditions. Investments, particularly machinery and equipment
investments, were relatively weak in this period. With exports accelerating in the
last quarter, net external demand provided considerably higher contribution to
quarterly growth and a slightly better contribution to annual growth compared to
the first nine months of 2016.
8. The first-quarter data for 2017 hint at diminishing recovery in economic activity in
the first quarter. Following a robust increase in January, industrial production
contracted in February. Rapid depreciation of the Turkish lira at the start of the
quarter, uncertainties led by volatile financial markets and the leap in inflation are
projected to dampen consumption and investment spending. Although tax
incentives stimulate the demand for houses, furniture and home appliances, the
recovery in domestic demand fails to spread across all sectors. Indicators for March
and April signal for a stronger economic activity and labor market. In brief, the mild
recovery in the underlying trend of economic activity continues, which is enhanced
by supportive incentives and measures.
9. Despite a partial recovery in domestic demand, net external demand spurs growth
with robust increases in exports of goods that spill over into all sectors. The growing
demand from the European Union economies, normalizing relations with
neighboring countries, the course of the real exchange rate, and Turkey’s marketshifting flexibility abroad continues to stimulate exports. Increases in exports of
goods translate into a decelerated deterioration in the current account deficit and
2

improvement in core current account deficit indicators. In addition to the expected
partial recovery in tourism, the robust course of exports of goods is expected to
contribute positively to the current account.
10. The worsening trend in the labor market that began in May 2016 came to a halt in
January 2017. In this period, non-farm employment recorded an uptick particularly
with the contribution from the services sector. Meanwhile, leading indicators, such
as new job vacancies, the PMI employment index and the expectations for the
number of employees in services and construction for March and April suggest a
recovery in the employment outlook. Amid the mild rebound in economic activity
and the announced employment incentive packages, the partial improvement in
unemployment rates is expected to continue.
11. In sum, the recently released data indicate a gradual recovery in the economic
activity. Domestic demand conditions display a moderate improvement and demand
from the European Union economies continues to contribute positively to exports.
With the supportive measures and incentives provided recently, the economic
activity is expected to gain further pace in the forthcoming period. However, the
course of capital flows in line with uncertainties regarding global economic policies,
geopolitical developments, the subsided course of the labor market and the
lingering volatility in exchange rates may stand out as factors to limit the pace of
growth in 2017.
Monetary Policy and Risks
12. Financial market impact of expectations about post-election US economic policies
has started to wane since early 2017. Compared to the previous reporting period,
indicators of economic activity point at a stronger global growth in 2017, owing
especially to advanced economies. However, uncertainties over the Brexit process
and blurred prospects for post-electoral economic policies in the US keep downside
risks to global growth brisk. As of the first quarter of 2017, the upward trend in
advanced economies’ long-term bond yields which started in November came to a
halt, and portfolio flows to bond and stock markets of emerging economies resumed
thanks to abated uncertainties over the Fed policy accompanied by optimistic
expectations in financial markets. Although there is a slight recovery in recent global
financial conditions, the pace of the Fed’s monetary tightening cycle will be the
determining factor on the direction and volume of portfolio flows to emerging
economies.
13. Despite the relative improvement in global financial conditions, domestic financial
conditions tightened slightly in the first quarter of 2017 due to the partly persistent
volatility in the exchange rate market and the tightening in monetary policy. On the
other hand, the Turkish lira has recently diverged positively from other emerging
economy currencies and offset past losses to some extent. Moreover,
macroprudential policies supporting the financial system, public incentives and
public credit guarantees allowed credit conditions to continue to recover. The
3

recovery in consumer loans and Turkish lira denominated commercial loans
observed in the first quarter of 2017 is monitored closely with regard to its effects
on aggregate demand and economic activity.
14. Downside risks to economic activity have recently abated. The growth outlook for
2017 is expected to be more favorable compared to 2016 which was subject to
numerous concurrent adverse shocks. The relative stability in tourism revenues, the
strengthened confidence channel, the favorable effect of the cumulative exchange
rate depreciation on net exports, and the normalization of commercial relations
with Russia will all contribute to growth. Moreover, measures and incentives to
stimulate consumption and investment expenditures, fading perceptions of
uncertainty and the improvement in the tightness of financial conditions will also
enhance growth. Accordingly, economic activity is expected to strengthen as of the
second quarter of the year. On the other hand, the pace of recovery in tourism
revenues, uncertainties regarding monetary policies of advanced economies, the
course of capital flows and geopolitical developments constitute downside risks to
growth in 2017 as well as it has recently.
15. Consumer inflation has surged since November 2016 and rose above the upper band
of January forecasts. The upward trend in inflation was largely driven by the
depreciation in the Turkish lira and the rise in import prices in addition to the
increase in food prices. The rapid depreciation in the Turkish lira spread across the
consumer price index, particularly to energy and durable goods items.
16. The Committee evaluated medium-term projections to be presented in the April
Inflation Report in the meeting. Year-end inflation forecasts for 2017 and 2018 were
revised upwards by 0.5 and 0.4 points, respectively, compared to the 2017 January
Inflation Report. Given a tight policy stance that focuses on bringing inflation down,
inflation is estimated to converge gradually to the 5-percent target. Accordingly,
inflation is likely to be 8.5 percent at end-2017, and stabilize around 5 percent in the
medium term after falling to 6.4 percent in 2018. As also indicated in the previous
Report, due to the base effects stemming from the prices of unprocessed food,
tobacco and clothing as well as temporary tax reductions, consumer inflation will
fluctuate throughout 2017. Inflation is expected to reach the highest levels in AprilMay particularly due to the base effect from unprocessed food and the lagged
effects of the exchange rate, and then to fall thereafter as the impact of last year’s
price increases in energy, alcohol-tobacco products and food gradually diminishes.
The tight monetary stance will support the disinflation process.
17. Aggregate demand conditions on which medium-term inflation forecasts are based,
continue to have a disinflationary effect albeit at a more limited extent in
comparison with the January Report. The upward revision in last year’s national
income data and the acceleration in credit indicate that the recovery in economic
activity might be stronger than expected. However high levels of unemployment
rates suggest that the demand-side risks on inflation are balanced. The effects on

4

aggregate demand conditions, of production and employment incentives and
measures to boost the credit market, will be closely monitored in the upcoming
period.
18. Risks to food inflation – another major determinant of inflation forecasts – are
considered to be on the upside. Due to the recovery in the exports of food products
and the impact of the exchange rate developments, food inflation might exceed
current projections, which are based on the assumption that measures taken by the
Food Committee will considerably balance the upside risks to food prices.
19. Although the recent improvement in the risk appetite contains some of the upside
pressures from cost factors, current elevated levels of inflation pose risks on the
pricing behavior. Accordingly, the Committee decided to strengthen the monetary
tightening in order to contain the deterioration in the inflation outlook, and raised
the Late Liquidity Window lending rate from 11.75 percent to 12.25 percent in its
April meeting. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained until inflation
outlook displays a significant improvement. The CBRT formulates monetary policy in
consideration of the medium-term inflation outlook, thus, focuses on the
developments in the underlying trend of inflation rather than the anticipated
fluctuations in inflation driven by the base effects during the course of the year.
Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be
closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.
20. Developments in fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard
to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance for the
upcoming period is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be
maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices. A
revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy
deviate significantly from this framework and have an adverse effect on the
medium-term inflation outlook.
21. In recent years, sustained fiscal discipline has been one of key factors in lowering
the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks. Countercyclical fiscal
policy has been implemented recently, thanks to the space provided by fiscal
discipline. Structural measures, which would improve the potential to implement
countercyclical fiscal policy, will contribute to the coordination of monetary and
fiscal policy, and thus support macroeconomic stability.
