PRESS RELEASE  
  
I- DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MONETARY PROGRAM DURING THE     
MARCH -APRIL 2002 PERIOD  
  
The targets specified in the Letter of Intent (LOI) dated 18 January 2002 
as the performance and indicative criteria from the main monetary aggregates on 
the Central Bank balance sheet have been achieved. The details of the said 
targets and actual figures realised are given below:  
  
1. As is known, in the 2002 Monetary Prog ram, the monetary base was 
taken as the nominal anchor and the ceilings were set for it as the performance 
criteria during the first half of the year and as the indicative targets for the 
rest of the year. The ceiling set for the end -April 2002 was 8.900 t rillion 
Turkish liras. The average monetary base figure for the said period has been 
realised as 8.680 trillion Turkish liras, well below the target ceiling of 8.900 
trillion Turkish liras.  
  
2. In the LOI, a floor was set for the Net International Reserv es 
(NIR) as the performance criteria, which is calculated by subtracting the IMF 
credit tranche received by the Treasury and the short -term foreign exchange 
debt of the Treasury with maturity less than 1 year from the CBRT Net 
International Reserves. As of  30 April 2002, the realised CBRT NIR and its 
component items are as follows :   
        (Million in US dollars)  
CBRT Net International Reserves  (1)  6.659  
Treasury’s debt to the IMF           (2)  10.283  
Treasury’s foreign exchange debt with 
maturity less than 1 year        (3)  1.302  
Net International Reserves under the 
IMF program                        (4=1 -2-3) -4.926  
 
Thus, taking these figures into consideration, the CBRT NIR materialised 
as (minus)  –4.926 million USD, well above the performance target floor of 
(minus) –7.200 million USD.  
 3. Similarly, in the LOI, a floor was set for CBRT Net Domestic Assets 
(NDA) as an indicative target, which is calculated by adding the Turkish lira 
equivalents of the IMF credits received by the Treasury and the short -term 
foreign exchange debt of the Treasury with maturity less than 1 year to the 
CBRT NDA. The said target for the end -April 2002 was 27.700 trillion Turkish 
liras and its calculation is based on the a veraging of the figures realised in the 
last five business days of April. As of 30 April 2002, the realised CBRT NDA and 
its component items are as follows :  
                                   (Trillion TL)  
CBRT Net Domestic Assets            (1)  8.519 
Treasury’s debt to the IMF           (2)  14.803  
Treasury’s foreign exchange debt with 
maturity less than 1 year        (3)  1.875  
Net Domestic Assets under the  
IMF program                        (4=1 -2-3) 25.197  
 
 
Thus, the average NDA realised is 25.197 trillion Turkish liras, which is 
below the indicative target -ceiling figure of 27.700 trillion Turkish liras.  
  
II- TARGETS OF MONETARY PROGRAM FOR THE MAY -JUNE 2002 
PERIOD.  
  
1. The target for the monetary base, which is a performance criterion 
for the         end -June, is 9.250 trillion Turkish liras. Calculation will be based on 
the averaging of the figures realised in the last five business days of June.  
  
2. The floor set as a per formance criterion for the NIR is (minus) –
7.800 million USD for the end -June.  
  
3. The ceiling set for the NDA for the end -June, which is an indicative 
target, is 28.900 trillion Turkish liras. Calculation will be based on the averaging 
of the figures rea lised in the last five business days of  June.
