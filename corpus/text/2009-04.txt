DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Meeting Date: January 15, 2009
Committee Members
Durmuş Yılmaz (Governor), Erdem Başçı, Burhan Göklemez, M. İbrahim Turhan,
Abdullah Yavaş, Mehmet Yörükoğlu.
The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to lower the policy
rates as follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate is decreased from 15 percent to 13
percent, while lending rate is decreased from 17.50 percent to 15.50 percent,
b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate between 4:00 p.m. –
5:00 p.m. is decreased from 11 percent to 9 percent, while lending rate is
decreased from 20.50 percent to 18.50 percent,
c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities
provided for primary dealers via repo transactions is decreased from 16.50
percent to 14.50 percent.
Recent readings indicate that the slowdown in the domestic economic activity
has further intensified. Latest forecasts suggest that ongoing problems in international
credit markets and the global economy will last longer than previously envisaged.
Therefore, downward pressures on both domestic and external demand and inflation
will continue. Moreover, significant drops in oil and other commodity prices are having a
favorable impact on disinflation. The Committee predicts that inflation will be close to
the target by mid-2009, and that the probability of undershooting the target by the end of
the year has increased.
The Committee has judged that moving forward a sizeable portion of the rate
cuts envisaged for the coming months would help offset the tightening in financial
conditions. The Central Bank will continue to take the necessary measures to contain
the adverse effects of the global financial turmoil on the domestic economy, provided
that they do not conflict with the price stability objective. Uncertainties regarding the
impact of the problems in financial markets on the real economy remain at high levels.
The extent and the timing of a possible future rate cut will depend on the factors
affecting inflation outlook.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation
outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within
eight working days.
