MARKETS – FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEPOSIT MARKET
As it is known, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey has been taking
various measures in order to ensure orderly liquidity flow in the financial system and
efficient functioning of credit markets by stimulating increased foreign exchange liquidity
flow in the interbank foreign exchange market. For this purpose, as of 21 November
2008, the maturity of FX deposits borrowed within the predetermined borrowing limits by
banks from the Foreign Exchange Deposit Markets in terms of US Dollar and Euro was
extended and the lending rate in the said market was reduced.
Meanwhile, considering recent developments with regard to interest rates in the
international money markets, the Central Bank has decided to readjust the conditions for
the foreign exchange liquidity facility provided to the banking system in line with the
above-mentioned objective. Within this framework, as of today, the Central Bank has
decided to;
a) extend the maturity of the FX deposit borrowed within the predetermined
borrowing limits by banks from the Foreign Exchange Deposit Markets in terms
of US Dollar and Euro from one month to three months,
b) accordingly, extend the maturity of matched interbank transactions in the said
market from a maximum of one month to three months,
c) reduce the lending rate for transactions which the Central Bank is a party from
7 percent to 5.5 percent for US Dollar and from 9 percent to 6.5 percent for
Euro.
In the upcoming period, developments regarding the foreign exchange markets
will be closely monitored and other measures previously announced by the Central Bank
will be taken immediately when deemed necessary.
