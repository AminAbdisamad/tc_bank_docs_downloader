PRESS RELEASE  
29 August 2015 
Press Release on the Maximum Interest Rates for Cre dit Cards 
in Q4 2015  
The monthly maximum interest rates that banks can c harge on credit card borrowing 
in the fourth quarter of 2015 have been left unchan ged. 
The CBRT sets maximum interest rates for credit car d borrowing under legal authority 
expressed most recently in the CBRT Communiqué No. 2014/5 on Maximum Interest 
Rates to be Applied to Credit Card Transactions pub lished in the Official Gazette No: 
29153 dated 22 October 2014. Accordingly, to be eff ective from 1 October 2015, for 
the credit card borrowings, the monthly maximum con tractual interest rate will be 
2.02 percent for the Turkish lira and 1.62 percent for foreign exchange transactions, 
whereas the monthly maximum overdue interest rate w ill be 2.52 percent for the 
Turkish lira and 2.12 percent for foreign exchange transactions. 
Banks are not allowed to charge higher interest rat es than the rates announced by 
the CBRT for credit cards. Banks are free to determ ine their respective rates at their 
own discretion provided that they are below these c eilings. The maximum 
contractual and overdue interest rates for credit c ard transactions for the three-
month period starting on 1 January 2016 will be ann ounced by the CBRT prior to that 
date. 
Banks in Turkey, as is the case in other countries,  charge higher interest rates for 
credit card borrowing than they do for consumer loa ns. The CBRT therefore advises 
credit card holders with short-term credit needs to  seek a consumer loan rather than 
borrowing on personal credit cards.
