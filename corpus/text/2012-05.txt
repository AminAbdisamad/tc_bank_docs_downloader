PRESS RELEASE ON  
OPEN MARKET OPERATIO NS 
As announced in its press release of 25 November 2011, the Central Bank of 
the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) informs the public on a regular basis regarding the 
planned amount of funding provided to banks via one- week repo auctions in order to 
facilitate their liquidity management and to assist them in estimating their total funding cost. In the same way, the CBRT has announced the planned lower limi t of 
the outstanding total amount of funding (one- week repo funding amount) provided via 
one-week repo auctions on Reuters “CBTF” page.  
As a continuation of the current implementation, the Governor of the CBRT 
indicated in his presentation at the Istanbul Chamber of Industry that the CBRT’s 
daily funding amounts related to one- week repo auctions conducted via the quantity 
auction method would be set between 3 and 7 billion TL in order to facilitate banks’ liquidity management until the next Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting.  
At its meeting on 24 January 2012, the MPC decided to keep the daily funding 
amount via quantity auctions between 3 and 7 billion TL on normal days until the next 
MPC meeting to be held on 21 February 2012.  The lower and upper lim its of this 
funding will continue to be announced on Reuters “CBTF” page after each MPC meeting.  
Furthermore, by taking into consideration TL liquidity  forecasts  and the 
high levels of Treasury  account balance, the upper limit for the total funding amount 
planned to be provided for the period 27 January to 23 February 2012 through one-month repo auctions, which were introduced in accordance with the liquidity 
management strategy outlined in the Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2012, 
has been set as 20 billion TL, and the upper limit for each auction to be held in the 
said period has been set as 5 billion TL .  
 Under extraordinary circumstances, due to any significant unexpected change 
in liquidity conditions, the CBRT may provide funds different from th e pre- announced 
limits.
