THE CBRT PRESS RELEASE

A) THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE BUYING AUCTIONS
Considering that strong reserve position would boost the marketâ€™s confidence in the current
program and observing the excess foreign exchange supply, the Central Bank of Turkey has initiated to
hold foreign exchange buying auctions as of 6 May 2003.
Since it was predicted that the excess foreign exchange supply would increasingly continue in
July as well due to the seasonal factors, the daily auction amount was increased to USD 40 million in
early-July. In July, the CBRT bought USD 440 million through foreign exchange buying auctions, held
on 11 working days by 16 July 2003.
However, it is observed that the increase in the excess foreign exchange supply is realizing
beyond the expectations in July owing to the seasonal factors. Hence, the daily average amount of bids
for foreign exchange buying auctions in July showed an increase compared to June.
In this context, it was decided to increase the daily amount of auctions to USD 50 million
starting from 17 July 2003 provided that all other auction conditions will remain the same. This decision
was made during the communication process that has been continuing uninterruptedly with the
participants.
As usual, the CBRT will continue to closely monitor the volatility in exchange rates and will directly
intervene in the market in case of an excessive volatility in both directions. Moreover, as were
announced by our previous press releases, the CBRT may, with a prior notice, suspend the auctions
before the end of the period in the cases where the depth of foreign exchange market is lost; and
excessive volatility is observed in exchange rates due to an external shock or unpredictable
developments.
B) THE TURKISH LIRA DEPOSIT BUYING AUCTION PROGRAM FOR JULY
With the initiation of foreign exchange buying auctions as of April 2002 due to the reverse
currency substitution and considering the excess liquidity of TL 6.5 quadrillion sterilized by the CBRT
at that time, the CBRT has started to conduct weekly Turkish Lira deposit buying auctions amounting to
a maximum of TL 100 trillion with a standard four-week maturity with the aim of enhancing the
effectiveness of its efforts to sterilize the excess Turkish Lira liquidity in the system and generating a
reference interest rate of indicator nature for a four-week period for the markets.
The maximum amount to be bought in Turkish Lira deposit buying auctions with a standard
four-week maturity, which have been held every week on Wednesday and Friday in July, was TL 200
trillion. The total amount, which was sterilized through the auctions, realized as TL 1.5 quadrillion by 16
July 2003.
Despite the Turkish lira liquidity that was pumped into the markets through foreign exchange
buying auctions started on 6 May 2003 and direct foreign exchange buying interventions of May and
June, a decline was observed in the sterilized excess Turkish lira liquidity. In this framework, it was
decided to cut down the maximum amount of the four-week Turkish lira deposit buying auctions to TL
100 trillion starting from 18 July 2003.
