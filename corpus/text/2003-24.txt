THE CBRT PRESS RELEASE 
 
A) THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE BUYING AUCTION PROGRAM FOR JUNE 
As was made public on 5 May 2003 the Central Bank o f Turkey (CBRT) 
disclosed the auction program for May, and started to hold foreign exchange buying 
auctions effective from 6 May 2003, due to the exce ss foreign exchange supply 
resulting from the reverse currency substitution pr ocess, and considering that strong 
reserve position would boost the market’s confidenc e in the current program. In the 16 
auctions held between 6 and 29 May 2003 the CBRT bo ught USD 319 million. In 
addition, the USD 579 million in total was bought b y means of outright buying 
interventions made on 12 and 21 May 2003 upon exces sive volatility in exchange 
rates. In total, the CBRT bought USD 898 million in  the month of May as of 29 May 
2003 through foreign exchange buying auctions and o utright buying interventions.  
It is predicted that the process which generate exc ess supply in foreign exchange, 
as was assessed in our press release of 5 May 2003,  should continue in June too. 
Therefore, it has been decided to announce a foreig n exchange buying auction 
program for June as well and the total amount of da ily foreign exchange buying will 
be increased to USD 30 million, due to the seasonal  increase in foreign exchange 
supply in June. Accordingly, in June 2003 there wil l be foreign exchange auctions on 
21 working days, and the maximum amount to be bough t will be USD 630 million. 
Other auction conditions being the same, institutio ns willing to participate in the 
auctions are required to send in their bids by mean s of “Electronic Fund Transfer” 
system beginning on 2 June 2003instead of telephone .  
As always, the CBRT will continue to closely monito r the developments in 
excess foreign exchange supply, and the foreign exc hange buying auction program for 
July 2003 and the daily amounts to be bought will b e announced at the end of June.
