Under the explicit inflation targeting regime that the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey 
(CBRT) has been implementing since early 2006, when the inflation significantly deviates from the 
target or a possibility thereof arises, the “accountability” mechanism steps in pursuant to Article 42 
of the CBRT Law . In this context, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) is acc ountable 
for reporting to the Government and announcing to the public the reasons for the deviation from the 
inflation target and the necessary measures to be taken . 2020 y ear-end inflation was above the 
uncertainty band. This document elaborates on the re asons for the deviation of inflation from the 
target, and explains the measures already taken and to be taken to bring inflation back on track with 
the target.  
Factors Affecting Inflation in 2020  
The policy rate cuts, which started in July 2019, continued  and comprehensive liquidity 
measures were taken in the first half of 2020  to contain the adverse effects of the Covid-19 pandemic . 
In addition to the monetary policy rate cuts and targeted liquidity facilities offered to the bank ing 
sector , the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency’s Asset Ratio Rule aiming to  encourag e 
banks to extend loans and purchase securities  was effective from the beginning of May, and it 
reinforced  the expansionary macro policy stance . 
The annual credit growth a ccelerated as of the second quart er, leading to an expansion even  
beyond the rapid credit expansion of 2017 driven by the Credit Guarantee Fund (Chart 1). This strong 
credit expa nsion was  visible in consumer loans led by general purpose and housing loans,  as well as 
in corporate loans . Although the rapid improvement in credits and monetary aggregates , thanks to

monetary and financial policies , has supported the rapid recovery in economic activity, it spawned 
adverse effects on current account balance, exter nal financing facilities and the inflation outlook . 
Despite the improvement in  exports of goods, the current account deficit widened  rapidly  due to the 
decline in tourism revenues and the rise in imports. In addition to global uncertainties, the 
deterioration in inflation expectations  has led to a stronger dollarization  trend . In this period, 
residents’ demand for FX and gold rose pushing gold  imports above historical averages and made a 
negative impact on the external balance.  On the back of increasing macrofinancial risks and 
deterioration in expectations, high levels of foreign capital outflows from portfolio and swap markets  
were observed . The s imultaneous acceleration in the dollarization trend in domestic deposits and the 
corporate sector’s tendency to decrease FX liabilities contributed further to the increase in external 
financing need s. Thus, the external imbalances led by domestic dem and-driven rapid growth have 
caused a n upswing in  country risk premium and lied heavy  on exchange rates and reserves  (Chart 2) .

In 2020, d emand -side factors underpinned by strong credit impulse became an important 
driver of inflation via direct and indirect channels. On one hand, inflation pressure s increased  in the 
sectors  with strong demand conditions . On the other, the rapid economic recovery owing to credit 
expansion, which led to an adverse loop among reserves, risk premium, dollarization and inflation 
expectation s played an important role in the rise in inflation via the exchange rate  channel. On the -100102030405001.17

back of the global economic recovery in the second half of 2020, prices of oil, industrial metals and 
agricultural commodities increased significantly and affected inflation via energy, core goods and 
food groups. Indicators pertaining to the underlying trend of inflation and pricing behavior point that 
core inflation is still high and price increases  are spread across a wide range of sectors.  
Consumer inflation ended 2020 at 14.6% and remained outside the uncertainty band around 
the 5% target . Both demand and cost factors contributed to the rise in inflation. After being flat around 
12% in the first quarter of the year, as a consequence of the pandemic, consumer inflation declined  
to 10.94% in April, the lowest level of the year. In the second  half of the year, however, both direct 
and indirect channels  of the strong credit impulse were the main determinants of  inflation.  
The rapid economic recovery driven by the buoyant volume of  expansion in monetary 
aggregates and credits not only pushed up demand -side inflationary pressures but also caused a 
significant deterioration in the current account balance. Reserves bottomed out due to capital outflows 
and increasing  external financing needs. The negative spillovers of this unfavorable outlook on the 
sovereign risk premium, dollarization and inflation expectations led to depreciation of the Turkish 
lira to and take an instrumental role in the rise in inflation. Exchange rate developments and higher 
commodity prices as well as strong demand conditions and supply constraints  evident in some sectors  
caused producer inflation to soar in the second half of the year and to end 2020 at 25.15%.  
 The impact of the  divergence across sectors in 2020,  due to p ande mic dynamics and the macro 
policy mix , were evident  on inflation. Goods and services categories reflecting  weak demand 
conditions due t o the pandemic  restrained consumer inflation, whereas  inflation remained high in  
categories where the pass -through from credit and exchange rate developments  were relatively high . 
Thus, inflation was 15.87% for goods and 11.66% for services.  
In 2020, the Turkish lira depreciated by 25% against the currency basket. This depreciation 
was evident across all subcategories, core  goods in particular, which exhibit a high exchange rate 
pass-through. After materializing at 8.18% in the first quarter of the year, core goods inflation surged 
to 17.24% at the end of the year. Durable goods were the main driver of the increase in core g oods 
inflation. Inflation in durable goods (excluding gold) increased from 11.39% in the first quarter to 
30.4% at the end of the year.

Food prices also played an important role in the rise of inflation. Processed food inflation, 
which was 16. 08% at the be ginning of  2020, fluctuated throug hout the year and ended up at 15.52%. 
Unprocessed food inflation, on the other hand, displayed  a much more negative outlook. Standing at 
2.22% in January, unprocessed food inflation ended  the year at a high level of 26.3 4%. Despite the 
weak course of tourism, cumulative exchange rate effects and the rise in international agricultural 
commodity prices were instrumental on the rise in food prices.  
Services inflation remained rigid around 11 -12% throughout the year. Pandemic -related 
mobility restrictions weakened activity in many sectors, primarily the accommodation and catering 
services, recreation and culture, transport, and educational services. Although demand conditions had 
a downward effect on inflation in some services groups, the pandemic -driven increase in unit costs 
restrained the fall. Tax cuts introduced for some sectors throughout  the year partially eased 
inflationary pressures  as well . In this period, significant price increases were observed  in sectors  with 
highe r exchange rate  pass-through , such as maintenance and repair, and health services. The increase 
in services inflation in the last two months of the year was mainly driven  by food prices and 
cumulative exchange rate effects.  
Meanwhile, inflation -restraining  developments came into focus  in 2020, during which sectoral 
divergences became evident. Energy, along with the alcoholic beverages and tobacco group pulled  
consumer  inflation down significantly. Alcoholic beverages and tobacco inflation pursued a favorable 
course due to b ase effects. After posting a noticeable decline in April as the effects of the pandemic 
crystalized , oil prices trended upwards in response to the gradual normalization steps all over the 
world . Nevertheless, they remained below th eir pre -pandemic levels. The US dollar -denominated oil 
prices declined by 34% in 2020 compared to the previous year. Thus, energy inflation was 5.64% in 
spite  of the depreciation of the Turkish lira  and contribut ed marginally  to consumer inflation. Inflati on 
remained relatively low in subcategories  such as clothing, accommodation, education, recreation and 
culture, and transport services where demand remained weak due to the pandemic.  
Domestic demand conditions, cumulative cost effects - particularly through  exchange rate s-, 
increasing international food and other commodity prices , supply constraints that became more 
pronounced  in certain sectors and high levels of inflation expectations continue to affect the  pricing 
behavior  and inflation outlook adversely.

Measures Taken to Reach the Inflation Target  
CBRT started to take the necessary steps to tighten  the pandemic -specific policies in August 
in order to contain inflation expectations and risks to the inflation outlook. Nevertheless, the strong 
demand conditions due to cumulative effects of the rapid credit expansion, continued to roll adversely 
over the current account balance and inflation outlook in the second half. The CBRT introduced a 
clear  and strong monetary tightening in order to eliminate risks to the inflation outlook, contain 
inflation expectations and rapidly restore the disinflation process, there by raising the policy rate to 
15% from 10.25 % in November  (Chart 3) . Moreover, the CBRT decided to adopt a simple operational 
framework to enhance transparency and predictability, and to provide all short -term funding at the 
one-week repo rate, i.e., the main policy rate. Accordingly, on 20 November  2020, the CBRT started 
to provide funding via one -week quantity repo auctions, the main monetary policy tool, instead of 
traditional -method repo auctions with one -month maturity and the previously  employed Late 
Liquidity Window (L LW) facilities.  
MPC  assessed the need for a reserve requirement policy revision in order to enhance the 
effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism in line with the primary objective of price 
stability  in its November meeting . Accordingly, the CBRT decided to repeal the reserve requirement 
practice that linked the reserve requirement ratios and remuneration rates to real loan growth rates, 
and apply the same reserve requirement ratios and remuneration rates to all banks. The simplification 
of the reserve requirement polic y contributed to increasing the transparency and predictability of the 
monetary policy. Moreover,  changes  in Turkish lira and foreign currency reserve requirement ratios  
supported the CBRT’s monetary stance and the effective functioning of the monetary transmission 
mechanism.

Source : BİST, CBRT . 
The strong communication regarding monetary policy tightening and price stability had 
positive implications for the markets, thereafter i mproving  financial indicators. Enhancing policy 
predictability by adopting a price stability -oriented and simple operat ional framework has led to a fall 
in the risk premium, exchange rate volatility and long -term interest rates, and a rise in capital inflows 
since November.  
The CBRT delivered a strong monetary tightening  in December, taking into account the end -
2021 foreca st target . The one -week repo auction rate, i.e., the policy rate, was increased to 17% from 
15%. The developments in international commodity prices, supply constraints that became more 
discernible in certain sectors, and the minimum wage and administered p rices in the period following 
the December MPC decision  shaped the CBRT’s evaluations of the inflation outlook for 2021 . 
Accordingly, in January  MPC meeting , the CBRT strengthened the tight monetary policy stance via 
its forward guidance stating that the t ightness of the monetary policy stance will be maintained 
decisively “for an extended period” until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and 
price stability and that “additional monetary tightening will be delivered if needed”.  
The decelerating impact of the strong monetary tightening implemented in November and 
December MPC meetings on credit and domestic demand is expected to become more significant; 
hence the effects of demand and cost factors on inflation are envisaged to wan e gradually. 591317212501.20

Accordingly, inflation is projected to be 9.4% at the end of 2021, and fall to 7% at the end of 2022 
before stabilizing around 5% in 2023, which is the medium -term target. Inflation  is expected to be 
between 7.3% and 11.5% (with a mid -point of  9.4%) at the end of 2021 and between 4.6% and 9.4% 
(with a mid -point of 7%) at the end of 2022 with a 70% probability (Chart 4). 
Chart 4: Inflation and Output Gap Forecasts*  
 
Sources: CBRT, TURKSTAT .  
* Shaded area denotes the 70% confidence interval for the forecast.  
Forecasts are produced under the assumption that monetary policy will be tight enough to 
ensure that inflation remains in line with the 2021 and 2022  forecast targets. It is also assumed that a 
pandemic -led negative shock to global growth as well  as the external demand outlook will not occur  
once again  and that the recovery in Turkey -specific risk perceptions will continue amid the 
improvements in the global risk appetite. In the forecast path for 2021 ; wages, food prices and 
international commodity prices have an upward effect on inflation, whereas administered prices and 
inflation expectations are assumed  to have a downward effect . In view of this interaction, the strong 
impact to be generated by the t ight monetary stance is projected to bring inflation down to 9.4% by 
the end of 2021.  Yet, upside risks on these forecasts remain significant. Hence, maintaining  the strong 
and tight monetary policy stance becomes inevitable .

Monetary Policy Strategy to R each Price Stability  
The main principles of the monetary policy that will be  implement ed in pursuit of the price 
stability objective are outlined in the Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy document published on 16 
December as follows: (i) Implementing full -fledged inflation targeting regime decisively within a 
simple operational framework. (ii) Adopting a tight and decisive monetary policy stance with a 
priority and focus of price stability.  (iii) Strengthening communication by adhering to the 
transparency, p redictability and accountability principles. (iv) Implementing the floating exchange 
rate regime. (v) Strengthening foreign exchange reserves and using all available instruments to this 
end under appropriate conditions in a transparent way and within a spe cific plan when the 
predetermined strategic criteria are met. (vi) Safeguarding financial stability as well as price stability.  
In an inflation targeting regime, central banks aim to control the future inflation with a 
medium -term perspective by taking into account the transmission lags of the monetary policy . Since 
monetary policy decisions influence aggregate demand and inflation with a lag, it is more effective 
to set the  policy stance in line with inflation forecasts. In this regard, the forecasts annou nced in 
Inflation Reports are also “forecast target s” and interim targets by serving as reference s to inflation 
expectations. In other words, to steer expectations more efficiently while converging to the medium -
term inflation target, the reference values that will guide economic units regarding the future trend of 
inflation are the inflation forecasts for the shor t term and the inflation target  for the medium term.  
Considering the current levels of inflation together with the upside risks, it is clear that we are 
significantly away  from the 5% target. The forecasts in the January Inflation Report show  that the 
inflation target of 5%  is attainable in 2023. Thus , the t ight and cautious monetary policy stance should  
be maintained resolutely for a long  time until 2023, the year when it is expected to achieve the 5% 
target.  
In order to reach the medium term 5% target , a full -fledged inflation targeting will be 
implemented . Within this period, evolution of inflation around the envisaged forecast path will be 
continuously and closely monitored. Accordingly, until the target of 5% is reached, the level between 
the realized  and expected inflation rate path and the monetary pol icy rate path will be set considering  
a strong disinflationary balance; and this balance  will be sustained . Besides the current information

set, if any new information arrives pointing at the risk of inflation expectations and pricing behavior 
diverging fr om the medium -term target path, additional front -loaded and decisive  tightening will be 
implemented. Accordingly, indicators for the underlying trend of inflation and pricing behavior, 
diffusion indices, demand and cost factors and inflation expectations w ill be monitored closely for 
their compatibility with the targets in the forecast horizon.  
This tight monetary policy stance will contribute to the decline  in the country risk premium, 
encouragement of Turkish lira savings, beginning of revers e currency s ubstitution, foreign exchange 
reserves  to enter into  an increasing trend  and a perpetual decline in financing costs. This will not only 
foster macroeconomic and financial stability, but it will also enable the adjustment of the level of 
monetary tightening  under these circumstances.  
The fiscal consolidation to be ensured through the strengthening of the coordination between 
monetary and fiscal policies as part of the strong policy coordination in pursuit of the medium -term 
target of 5% will provide a key i nput to achieve inflation targets. Accordingly, sustaining the fiscal 
discipline in a decisive manner continues to be a critical  priority. In addition to the fiscal stance, 
determining the  administered prices and tax adjustments, income policy and public b orrowing 
strategy in line with the monetary policy targets will support our fight against inflation. Besides, the 
reform steps to be taken in the field of law and economy will make a significant contribution to the 
disinflationary process through the expec tations channel.  
Continuing with structural reforms to curtail the inertia and volatilities in inflation will 
contribute to price stability and social welfare, in turn. In this context, the CBRT will maintain its 
efforts to analyze structural factors, deve lop policy recommendations and raise awareness for the 
importance of disinflation among related stakeholders and the public.  
On the other hand, there will also be steps to improve the credibility of the monetary policy 
via improvement and increase in transparency, predictability and accountability  in the design and 
implementation of the monetary policy.  
As a result, the Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the 
price stability objective completely, promptly, effectively,  strongly and decisively . Meanwhile, the 
inflation -targeting regime mainly relies on focusing and commitment of all layers of the society  on
