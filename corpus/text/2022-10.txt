Press Release on the Introduction of
“YUVAM” Accounts
1 February 2022

No: 2022-10

In order to encourage non-resident Turkish citizens to repatriate their savings to Türkiye,
the Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye has decided to introduce “Deposit and
Participation Scheme for Non-Resident Turkish Citizens (YUVAM)” accounts to be held in
domestic banks.

In order to encourage Turkish citizens living abroad to repatriate their savings to Türkiye, to
establish a savings framework allowing non-resident citizens to protect the value of their savings
and leveraging the contributions of such savings to Türkiye’s economic development and balance
of payments, the CBRT will introduce a facility under following conditions:
•

•
•
•

•
•

Non-resident Turkish citizens can benefit from this incentive if they transfer FX funds
that they keep at banks abroad to FX deposit or participation accounts in USD, EUR and
GBP in domestic banks and convert them to YUVAM accounts in TRY.
YUVAM accounts can have maturities of 3, 6, 12 and 24 months.
While protecting the YUVAM account holders from the exchange rate volatility, the CBRT
may provide additional returns varying by maturities.
The interest/profit share that will be accrued to YUVAM accounts by domestic banks will
be compared to the sum of the change in exchange rates at the end of the maturity and
the additional returns that will be paid by our Bank, and the higher amount will be paid
to the deposit or participation account holder.
In case of withdrawal of money from the account before maturity, the account holder
will not be able to benefit from the incentive.
The Communiqué and Implementation Instructions concerning YUVAM accounts have
been published on our Bank's website (available only in Turkish).
