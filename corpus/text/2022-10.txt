“YUVAM” Accounts  
1 February 2022  No: 2022-10 
In order to encourage non -resident Turkish citizens to repatriate their savings to Türkiye, 
the Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye has decided to introduce “Deposit and 
Participation Scheme for Non -Resident Turkish Citizens  (YUVAM) ” accounts to be  held in 
domestic banks.  
I
n order to encourage  Turkish citizens living abro ad to repatriate their savings to Türkiye , to 
establish  a savings framework allowing non-resident citizens to protect the value of their savings 
and leveraging the contributions of such savings to Türk iye’s economic development and balance 
of payments, the CBRT will introduce a facility  under following conditions:  
•Non-r esident Turkish citizens can benefit from this incentive if they transfer FX funds  
that they keep at banks abroad to FX deposit or participation accounts in USD, EUR and  
GBP in domestic banks and convert them to YUVAM accounts in TRY.
•YUVAM accounts can have maturities of 3, 6, 12 and 24 months.
•While protecting the YUVAM account holders from the exchange rate volatilit y, the CBRT  
may provide additional returns varying by maturities.
•The interest/profit share that will b e accrued to YUVAM accounts by domestic banks will 
be compared to the sum of the change in exchange rates at the end of the maturity and  
the additional returns that will be paid by our Bank, and the higher amount will be paid  
to the deposit or participation account holder.
•In case of withdrawal of money from the account before maturity, the account holder  
will n ot be able to benefit from the incentive.
