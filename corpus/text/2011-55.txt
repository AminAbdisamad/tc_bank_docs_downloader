 PRESS RELEASE ON OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS  
In its meeting on November 23, 2011, the Monetary P olicy Committee decided 
that the impacts of the measures undertaken on cred it, domestic demand, and 
inflation expectations would be monitored closely a nd the amount of Turkish lira 
funding via one-week repo auctions would be adjuste d on both sides, if needed. 
In this perspective, the Central Bank of the Republ ic of Turkey (CBRT) will 
inform the public on a regular basis regarding the planned amount of funding 
provided via one-week repo auctions in order to fac ilitate banks’ liquidity 
management and to assist them in estimation of thei r total funding cost. Bi-weekly 
every  Friday morning at 9:30, the planned lower li mit of the outstanding amount of 
funding (one-week repo funding amount) for any day throughout the following 
maintenance period will be announced on Reuters “CB TF” page. 
In addition to the one-week repo auctions, banks, i n exchange for their 
collaterals that they have, will continue to meet t heir liquidity needs by using primary 
dealer’s overnight repo facility and overnight borr owing facility in the Interbank Money 
Market within the CBRT within their limits; borrowi ng from the CBRT at its lending 
rate in the Repo and Reverse Repo Market of the Ist anbul Stock Exchange without 
any limit.       
For example as of November 24, 2011 Thursday evenin g, while primary dealer 
banks’ overnight funding amount was 9.9 billion Tur kish lira, banks’ one-week repo 
funding amount was realized at 28 billion Turkish l ira.  
For any day during the maintenance period between N ovember 25 – 
December 8, 2011, the planned lower limit for the o ne-week funding amount is 
determined to be 20 billion Turkish lira.     
In case of exceptional circumstances due to a signi ficant unexpected change 
in liquidity conditions, the weekly funding amount might be less than the planned 
amount.
