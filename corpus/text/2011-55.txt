PRESS RELEASE ON OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS

In its meeting on November 23, 2011, the Monetary Policy Committee decided
that the impacts of the measures undertaken on credit, domestic demand, and
inflation expectations would be monitored closely and the amount of Turkish lira
funding via one-week repo auctions would be adjusted on both sides, if needed.
In this perspective, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) will
inform the public on a regular basis regarding the planned amount of funding
provided via one-week repo auctions in order to facilitate banks’ liquidity
management and to assist them in estimation of their total funding cost. Bi-weekly
every Friday morning at 9:30, the planned lower limit of the outstanding amount of
funding (one-week repo funding amount) for any day throughout the following
maintenance period will be announced on Reuters “CBTF” page.
In addition to the one-week repo auctions, banks, in exchange for their
collaterals that they have, will continue to meet their liquidity needs by using primary
dealer’s overnight repo facility and overnight borrowing facility in the Interbank Money
Market within the CBRT within their limits; borrowing from the CBRT at its lending
rate in the Repo and Reverse Repo Market of the Istanbul Stock Exchange without
any limit.
For example as of November 24, 2011 Thursday evening, while primary dealer
banks’ overnight funding amount was 9.9 billion Turkish lira, banks’ one-week repo
funding amount was realized at 28 billion Turkish lira.
For any day during the maintenance period between November 25 –
December 8, 2011, the planned lower limit for the one-week funding amount is
determined to be 20 billion Turkish lira.
In case of exceptional circumstances due to a significant unexpected change
in liquidity conditions, the weekly funding amount might be less than the planned
amount.
