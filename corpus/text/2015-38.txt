Press Release on Reserve Requirements
The coverage of liabilities subject to reserve requirements of foreign branches of
banks incorporated in Turkey has been broadened. With this regulation, foreign
branches of banks will also be encouraged to borrow longer term.
Since the implementation will apply to foreign branches’ liabilities emerging after 29
May 2015, this regulation will not have any noteworthy impact on the financial
position of the banks.
