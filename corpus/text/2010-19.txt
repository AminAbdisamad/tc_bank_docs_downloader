SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: June 17, 2010

Inflation Developments
1. Consumer prices decreased by 0.36 percent in May and annual inflation
declined by 1.09 percentage points to 9.1 percent. The fall in annual inflation
was largely due to plunging unprocessed food prices, as noted in the May
summary of the Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) Meeting. Prices
in other categories portrayed a favorable outlook as well, while core inflation
indicators continued to be consistent with medium-term targets.
2. Changes in unprocessed food prices had a major impact on food prices in
May. Prices of fresh vegetables dropped by 34.6 percent with the favorable
supply conditions. In addition, the announcement of less restrictive import
regulations for red meat brought meat prices down, contributing to the
downward pressure on food prices. Accordingly, the direct impact of meat
prices on annual CPI inflation was down from 1.9 in April to 1.6 percentage
points in May. Early observations suggest that the decline in annual food
inflation has continued into June.
3. Despite the recent fall in meat prices, the cumulative increase over the past
one year continued to have an adverse impact on catering prices. On the other
hand, annual rent inflation continued to trend steadily down, while falling
mobile call rates helped lower the annual rate of increase in prices of services.
Overall, the average rate of increase in prices of services slowed further in
seasonally adjusted terms.
4. Despite rising solid fuel prices, energy prices remained flat for the second
consecutive month amid falling international oil prices. However, annual
energy inflation continued to rise on the back of the low base effect from 2009.
The Committee has noted that this base effect-driven increase would end in
June, and expects the annual rate of increase in energy prices to decelerate
by the second half of 2010 unless there is a sizable increase in oil prices.
5. The year-on-year increase in core goods (goods excluding food, energy,
alcoholic beverages, tobacco and gold) slowed to 4.84 percent. Both the
easing of commodity prices and the weakening of the euro contributed to the
downtrend of annual core goods inflation, leading to some moderation in core

inflation indicators. It should be noted that the base effects from last year’s tax
incentives that drove annual core goods inflation higher during March and April
would reverse in June, July and October and help improve core inflation
indicators.

Factors Affecting Inflation
6. Recent data suggest that the recovery in economic activity is ongoing.
Industrial production grew by 0.8 percent month-on-month during April in
seasonally adjusted terms, up by 2 percent from the first quarter average.
Indicators for May show that the economy continues to recover, albeit more
slowly. Yet, the Committee emphasized that production is still below pre-crisis
levels.
7. Domestic demand growth is relatively stable. The Committee members noted
that production growth is stronger in sectors more sensitive to domestic
demand. Production and imports data indicate that private consumption
demand continued to recover moderately during the second quarter.
Consumer confidence indices and new order data also confirm this outlook.
The slow yet steady improvement in the labor market and the favorable credit
market developments are supporting the recovery in private consumption
demand.
8. Investment demand continues to recover, although investments remain below
pre-crisis levels. The production of capital goods excluding vehicles continues
to grow, while imports of capital goods remain on the rise. The Committee
expects that growing domestic demand and lower commercial loan rates
would continue to support the investment recovery. Yet, the Committee noted
that new order and confidence indices fell, albeit modestly, during May and
June amid mounting problems in the euro area, and indicated that downside
risks to the pace of domestic demand growth should not be underestimated.
9. Uncertainty regarding foreign demand has been increasing. The export
quantity index excluding gold continued to recover gradually during April in
seasonally adjusted terms, whereas recent survey indicators signal slowing
export orders. Medium-term growth outlook of the Euro area has recently been
revised down amid severe cutbacks in government spending aiming at
restoring budget balances in several European countries. Therefore, foreign
demand is likely to recover gradually, and it would take a while before
industrial capacity utilization rates return to pre-crisis levels.
10. Although employment conditions continue to improve, unemployment rates
remain at elevated levels. Seasonally adjusted data indicate that non-farm
employment continued to recover in March. Weak foreign demand continued

to restrain industrial employment, while non-farm employment rose further
owing to the recovery in construction and services sectors. Nevertheless, the
Committee reiterated that the high level of unemployment rates would
continue to contain unit labor costs.

Monetary Policy and Risks
11. The Committee noted that the fall in unprocessed food prices and easing
commodity prices have led to a more favorable inflation outlook than
envisaged in the April Inflation Report, which is also having a positive impact
on inflation expectations. Annual unprocessed food inflation is expected to
further decline in June. Committee members have stated that the fall in fruit
and vegetable prices partly reflect temporary favorable supply conditions due
to early harvest of summer products, while the decline in meat prices can be
attributed to more durable factors. Besides favorable developments in food
prices, oil prices have been lower than envisaged in the April Inflation Report,
leading to a downward revision in the short-term inflation forecasts.
12. The Committee members indicated that the favorable outlook in inflation is not
only confined to food and energy prices, as core goods and services inflation
have been also moderating recently. It was stated that, given the
developments in cost and demand factors, core inflation would remain at
levels below the year-end target and consistent with the medium-term targets.
13. The Committee indicated that countercyclical monetary and fiscal policies
have been continuing to support the recovery in economic activity. Recent
data releases suggest that the production in sectors that are sensitive to
domestic demand continues to increase. Credit developments indicate a
similar outlook. The compression of spreads between business lending rates
and demand deposit rates and the ongoing recovery in loans to small- and
medium-sized enterprises since the beginning of the year, suggest that the
credit conditions have been improving steadily.
14. The Committee indicated that, notwithstanding the relatively stable domestic
demand, uncertainties regarding the pace of economic recovery have become
more significant. Heightened debt sustainability concerns in Greece and many
other European countries have been increasing the downside risks regarding
the recovery in Europe—our major trade partner. The significant depreciation
of the Euro could adversely affect the competitiveness of exports. Moreover,
these developments have the potential to affect domestic demand adversely
through the expectations channel. In fact, leading indicators suggest that
business and consumer confidence have slightly moderated in June.
According to the Committee members, it would be early at this stage to

change the stance of the monetary policy; however, the impacts of the
problems regarding global economy on the domestic economic activity should
be monitored closely in the forthcoming period.
15. In light of these developments, the Committee reiterated that it may be
necessary to maintain policy rates at current levels for some time, and to keep
them at low levels for a long period.
16. The Committee will continue to monitor fiscal policy developments closely
while formulating monetary policy. Should the fiscal rule—which is to be
adopted at the beginning of 2011—be implemented decisively as envisaged, it
would contribute to the decline in risk premiums, and by decreasing
government borrowing costs enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy.
Since the second half of 2009, economic activity has been stronger than
envisaged in the Medium Term Program (MTP), leading to a better than
expected performance in budget revenues. Using this fiscal space resulting
from the cyclical factors mostly to reduce the government debt, as implied by
the fiscal rule, would facilitate demand management and ease the need for
indirect tax hikes, therefore providing more room to conduct countercyclical
monetary policy.
17. Monetary policy will continue to focus on price stability in the period ahead.
Strengthening the commitment to fiscal discipline and the structural reform
agenda in the medium term would support the relative improvement of
Turkey’s sovereign risk, and thus facilitate macroeconomic and price stability.
In this respect, timely implementation of the structural reforms envisaged by
the Medium Term Program and the European Union accession process
remains to be of utmost importance.
