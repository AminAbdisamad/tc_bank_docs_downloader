THE CENTRAL BANK OF THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY  
PRESS RELEASE  
 
As is known, through several press releases, the Central Bank has announced 
that the current foreign exchange regime was neither a fixed rate system nor a 
regime with a fixed rate of increment or one that was intended to be kept at a level 
not consistent with economic fundamentals through frequent interventions. It has also 
been reiterated that the level of foreig n exchange rate was determined by the supply -
demand conditions in the markets but still the volatility in the foreign exchange rate 
was being supervised and that there always existed the possibility of a direct 
intervention in case there emerged an excessi ve volatility in both directions in the 
markets.  
  
As a matter of fact, an increasing volatility has been observed in the foreign 
exchange rates due to the political uncertainty in the last few days. Our assessment 
of these developments has been detailed i n our press release dated June 28, 2002. 
As it was stated in the mentioned press release, the current economic program has 
been designed having considered the probability of shocks and uncertainties not 
originating from within the economy, and the structur al reforms that have been 
implemented within the framework of the program up till now have decreased the 
vulnerability of the economy to uncertainties and external shocks. The institutional 
arrangements carried out under the scope of the program assure tha t the 
autonomous institutions will pursue their current policies. In other words, besides its 
legal responsibility of maintaining the price stability, as a supportive objective, the 
Central Bank will continue to supervise the financial stability in coopera tion with other 
authorized institutions.  
 
As of today, the gradually increasing political uncertainty perceptions in the 
markets caused the volatility in the foreign exchange rate and interest rate to gain a 
new momentum not hinging on economic fundamenta ls. 
 Therefore, with the aim of containing the excessive volatility in the foreign 
exchange rate, the Central Bank has directly intervened in the foreign exchange 
market.
