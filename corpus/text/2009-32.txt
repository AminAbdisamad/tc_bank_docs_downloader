SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: October 15, 2009

Inflation Developments
1. Consumer prices increased by 0.39 percent in September, while inflation
declined to 5.27 percent year-on-year. Core inflation measures remained
subdued, whereas the annual rate of increase in services prices continued to
fall steadily.
2. Annual inflation in food prices dropped slightly over the month to 6.79 percent.
The favorable course of fruit and vegetable prices during the past two months
continued into September, while meat prices accelerated further. Taken
together, unprocessed food inflation eased to 16.70 percent year-on-year. In
the processed food category, prices continued to fall year-on-year. Looking
ahead, fruit and vegetable prices are expected to pick up owing to seasonal
factors in October, while processed food prices are likely to remain on the
decline.
3. Energy prices rose by 0.63 percent in September amid rising tap water rates
and bottled gas prices. Accordingly, the rate of increase in energy prices
climbed to 2.01 percent year-on-year. The hike in electricity tariffs, effective
October 1, would add about 0.4 percentage points to CPI inflation.
4. The annual rate of increase in prices of goods excluding energy and food
declined to 5.52 percent, owing to ongoing discounts on clothing and footwear
in September, in contrast with previous years. In the durable goods (excluding
gold) category, prices rose by 0.20 percent in September, and inflation
increased to –1.37 percent year-on-year. It should be noted that prices of
durable goods are likely to rise markedly in October following the expiration of
temporary cuts in Special Consumption Tax (SCT) and Value Added Tax
(VAT).
5. Annual services inflation continued to fall in September, down to 5.26 percent,
the lowest level in recent history. The drop was particularly evident in rental
and transport services inflation. Under current domestic demand conditions,
annual services inflation is expected to edge further down in coming months,
albeit at a more modest pace.
6. Overall, the Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) expects consumer
prices to accelerate temporarily in October due to seasonal increases in food

and clothing prices, the hike in electricity tariffs and tax adjustments on
durable goods. However, the Committee expects that annual inflation would
continue to hover around low levels.

Factors Affecting Inflation
7. In line with the Committee’s previous assessments, recent data releases
indicate that the ongoing recovery in economic activity would be gradual and
protracted. During July-August, industrial production declined by 7.7 percent
year-on-year, yet registered a modest increase over the second quarter in
seasonally adjusted terms. Moreover, September’s capacity utilization data do
not point to an acceleration in production growth. Therefore, the Committee
noted that capacity utilization rates are not likely to revert back to historical
averages over the short run.
8. Second quarter national accounts data confirm that the fiscal stimulus-driven
recovery in domestic demand has been confined to certain goods categories,
and therefore is likely to be transitory as previously stated. This outlook is also
supported by third-quarter indicators. The ongoing weakening of the demand
for non-durable goods is especially noteworthy, causing consumer goods
production to dip below its second quarter average during July-August in
seasonally adjusted terms. Similarly, imports of consumer goods were down
during July-August compared to the previous quarter. Accordingly, having
increased markedly during the second quarter, consumption demand is
expected to display a weaker course in the third quarter.
9. Domestic investment demand remains weak. During July-August, the
production of capital goods was up from the second quarter, whereas the
imports of capital goods remained flat. Excluding transport vehicles, the
production of capital goods has also continued along a flat trend. Thus, the
Committee noted that the third quarter rise in the production of capital goods
has largely been the result of tax cuts, rather than a rebound in investment
demand.
10. Foreign demand remains weak. Growth forecasts, particularly for the euro
area, point to a more positive outlook for foreign demand over the short term
as of September, and expectations about the speed of the medium-term
recovery have slightly improved, compared with the July Inflation Report.
Recent export figures are consistent with this outlook. The export quantity
index rose sharply quarter-on-quarter during July-August in seasonally
adjusted terms, but fell by 7.6 percent year-on-year. The medium-term outlook
for global growth suggests that it would take a long time for the GDP to reach
its pre-crisis levels across advanced economies. This outlook points to a

gradual narrowing of output gaps across advanced economies, implying a
sluggish recovery of exports over the near term. Accordingly, the Committee
reiterated that foreign demand is likely to continue to weigh down on
aggregate demand for quite some time.
11. The June-August data signal that non-farm employment has ceased to
contract during the third quarter. During this period, despite having declined by
1.9 percent year-on-year, non-farm employment increased in seasonally
adjusted terms for the first time since the second quarter of 2008, driving
unemployment down from the second quarter in seasonally adjusted terms.
The Committee agreed that, although employment indicators show some
improvement, it remains to be seen whether this would turn into a robust
recovery across the labor market.
12. The lack of a clear sign of durable global recovery and the ongoing uncertainty
about aggregate demand continues to cause companies to operate at low
capacity levels. In addition to low capacity utilization and employment rates,
per capita hours worked also hovers below pre-crisis levels. The Committee
expects the sluggish resource utilization and the resulting idle capacity to
continue to adversely affect investment and employment decisions. On
balance, labor market conditions are likely to remain a drag on domestic
demand, and thereby expected to continue supporting the decline in inflation.
Therefore, inflation is expected to remain at low levels for a long period of
time.

Monetary Policy and Risks
13. The policy rate cuts implemented since November 2008, and the
improvements in global risk perceptions have started to have favorable effects
on credit markets. In fact, consumer loan rates, which were reacting rather
sluggishly to the policy rate cuts, have displayed a significant decline in this
period. Consequently, housing loans have displayed a stable upward trend
since September. More generally, the recovery in credit markets is expected to
continue throughout the last quarter. However, the effectiveness of the credit
channel in supporting economic activity has been somewhat restrained owing
to the ongoing tightness in lending standards for the small- and medium-sized
enterprises. In this respect, the Committee, after taking liquidity conditions into
consideration, has taken the view hat a limited reduction in Turkish Lira
reserve requirements would alleviate the tightness in credit conditions, and
thus enhance the effectiveness of the expansionary monetary policy.
14. While the Committee members noted the improvements in credit and labor
markets, they have come to the conclusion that these developments alone

were not sufficient to end the easing cycle. Yet, given the increased
perceptions that the economy had passed its turning point, it was indicated
that a slowdown in the pace of the rate cuts would be considered in the next
meeting depending on the economic data and developments.
15. Although recent data releases indicate that the worst is likely to be over,
concerns regarding the health of the global economy remain. In particular,
ongoing problems in credit and labor markets pose downside risks for global
activity. Should the global conditions deteriorate again, and consequently
delay the domestic recovery, Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) would consider
another cycle of rate cuts. Lingering problems across the global economy are
not resolved completely and there are still uncertainties regarding the strength
of the recovery. Taking these factors into account, the Committee reiterated
that it would be necessary for the monetary policy to maintain an easing bias
for a long period of time.
16. Another possible scenario, according to the Committee members, is a surge in
capital inflows to emerging markets owing to the relative improvement of credit
risk across these countries. Ample liquidity driven by the expansionary fiscal
and monetary policies on a worldwide scale, coupled with rising risk appetites,
have led to large capital inflows to emerging markets. Current slack in the
economy would imply that a fall in the cost of imported inputs could be rapidly
transmitted to consumer prices, suggesting that a further acceleration in
capital inflows may exacerbate downward risks on inflation. Realization of
such a scenario could lead to temporarily lower policy rates.
17. The CBT will continue to monitor fiscal policy developments closely while
formulating monetary policy. Enhancing the framework set out in the Medium
Term Program (MTP) through further structural adjustments to strengthen
fiscal discipline, would support the improvement of Turkey’s sovereign risk.
Should the goals set out in the MTP be implemented, it would be possible to
keep policy rates at single digits throughout the forecast horizon.
18. The course of oil and other commodity prices constitutes another important
risk. Ample liquidity driven by countercyclical policies on a global scale creates
speculative movements not only regarding emerging market currencies, but
also for commodity prices. Therefore, oil and other commodity price
developments warrant caution, even under a scenario of a gradual global
economic recovery. Nonetheless, weak domestic demand conditions would
limit the pass-through stemming from upside cost-push shocks. Therefore, the
Committee will accommodate the short-term volatility in commodity prices,
especially when the resource utilization remains at depressed levels.
However, if an uptrend in commodity prices reflects a strong and durable
rebound in global activity that would in turn create inflationary pressures, then

monetary policy will react appropriately to keep inflation in line with mediumterm inflation targets.
19. The fact that the crisis itself, and the policy responses in reaction to it, are
unprecedented in recent history, creates risks regarding the inflation and
monetary policy outlook. It is extremely difficult estimate with precision the
impact of the recent monetary policy measures taken at the global scale.
Although not having resorted to explicit quantitative easing eliminates some of
the risks for the Turkish case, it should still be noted that the full impact of the
cumulative easing of 1000 basis points since November 2008 would be seen
with a lag. In other words, although baseline scenario does not envisage any
policy rate hikes for an extended period, it is important to monitor the impact of
the policies closely to ensure an appropriate timely response to any
development not envisaged in above assessments.
20. The CBT has been taking the necessary measures to contain the adverse
effects of the global financial turmoil on the domestic economy. However,
prudent monetary policy is necessary, but not sufficient to maintain the
resilience of the economy against the global crisis. Therefore, strengthening
the commitment to fiscal discipline and the structural reform agenda is also
critical for facilitating expectations management and thus for supporting the
effectiveness of the monetary policy decisions. In this respect, timely
implementation of the structural reforms envisaged by the Medium Term
Program and European Union accession process remains to be of utmost
importance.
