The Monetary Policy Committee has decided  to  raise short-term interest rates 
(policy rates)  at the CBRT Interbank Money Market and the Istanbul Stock Exchange 
Repo-Reverse Repo Market as follows : 
a) Overnight Interest Rates:  The CBRT borrowing interest rate is raised to 
17.25 percent from 15 percent, and the CBRT lending interest rate is rai sed to 20.25 
percent from 18 percent.  
b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates:  Within the framework of the Late 
Liquidity Window Facility, the CBRT overnight borrowing interest rat e applicable 
between 4:00 p.m. – 4:30 p.m. at Interbank Money Market is raised to 13.25 percent  
from 11 percent. Lending interest rate is raised to 23.25  percent from 21 percent. 
c) The interest rates applicable to overnight and one-week maturity  borrowing 
facilities provided for primary dealer banks via repo transactions w ithin the 
framework of open market transactions are raised to 19.25  percent from 17 percent. 
The Committee perceives that the volatility in international fina ncial markets, 
which has started in May, basically results from the serious shr inkage in demand for 
financial assets of developing countries due to portfolio movements trig gered by the 
process of monetary tightening and interest hikes in the developed countri es. This 
demand shrinkage has exerted pressure on both foreign exchange rates a nd medium 
and short-term interest rates in developing countries, especially i n the last three days, 
beyond the extent implied by economic fundamentals. Turkey has significa ntly been 
influenced by these developments because of the structure of the portfoli o held by 
non-residents.   
Recent volatility has the potential to affect the expectations a nd the risk 
perceptions, and thus the inflation. The Central Bank will not allow this  to happen.  In 
this context, the Central Bank will start deposit-buying auctions in order to reduce the 
excess New Turkish Lira liquidity in overnight money market via open market 
transactions with the aim of increasing the effectiveness of mone tary policy decisions. 
Governor Yılmaz has submitted the regulation, which has been drawn up for this 
purpose, to the Committee. Moreover, the liquidity conditions in the foreign excha nge 
markets have been thoroughly assessed and shrinkage in foreign exchange liquidity 
was identified. Due to the fact that an effective operating forei gn exchange market is 
a precondition for price stability, the Committee has expressed it s full support for the effective intervention of the Central Bank Head-Office in order to provide foreign 
exchange liquidity via its tools and mechanisms. 
Furthermore, Monetary Policy Committee has reviewed policy rates  and has 
decided to further strengthen monetary tightening in order to improve me dium-term 
inflationary expectations. 
A broader and combined summary of the assessments of the Monetary Pol icy 
Committee of 20 June and 25 June will be published on 28 June 2006. Besides, 
starting from July, in order to contribute to the accurate comprehensi on of monthly 
inflation data, a technical note on inflation developments will be published within t wo 
days following the announcement of price indices. The Inflation Report as sessing the 
reflections of recent economic developments on the medium-term inflat ion outlook 
will be published on 28 July 2006.
