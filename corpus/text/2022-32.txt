The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo
auction rate) constant at 14 percent.
The escalating geopolitical risks has continued to be adversely realized and caused further
weakening in the worldwide economic activity. Global growth forecasts for the upcoming period
are being revised downwards and the likelihood of a recession has increased. Increasing concern
over global food security driven by trade restrictions, high and volatile course of commodity
prices, and the persistence of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly in food, have led to
producer and consumer price increases internationally. The effects of high global inflation on
inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. Moreover,
central banks in advanced economies emphasize that the rise in inflation may last longer than
previously anticipated due to rising energy prices, imbalances between supply and demand, and
rigidities in labor markets. The divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of
central banks in advanced economies continue due to their diverse economic outlook. It is
observed that central banks have increased and diversified their efforts to develop new
supportive measures and tools to cope with the increasing uncertainties in financial markets.
Robust growth in the beginning of the year continued in the second quarter as well, with the
support of external demand. Compared to peer economies, job creation has been stronger.
While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, the tourism-led
improvement in current account balance continues with a solid pace. On the other hand, high
course of energy prices and the likelihood of a recession in main trade partners keep the risks on
current account balance alive. Sustainable current account balance is important for price
stability. Despite losing momentum, credit growth, and allocation of funds for real economic
activity purposes are closely monitored. The Committee will continue to implement the
strengthened macroprudential policy set decisively and take additional measures when needed.
Increase in inflation is driven by rising energy costs resulting from geopolitical developments,
effects of pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, strong negative
supply shocks caused by the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices. The
Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken and decisively
implemented for strengthening sustainable price and financial stability along with the resolution
of the ongoing regional conflict. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate
unchanged. To create an institutional basis for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive
review of the policy framework continues with the aim of encouraging permanent and
strengthened liraization in all policy tools of the CBRT. The credit, collateral and liquidity policy
actions, of which the review process is finalized, will continue to be implemented to strengthen
the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.

The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively within the framework of
liraization strategy until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the mediumterm 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. Stability in
the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall
in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward
trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a
viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy
and sustainable way.
The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven
framework.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working
days.
