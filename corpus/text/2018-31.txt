Press Release on Financial Markets
13 August 2018, No: 2018-31
To support financial stability and sustain the effective functioning of markets, the following
measures have been introduced:
I. Turkish lira liquidity management:
1) In the framework of intraday and overnight standing facilities, the Central Bank will
provide all the liquidity the banks need.
2) Discount rates for collaterals against Turkish lira transactions will be revised based on type
and maturity, thus providing banks with flexibility in their collateral management. Through
this regulation, the discounted value of banks’ current unencumbered collaterals is
projected to increase by approximately 3,8 billion Turkish liras.
3) Collateral FX deposit limits for Turkish lira transactions of banks have been raised to 20
billion euros from 7,2 billion euros.
4) As cited in the Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy Text for 2018, when deemed
necessary, in addition to one-week repo auctions, which are the main funding instrument
of the Central Bank, traditional repo auctions or deposit selling auctions may be held with
maturities no longer than 91 days.
5) For the days with relatively higher funding need, more than one repo auction may be
conducted with maturities between 6 and 10 days.
6) To provide flexibility in banks’ collateral management, upon the request of banks, a
portion of or the entire amount of the winning bids in one-week repo auctions will be
allowed to be used in deposit transactions instead of repo transactions at the Central
Bank Interbank Money Market with the same interest rate and maturity.
II. FX liquidity management:
1) Banks will be able to borrow FX deposits in one-month maturity in addition to oneweek maturity.
2) The Central Bank will resume its intermediary function at the FX deposit market.
Accordingly, through the intermediation of the Central Bank, banks will be able to borrow
from and lend to each other at the FX deposit market as per the rules set by the
Implementation Instructions on the Foreign Exchange and Banknotes Markets.

exchange transactions within their pre-determined limits at the Foreign Exchange and

The Central Bank will closely monitor the market depth and price formations, and take all
necessary measures to maintain financial stability, if deemed necessary.
