SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 20 December 2016
Inflation Developments
1. In November, consumer prices went up by 0.52 percent, while annual consumer
inflation fell by 0.16 points to 7.0 percent. As stated in the Summary of the
Monetary Policy Committee Meeting of November, annual food inflation receded
considerably, while energy inflation increased due to the depreciation in the Turkish
lira. On the other hand, the effect of recent exchange rate movements on core
inflation indicators remained relatively limited due to the slowdown in aggregate
demand. Thus, the underlying trends of core indicators displayed a practically flat
course.
2. Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages fell by 1.65 points to 3.55
percent, which was led by the falling unprocessed food prices due to the decline in
the prices of vegetables. Annual processed food inflation remained on the decline.
Leading indicators regarding December suggest an uptick in annual food inflation on
account of the unprocessed food inflation. Energy prices increased by 1.05 points in
November and the depreciation in the Turkish lira resulted in overall price hikes in
the sector. Thus, annual energy inflation rose by 1.44 points to 6.15 percent. This
rise is expected to continue in December due to the uptrend in the exchange rate
coupled with oil prices. In addition to food and energy groups, recent tax
adjustments introduced to some items, chiefly tobacco products, is envisaged to put
a noticeable upside pressure on December inflation.

3. Prices of services recorded an uptick by 0.29 percent, and annual services inflation
crept up by 0.14 points to 7.94 percent in November. Annual inflation decreased in
transport and rent, but increased in other sub-groups in this period. Consequences
of the slowdown in domestic demand and the tourism sector were evident in the
prices of services, while some groups reflected the effect of depreciation of the

1

Turkish lira as well. In this respect, the underlying trend of services inflation
registered a slight increase.
4. Annual core goods inflation inched down by 0.22 points to 5.92 percent in
November. Inflation plummeted in the clothing group, but increased in durable
goods. Recent exchange rate developments had a limited effect on durable goods in
November. This month was marked by a notable depreciation in the Turkish lira,
while aggregate demand conditions confined the deterioration in the underlying
trend of core goods inflation.

5. In sum, the effect of the recent rise in exchange rate and oil prices on inflation
remained relatively limited due to aggregate demand conditions.

Factors Affecting Inflation
6. The GDP narrowed by 1.8 percent year-on-year in the third quarter and grew by 2.2
percent through the first nine months of 2016. The Committee assessed that the
underlying growth of economic activity is not as slow as third-quarter GDP data
suggest. In fact, mid-July incidents and the loss of working days caused by extended
religious holidays had far more implications than normal calendar effects. Adjusted
for such effects, the economy is estimated to register a year-on-year expansion
rather than a contraction in the third quarter.

7. In the third quarter, value-added was up in construction but down in agriculture,
industry and services on a yearly basis. On the spending front, public consumption
provided further support to growth. Meanwhile, construction investments
contributed to annual growth positively whereas machinery and equipment
investments and private spending declined. Domestic demand continued to prop up
growth, albeit to a lesser extent, while the effects of the tourism slump became
more pronounced and net exports provided an increased negative contribution to
growth.

8. Recent data indicate that economic activity rebounded somewhat in the fourth
quarter after the third-quarter deceleration. With working day losses led by
extended religious holidays counterbalanced and the underlying trend on a modest
upward track, industrial output increased in October. Data on the production and
exports of electricity and vehicles point to further growth in industrial output for
November. Thus, industrial production is likely to post a quarterly gain in the fourth
quarter thanks to the base effect from unworked days. However, apart from the

2

very much technical recovery driven by working day effects, the economy recovery
seems to be a moderate one yet to spread across all sectors.

9. Economic activity is expected to recover further amid accommodative incentives
and measures. This estimation is supported by the data on mortgage and auto
markets. Thanks to more accommodative monetary conditions and other newlyadopted measures, consumer loans have picked up in recent months, bolstering the
prospects for a gradual improvement. Moreover, the public sector is expected to
provide further investment support to growth in the coming months.

10. The growing EU demand continues to stimulate total exports, the auto industry in
particular. Turkey’s flexibility in market diversification continues to cushion exports
against the negative effects of geopolitical tensions on external demand.
Furthermore, the newly-restored relations with Russia translated into a boost for
exports. The gloomy tourism industry continues to have a negative impact on the
current account balance, which, however, is alleviated by the lagged pass-through of
terms-of-trade developments and the moderate course of loans. However,
commodity prices are expected to become gradually less accommodative for the
current account deficit in the upcoming period.

11. The labor market decline that began in May paused in September amid rising
nonfarm employment. The growth in nonfarm employment was mostly driven by
the increased construction employment. Meanwhile, services and industrial
employment picked up only modestly. Leading indicators such as new job vacancies
and unemployment insurance claims suggest that employment remains subdued
and unemployment rates will remain at high levels.

12. In sum, economic activity edged up in the fourth quarter and is expected to record a
moderate growth in 2016. However, the potential impact of recent global and
geopolitical developments on financial conditions and the lack of any signs of a rosy
tourism outlook remain a downside risk to the pace of economic recovery.

Monetary Policy and Risks
13. Consumer loans continue to improve amid falling interest rates and
macroprudential measures. Nevertheless, due to global and geopolitical spillovers
into domestic financial markets, commercial loans remain weak. Measures taken by

3

the Economic Coordination Committee to uplift the real sector are expected to help
commercial loans increase in the upcoming period.

14. The ongoing uncertainty over global monetary policies and enhanced Fed rate hike
prospects lead to financial market volatility and portfolio outflows in emerging
economies. To counteract their negative spillovers into exchange rates and lending
standards, the CBRT maintains a stabilizing stance for FX liquidity and a supportive
macroprudential policy stance.

15. Domestic demand is expected to start recovering by the fourth quarter amid
accommodative incentives and measures. Yet, global market turmoil and
geopolitical risks keep a firm lid on the pace of economic recovery. Thus, economic
activity is likely to grow moderately in the upcoming period. The CBRT will continue
to monitor the developments in economic activity and their implications for price
stability and financial stability. The Committee stated that adopting structural
reforms might boost the economy’s growth potential to a large extent.

16. Exchange rate movements and rising oil prices fueled by the recently heightened
global uncertainty pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook. Recent price
movements and current weather forecasts add to the upside risks to food prices for
the coming months, which, however, are curbed by aggregate demand. The
Committee agreed that future developments should be closely monitored to
determine the net effects of these factors on the inflation outlook for 2017.

17. Against this background, the Committee kept the marginal funding rate constant in
December and maintains its position that the simplification should be completed
within an appropriate time frame. The gains that were planned through
simplification are performing to a great extent. The direction and the timing of the
next step toward simplification will depend on the developments in inflation and
financial stability.

18. Monetary policy decisions will depend on the inflation outlook in the upcoming
period. The CBRT will maintain its cautious stance in light of future developments in
inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation.

19. Developments in fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard
to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is
formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there

4

will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices. A revision of the monetary
policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from
this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term
inflation outlook.

20. In recent years, sustaining fiscal discipline has become one of the major factors in
reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks. In the
current environment of high global uncertainty, it is critical to maintain and further
enhance these achievements. Any measure to provide permanent fiscal discipline
and to reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and
contribute positively to social welfare by keeping the interest rates of long-term
government securities at low levels.
