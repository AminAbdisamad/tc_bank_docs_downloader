As stipulated in the Article 42 of the Central Bank Law, in the case of a significant
breach of the inflation target, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (the Central Bank) is
accountable for reporting to the Government and announcing to the public the reasons behind
the breach of the target and the necessary measures to be taken. As stated in the main policy
document titled “Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy in 2014”, which was published on
December 24, 2013; the inflation target for 2014 was set jointly with the Government as 5
percent. In the same document, it was also indicated that the Central Bank would write an open
letter to the Government should end-year inflation exceed the target significantly (by more than
2 percentage points in either direction). Inflation reached 8.17 percent at end-2014, notably
exceeding the target. This text elaborates on the reasons why the target was missed and explains
the measures already taken—and to be taken—to bring inflation back to the target.
Factors Affecting Inflation in 2014
In the first Inflation Report of 2014 (IR 2014/I), the mid-point of the year-end inflation
forecast was given as 6.6 percent. However, deviations from the underlying assumptions over
the year and developments affecting the dynamics of inflation caused inflation to end the year
above the uncertainty band.
The main factors causing inflation to exceed the target in 2014 are the cumulative
increases in the exchange rate since mid-2013 and soaring food prices caused by adverse
weather conditions. The food and exchange rate-driven prolonged pressures not only had direct
impacts on inflation but also affected underlying inflation trend through the expectations
channel. Adjustments to administered prices and taxes also had some impact, albeit limited, on
the deviation from the inflation target in this period.

Emerging market currencies have depreciated dramatically since mid-2013 amid
heightened uncertainty over global monetary policies. The depreciation of the Turkish lira has
affected core inflation, especially through prices of core goods. The high level of the
accumulated increases in exchange rate had spillover effects on food and services as well.
Although the ongoing moderate course of import prices was supported by decreasing
international oil prices in the second half of 2014, exchange rate developments added about 1.5
points to end-2014 inflation.
Another factor causing inflation to remain above the projected level was the course of
food prices. The annual food inflation, which was assumed as 8 percent at the start of the year,
climbed to 12.7 percent at the end of the year. This was mainly attributed to hikes in both
unprocessed and processed food prices, which caused inflation to deviate from the target by 1.2
points. In 2014, the net effect of administered prices, such as electricity, natural gas, alcoholic
beverage and tobacco prices, on inflation exceeded the levels consistent with the forecasts
presented in the January Inflation Report by 0.3 points.
As a result, while domestic demand and loan growth were contained by a tight monetary
stance and macroprudential measures, inflation ended 2014 above the target due to exchange
rate and food price developments as well as adjustments to administered prices. However, the
downward trend in oil prices during the second half of 2014 has been a major factor to support
the projected disinflation in 2015.
Measures Taken to Attain the Inflation Target
In order to contain any risks to the inflation outlook and macro-financial stability
stemming from the noticeable increases in exchange rates and risk premiums caused by the
deteriorated risk sentiment since end-2013, the Central Bank implemented a strong and frontloaded monetary tightening on 28 January 2014. In this regard, overnight borrowing and
lending rates and weekly repo rates were raised substantially, while short-term market rates
were hiked on par with policy rates (Chart 1). Following this strong tightening, the risk
sentiment improved, the Turkish lira depreciation was partially offset and the relative exchange
rate volatility decreased. These measures aimed to limit the negative effects on medium-term
inflation expectations and the pricing behavior.
Considering the improvement both in global liquidity conditions and the risk premia and
waning uncertainties in the succeeding period, the Central Bank implemented measured
reductions in the 1-week repo rate and the overnight lending rate in the May-August period.

Sustaining the emphasis on inflation expectations and the pricing behavior, the Central
Bank maintained its tight monetary policy stance by keeping the yield curve flat in this period.
Liquidity policy was tightened against elevated geopolitical risks and the volatility in financial
markets starting from September 2014 and the BIST overnight repo rates were kept around the
upper limit of the interest rate corridor (Chart 1). The tight monetary policy stance prevents
potential excessive volatilities in the Turkish lira and has a lowering effect on the long-term
interest rates through reducing the expected inflation.

To enhance the resilience of the Turkish economy against potential external shocks and
to restrict the adverse effects of global uncertainties on inflation and macroeconomic stability,
encouraging prudential borrowing is of great importance along with the improvements in
inflation and the current account deficit. Accordingly, it is crucial that core liabilities are
supported and maturities of external borrowing are extended. To this end, (i) to foster core
liabilities, starting from 2015, the Central Bank decided to remunerate financial institutions
with higher core liability ratios (ratio of deposits and equity to loans) than the sector average at
a higher rate provided that they do not worsen their situation; and (ii) reserve requirement ratios
of FX-denominated non-core liabilities of banks and financing firms were raised in a way to
prompt the extension of maturities on 3 January 2015. Moreover, to strengthen the automatic
stabilizing feature of the ROM, technical adjustments were made in reserve option tranches and
coefficients.

The tight monetary policy stance and the macroprudential measures taken in early 2014
continue to have a positive effect on the core inflation trend. Reverting to the levels recorded
before mid-2013, the time of the appearance of the exchange rate depreciation and unfavorable
weather conditions, the core inflation trend approached the levels consistent with the target at
end-2014 (Chart 2). In addition, receding oil prices underpinned disinflation, and inflation
expectations have recently recorded a notable improvement. In 2015, a remarkable decline in
inflation is projected due to the fading effects of cumulative exchange rate changes, the
reverting of food inflation to past years’ averages as well as the falling commodity prices,
chiefly oil. Accordingly, inflation is projected to move towards the target in mid-2015.
Against this background, inflation is expected to reach the 5-percent target in the third
quarter of 2015, but slightly increase to 5.5 percent in the last quarter due to base effects (Chart
3). Inflation is expected to stabilize around 5 percent as of 2016. The risks to the inflation
outlook are analyzed in the January 2015 Inflation Report.

Conclusion
Inflation exceeded the target in 2014 due to the developments in the exchange rate and
food prices besides the adjustments in administered prices. The Central Bank responded to the
increase in inflation by a tight monetary policy stance, which was accompanied by the liquidity
policy, when required. Effects of the enforced measures appeared as of the second half of 2014.
The underlying trend in inflation has recently recorded a remarkable fall and there has been an
evident improvement in expectations. In addition to the monetary policy and macroprudential

measures, the fast decline in oil prices will considerably support disinflation in 2015.
Accordingly, inflation is expected to display a notable decline and move towards the 5-percent
target in 2015. The Central Bank will continue to monitor developments influencing the
inflation outlook and take the necessary measures to retain the achievements on price stability.

developments regarding inflation and monetary policy as well as our medium-term forecasts, is
