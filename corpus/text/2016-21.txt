SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 24 May 2016
Inflation Developments
1. In April, consumer prices rose by 0.78 percent, and annual inflation dropped by 0.89
points to 6.57 percent. Consumer inflation declined further on the back of
unprocessed food prices. In this period, annual inflation in core indicators remained
high, while their underlying trend continued to improve.
2. Annual inflation in the food and non-alcoholic beverages group fell by 3.20 points to
1.38 percent. The deceleration in food inflation was mainly driven by unprocessed
food prices, the annual inflation of which plunged to -5.94 percent. In this group,
prices of fresh fruits and vegetables remained below the previous year’s levels due to
increased supply of products, whereas red meat prices exhibit a mild outlook amid
the measures in effect. On the other hand, processed food inflation sustained its high
course also due to prices in the bread-cereals group. On the energy front, prices rose
by 0.34 percent in line with international oil prices, while annual inflation sustained
the mild outlook with 1.74 percent.
3. Prices of services increased by 0.64 percent, and the annual services inflation edged
down by 0.10 point to 8.76 percent in April. Being the culprit of high figures in
services inflation, the restaurants-hotels and other services groups lost pace in the
last couple of months. The mild course in food prices reflected favorably on prices in
the restaurants-hotels group, and the attenuated cumulative depreciation in the
Turkish lira underpins the slowdown in inflation in other services. On the other hand,
inflation in transport services continued with an uptrend and rent inflation rose to
8.39 percent. All in all, despite some deceleration, the underlying trend of services
prices remained high.
4. Annual core goods inflation remained flat with 10.11 percent in April. Annual
inflation recorded an increase in the clothing group, but edged down in others. Prices
of durable goods registered a modest monthly increase by 0.43 percent, yet the
uptrend in subgroups like furniture and white goods proved notable. The underlying
trend of core goods weakened further, and when clothing is excluded, the

improvement is more remarkable. Amid the decelerating cumulative exchange rate
effects, annual core goods inflation is projected to slow in the second half of the year.
5. In sum, inflation has recently recorded a notable decline driven mainly by the
unprocessed food prices. Despite the fall in inflation, the Committee stated that the
improvement in the underlying core inflation trend remains limited.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6. Data for the first quarter of 2016 suggest that economic activity remains on the rise.
Up by 1.5 percent from the previous quarter’s average, industrial production
recorded the largest increase since the first quarter of 2014. Production of basic
pharmaceuticals made the greatest contribution to quarterly growth, while main
industries such as food, clothing and textiles also contributed to growth, which is a
favorable development. In addition, the steady increase in the exports to the EU is
another factor supporting industrial production growth.
7. Data on spending side point to a rising domestic demand for the first quarter. Among
indicators of private consumption, the production and imports of consumer goods
grew robustly. Likewise, sales of automobiles, home appliances and homes were up
in the first quarter. On the investment side, the production of capital goods dropped
whereas their imports increased. The production of capital goods declined due to
vehicle manufacturing, yet vehicles excluded, it posted a rise. Moreover, both the
warmer-than-normal weather in winter months and the upsurge in the production
and imports of nonmetallic minerals suggest some increase in construction activities
for the first quarter. Against this background, it is assessed that private consumer
spending was more robust than investments, and private consumption was the main
driver of domestic demand in the first quarter.
8. Favorable developments in the terms of trade accompanied by the moderate course
of consumer loans support the recovery in the current account balance. The growing
EU demand continues to support exports. High market-shifting flexibility of exports
limits downside risks caused by geopolitical developments. Thus, amid continued EU
demand growth, low commodity prices and ongoing macroprudential policies, the
current account balance is expected to improve further. Yet, the falling number of
foreign visitors weighs on revenues from services, posing a downside risk to the
current account deficit.
9. Seasonally-adjusted unemployment rates were down month-on-month in February
2016, due to the weakening labor supply and the moderate gain in nonfarm
employment. Across sub-sectors, services provided the largest contribution to
nonfarm employment growth, while construction employment continued to expand.
Meanwhile, industrial employment continued to drop slightly in February. In view of
production and survey indicators, employment is expected to remain on a modest
track in the short term. This labor market outlook is likely to spur growth in 2016.

10. In sum, current indicators suggest that the economy continues to grow at a moderate
and steady pace. In the upcoming period, the income channel is likely to push
domestic demand higher through wage increases and a food price-driven decline in
headline inflation. Although geopolitical developments continue to pose downside
risks, the growing EU demand continues to support exports, and thus production.
Monetary Policy and Risks
11. Annual loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary
policy stance and macroprudential measures. Risk weight and minimum wage
arrangements are expected to boost loan growth further in the upcoming period via
loan supply and household income channels. Thus, annual loan growth rates are
likely to remain at reasonable levels. With respect to the composition of loans,
commercial loans continue to grow faster than consumer loans. This composition not
only limits medium-term inflationary pressures but also supports the improvement in
the current account balance.
12. Economic activity remains on a moderate and steady growth track. In the first
quarter, industrial production recorded a robust quarter-on-quarter increase while
external demand supported growth. In the forthcoming period, domestic demand is
expected to provide further support to growth while the rising EU demand will
continue to promote exports. Employment remained on a moderate upward path in
the first quarter. Given wage developments, employment growth is likely to support
domestic demand further through the income channel. On the external demand side,
geopolitical tensions and the weakening global growth continued to pose risks, and
risks to services exports became prevalent. However, the European economic
recovery and the market-shifting flexibility of exports alleviate the downside risks to
external balance. Moreover, the favorable impact of the cumulative fall in
commodity prices on the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans
contribute to the improvement in the current account balance.
13. Recently, the global volatility has increased to some extent amid ongoing concerns
over global growth and continued uncertainty about global monetary policies.
Accordingly, emerging-market portfolio flows slowed slightly while risk premiums and
exchange rate volatilities recorded increases. The Committee assesses that the tight
monetary policy stance, the cautious macroprudential policies and the effective use
of the policy instruments laid out in the road map published in August 2015 enhance
the resilience of the economy against shocks. These policy measures have tamed the
heightened volatility in both exchange rates and loans. In fact, the Turkish lira has
followed a relatively less volatile path than other emerging market currencies since
September 2015. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to take a measured
step towards simplification by lowering the marginal funding rate. Moreover, within
the context of the road map, related departments made presentations about the
arrangements that would increase the predictability of liquidity policy and make
liquidity management of banks more efficient.

14. On the other hand, the improvement in the underlying core inflation trend remains
limited, necessitating the maintenance of the tight liquidity policy stance. Although
low imported-input costs have eased the upside risks to the inflation outlook, the
improvement in core inflation is still limited. The weakening yet ongoing lagged
effects of cumulative exchange rate movements, high levels of inflation expectations
and wage developments restrain the improvement in the underlying trend of
inflation. Food inflation has recently seen a marked decline on the back of
unprocessed food prices. The falling food inflation led to a decrease in consumer
inflation as well. Yet, given the elevated core inflation, it is important to remain
cautious about the inflation outlook. To this end, the Committee stated that the
current tight liquidity stance should be maintained in order to ensure that the
recently observed disinflation becomes permanent.
15. In the upcoming period, the monetary policy stance will be conditional on the
inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and
the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be
maintained. Moreover, global and domestic volatilities will be monitored closely and
necessary measures will be taken for the foreign exchange and Turkish lira markets.
In sum, the policy stance will remain tight against the inflation outlook, stabilizing for
the FX liquidity and supportive of financial stability.
16. Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with
regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance
is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there
will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices. A revision of the monetary
policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from
this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term
inflation outlook.
17. Sustained fiscal discipline has become a fundamental element in reducing the
sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years. In the
current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the value added from
maintaining and further advancing these achievements is significant. Any measure
that would ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings
deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social
welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels.
