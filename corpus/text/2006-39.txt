SUMMARY OF MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE DISCUSSIONS
Meeting Date: 20 July 2006

Inflation Developments
1. The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (Central Bank) has started to
publish a technical note focusing on inflation developments within two days of
the announcement of price indices with the aim of contributing to the better
understanding of monthly inflation data. In this framework, as was stated in
the press release dated July 4, 2006, the decline in prices of unprocessed food
along with the rise in prices of consumer durables and energy prices due to
developments observed in exchange rates became the determining factors for
inflation in June. Thus, the impact of exchange rates on annual inflation in the
last two months reached 1.5 percentage points.
2. It is estimated that the effect of exchange rates on prices will continue to be
felt strongly in July and eventually start to diminish as of August. However, as
it will take more than a year to mop up the effects of supply-oriented
developments observed in the last few months on annual inflation, annual
inflation will continue to be high in the short-term. The measures taken by the
Central Bank in June will ease pressures on inflation in the upcoming period.
3. Annual inflation of the CPI excluding energy, unprocessed food, alcoholic
beverages, tobacco products and gold, which is calculated in order to measure
the general inflation trend, increased compared to the previous month and
reached 6.1 percent, while the monthly rise became 0.54 percentage points,
when seasonally adjusted. It is estimated that this rate will continue to increase
in July also.
4. Effects of the recent movements of exchange rates on inflation can be handled
in two categories as primary and secondary effects. Primary effects cover
mostly price adjustments in prices of goods with a high imported component.
These effects, which are observed as the relative price discrepancy between
tradable goods and non-tradable goods, can lead to a temporary rise in
inflation. However, such effects do not change the medium-term inflation
trend, as they do not disrupt the general pricing behavior. Therefore, central
banks that act on medium term perspective do not give policy responses to
these primary effects.
5. The secondary effects emerge when the rising tendency of prices is not limited
to goods with imported components, but is spread to the entire economy. Such
an effect, which might lead to an uninterrupted rise in the general price level,
may mean that the rise in inflation is permanent and in such a case reducing
inflation again would be too costly. Therefore, while evaluating the effects of
exchange rates and oil prices on inflation, central banks attach great
importance to the secondary effects.

6. The secondary effects arise mainly through expectations. Therefore, the recent
developments in inflation expectations have become more significant. The
supply-oriented shocks that had significant pressure on inflation along with the
rapid depreciation of the national currency have disrupted inflation
expectations. In other words, the risk of disrupting pricing behavior of the
entire economy has emerged. No significant improvement was observed in
medium-term expectations as of the first half of July. Even if it is expected
that the recent decisions of the Committee will contribute to improving
expectations and curbing secondary effects, there is still the need to adopt a
cautious stance.
Outlook and Factors Affecting Inflation
7. By increasing the tendency to avoid risks, the recent fluctuations in financial
markets are naturally reducing banksâ€™ appetites to provide credits. Moreover,
the rise in short-term interest rates that also boosted the costs of funding stands
as a factor that could tighten the supply of credit. The Central Bank sterilized
the excess liquidity in the market via weekly and bi-weekly New Turkish lira
(YTL) deposit purchase auctions as well as via foreign exchange sales
auctions, which led to a decrease in the amount of funds banks can convert to
credits. This development stands as another factor that might tighten the
supply of credit.
8. The rise in credit interest rates in the recent period leads to a decline in the
amount of credit demanded. The slowdown in credits, which is expected to be
observed in line with the rise in interest rates, emerges with a time lag due to
the rigidities in financial contracts. Nevertheless, considering the recent credit
developments, it can be said that the rate of increase in consumer credits tends
to slow down. In light of currently available information, the slowdown in the
rate of increase in credits is expected to become more significant in the
upcoming period.
9. Recent developments in financial markets have once again underlined the
significance of proper risk management by banks, households and firms under
the floating exchange rate regime. In the forthcoming period, the Central Bank
will continue to closely monitor banking and credit developments in terms of
both financial stability and price stability.
10. Along with the slowdown in credits, the upcoming three-month tendency of
domestic market orders and sales indicators from the Business Tendency
Survey (BTS) also showed declines in May. Supporting these indicators,
domestic sales of automobiles rapidly decreased in June compared to the
previous month. Besides, the Consumer Confidence Index also registered a
decline.
11. Meanwhile, it is anticipated that net foreign demand will follow a strong
course and especially the activity in the production of the export-oriented
private manufacturing industry will continue strong due to continued global
growth and the depreciation of the YTL. The fact that the Real Sector
Confidence Index has not registered a significant decline by June and the
capacity utilization rates especially in exports-oriented sectors remained at
high levels during the same period also supports this anticipation.

12. As a result, although the Committee projects that domestic demand will lose
pace in the second half of the year due to the fluctuations observed in financial
markets in May and June and the monetary policy decisions taken, it also
expects the strong course of net foreign demand to restrain the slowdown in
the economic activity. Nonetheless, taking the economic activity as a whole in
view of sectors sensitive to domestic demand such as the services sector, it is
anticipated that the decrease in domestic demand will be more determined
than the increase in net foreign demand, and thus the contribution of demand
conditions to the disinflation process will continue in an accelerated manner in
the second half of the year.
13. The fact that no significant decline was observed in investment tendency in
the recent period is seen as a favorable development in terms of the
continuation of productivity increases. This outlook is anticipated to help keep
the secondary effects of exchange rate movements limited. However, there is
still a need to remain cautious regarding inflation given that the oil and other
commodity prices are still increasing and the expectations are not yet in line
with the medium-term targets.
14. Being focused on the 2007 year-end inflation target and taking all these
factors into account, the Committee decided to move toward a measured
tightening of monetary policy and raised policy rates by 0.25 basis points. In
light of the existing risks, the Committee considers that the cautious stance is
very likely to continue for some time. Under this cautious stance, the
downward trend in inflation is expected to be significant in the second quarter
of 2007.
15. There is no doubt that the control of the secondary effects mentioned above
will depend mainly on the continuation of fiscal discipline and structural
reforms. In particular, in order to attain medium-term targets it is of critical
importance that medium-term inflation targets are taken into account in the
incomes policy and that the need for unprogrammed public price and tax
adjustments is precluded by respecting the limits of budgetary expenditures.
Risks
16. The probability of crude oil prices climbing further continues to be an
important risk factor for inflation. As before, the Central Bank will not
respond to the primary effects of increases in oil prices. However, it is also
true that, along with the deterioration of expectations recently, it became
necessary to be more cautious about the secondary effects of oil prices. Should
the developments in oil prices affect medium-term inflation expectations
adversely or start to disrupt pricing behavior, necessary policy measures will
be taken.
17. The main development that marked the economic conjuncture in the recent
period is the fluctuations in financial markets, which emerged due to the
change in international liquidity conditions. Central banks of developed
countries may continue the tightening process because of the concerns about
inflation and the extent of further tightening is not clear at this point. This
outlook has increased the uncertainties in the global liquidity conditions. The
rapid changes in global risk appetite and the possible fluctuations in the global

liquidity continue to be one of the major risk factors for inflation. In case such
a risk occurs, the Central Bank will act with a medium-term perspective: It
will not respond to the temporary increase in inflation induced by the changes
in relative prices, however it will closely monitor medium-term inflation
expectations, as it did recently.
18. Along with the decline in inflation in recent years, inflation targets have
increasingly become a benchmark variable for pricing decisions. However, the
deterioration of medium-term expectations after recent developments, presents
the risk of referring to a variable other than the inflation target, such as past
inflation, in pricing decisions. In case such a risk occurs, the Central Bank will
not hesitate to give the necessary response and will continue its cautious
stance until the medium-term inflation expectations of economic agents
converge to targets. In this context, the developments that might especially
affect expectations, such as international liquidity conditions, the course of
domestic demand, pricing behavior and the public sector income policy will be
monitored closely in the forthcoming period.
19. Under current conditions, it is of great importance for both price stability and
macroeconomic stability that any implementation that would damage risk
perceptions and expectations is avoided. Any step towards limiting the risk
perception would reduce the cost of attaining and continuing stability. It
should be borne in mind that the main determinant of the continuation of noninflationary growth is the confidence in the permanence of macroeconomic
stability. The continuation of a determined attitude towards structural reforms
that would increase the quality of fiscal discipline and the uninterrupted
implementation of reforms that would enhance the competition and investment
environment, and thus underpin increases in productivity in the long term, are
of critical importance. In this context, continuation of the European Union
accession process and uninterrupted implementation of structural reforms in
the economic reform program are crucial. The continuation of the determined
steps taken in recent years in this context will help the economy to overcome
the changes in the international conjecture with minimum cost.
