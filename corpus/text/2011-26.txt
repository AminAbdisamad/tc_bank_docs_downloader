DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Meeting Date: August 4, 2011
Participating Committee Members
Erdem Başçı (Governor), Turalay Kenç, Necati Şahin, M. Đbrahim Turhan,
Abdullah Yavaş, Mehmet Yörükoğlu.
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short
term interest rates as follows:
a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) has been decreased from 6.25 percent
to 5.75 percent,
b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate has been increased from 1.50
percent to 5 percent, lending rate has been kept at 9 percent, the interest rate on
borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been
kept at 8 percent,
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.):
Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, while lending rate has been kept at
12 percent.
Concerns regarding sovereign debt problems in some European economies and
the global growth outlook have continued to intensify, increasing the risks highlighted in
the July Committee meeting. In order to limit the potential downside volatility in the
short-term interest rates, the Committee has decided to narrow the interest rate corridor
by significantly increasing the overnight borrowing rate. In addition, the Committee has
approved a technical adjustment to increase the efficiency of the central bank liquidity
management and to facilitate a more balanced provision of liquidity across the system.
Moreover, the Committee has delivered a measured policy rate cut to reduce the
risk of a domestic recession that may be caused by the heightened problems in the
global economy.
The Committee has agreed to closely monitor the developments, and if
necessary, take measures to provide foreign exchange liquidity via appropriate methods
and instruments.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the
Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within
five working days.
