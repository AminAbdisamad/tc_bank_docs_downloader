PRESS RELEASE
ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE INTERVENTION
OF THE CENTRAL BANK

The Central Bank has announced through several press releases that under the
floating exchange rate regime the level of exchange rate is determined by supply and
demand conditions in the currency markets, the volatility in the exchange rate is
closely observed by the Central Bank, which may directly intervene in the markets in
the event of an excessive volatility that might occur in either directions. In this
framework, the Central Bank directly intervened in the markets by buying foreign
currency on 9 March 2005 due to excessive volatility in exchange rates.
The recently observed foreign exchange sales arising from the increasingly
optimistic expectations about the Turkish economy have led to excessive volatility in
exchange rates again. The volatility in the value of Turkish lira against the US dollar in
particular has become more apparent in the face of concurrent appreciation of the US
dollar in the international markets. Therefore, the Central Bank has decided to directly
intervene in the markets by buying foreign currency in order to prevent the excessive
volatility.
