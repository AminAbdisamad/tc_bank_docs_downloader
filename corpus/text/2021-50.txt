Press Release on Market
Developments
23 November 2021

No: 2021-50

The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey implements floating exchange rate regime and has no
commitment to any exchange rate level. Exchange rates are determined by supply and demand
conditions according to free market dynamics. Under certain conditions, the Central Bank may
only intervene in excessive volatility without aiming any permanent direction. In FX markets,
unhealthy price formations are being observed that are unrealistic and completely detached
from economic fundamentals.
The CBRT deemed it necessary to warn our companies and citizens against possible losses by
trading at values completely detached from economic fundamentals under extremely volatile
market conditions.
