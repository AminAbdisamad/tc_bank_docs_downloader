The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to keep overnight rates
unchanged as follows, and to implement the technical rate adjustment by setting the one week
repo auction rate at 7 percent:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 6.50 percent, lending rate at 9 percent,
b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing
rate at 2.50 percent, lending rate at 12 percent,
c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for
primary dealers via repo transactions at 8 percent.
Recent data suggest that the recovery in economic activity is ongoing. Domestic
demand is following a stable growth trend, while recent developments indicate that uncertainties
regarding external demand would last for a long period. Therefore, it would take a while before
industrial capacity utilization rates return to pre-crisis levels. Although employment conditions
continue to improve, unemployment rates remain at high levels.
The Committee indicated that core inflation would continue to remain at levels below the
end-year target. It was also noted that unprocessed food prices may display a significant fall in
May. However, it was stated that the significant gap between inflation expectations and the
medium term targets necessitates close monitoring of the pricing behavior.
The Committee stated that market liquidity conditions have evolved as envisaged, and
therefore, conditions are appropriate to implement the first step of the technical rate adjustment
described in the “Monetary Policy Exit Strategy” published on the 14th of April 2010. Observing
that current rates for one week repo auctions fluctuate around 7 percent, the Committee
decided to start conducting one week repo auctions via quantity auction with fixed interest rate,
in order to eliminate such fluctuations. In this respect, the one week repo rate, which becomes
the new policy rate, is set at 7 percent—50 basis points above the overnight borrowing rates, as
indicated in the exit strategy document.
Considering the lingering uncertainties regarding global economy, the Committee
reiterated that it may be necessary to maintain policy rates at current levels for some time, and
to keep them at low levels for a long period.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook
may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight
working days.
