DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Meeting Date: June 16, 2008
Committee Members
Durmuş Yılmaz (Governor), Erdem Başçı, Burhan Göklemez, M. İbrahim Turhan, Abdullah
Yavaş, Mehmet Yörükoğlu.
The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to increase the policy
rates as follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate from 15.75 percent to 16.25 percent, and
lending rate from 19.75 percent to 20.25 percent,
b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00
p.m. from 11.75 percent to 12.25 percent, lending rate from 22.75 percent to 23.25
percent,
c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided
for primary dealers via repo transactions from 18.75 percent to 19.25 percent.
Recent readings on the supply and demand conditions are largely in line with the
predictions of the April Inflation Report. Difficulties in international credit markets continue
to restrain the domestic demand, while external demand displays a relatively strong
course. Overall, aggregate demand conditions will support disinflation.
The Committee notes that recently there have been favorable developments in
unprocessed food prices, while oil prices have followed a significantly higher course than
the prices assumed in the baseline scenario in the April Inflation Report. Consequently,
inflation is expected to decelerate starting from the last quarter of the year, ending 2009
close to the 7.5 percent inflation target. Adverse impacts of the supply side shocks on the
economy will be more limited should the economic agents align their expectations for the
next three years with the target rates of 7,5 percent, 6.5 percent and 5.5 percent,
respectively.
Ongoing uncertainties and supply side shocks continue to pose risks on inflation.
The Central Bank will consider a further measured rate hike when needed, so as to prevent
the potential second-round effects of such risk factors. The extent and timing of a
possible future rate hike will depend on developments in global markets, external demand,
fiscal policy implementation, and other factors affecting the medium term inflation outlook.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation
outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight
working days.
