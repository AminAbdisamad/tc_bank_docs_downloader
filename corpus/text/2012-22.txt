PRESS RELEASE ON THE FACILITY OF MAINTAINING RESERVE
REQUIREMENTS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE
In accordance with the decision taken by the Central Bank of the Republic of
Turkey (CBRT) on 27 October 2011, the upper limit for FX reserves that might be
held to meet Turkish lira reserve requirements was raised from 20 percent to 40
percent with a view to meeting the TL liquidity requirement of the Turkish banking
system permanently and at a lower cost, as well as bolstering the build-up of the
Central Bank’s FX reserves. Since then, the banks have benefited from this facility
considerably and steadily, with an across-the-sector utilization ratio around 90
percent.
This time, the upper limit of the above-mentioned facility has been raised to 45
percent, and the banks are allowed to hold Turkish lira reserve requirements in US
dollar and/or euro over the total amount calculated by multiplying the first tranche
corresponding to 40 percent of Turkish lira reserve requirements by a coefficient of
“1”, as previously, and the second tranche corresponding to 5 percent of Turkish lira
reserve requirements multiplied by a coefficient of “1.4”.
The aim is to narrow the cost differential of meeting the Turkish lira reserve
requirements in Turkish lira or in FX, and enable the banks to benefit fully from the
facility as called for by their liquidity needs. Banks will be using this additional tranche
of FX liquidity if and when need arises in the future.
At present, USD 10.9 billion is being held for Turkish lira reserve requirements.
With the additional facility being used in a similar fashion, the expected figures for the
increase in Bank’s FX reserves and the amount of permanent liquidity to be provided
to the market are approximately USD 2.1 billion and TL 2.8 billion, respectively. The
new regulation will be effective as of the calculation period dated 8 June 2012 and
the maintenance period will begin on 22 June 2012.
