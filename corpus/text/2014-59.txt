The Sixth Meeting of the Financial Stability Board Regional
Consultative Group for the Middle East and North Africa
Today, the Central Bank of Jordan hosted the sixth meeting of the FSB Regional
Consultative Group for the Middle East and North Africa (RCG-MENA) in Dead Sea,
Jordan.
At the meeting, the members of the RCG-MENA were updated on the FSB’s work plan
and the progress made in the four core areas of financial regulatory reforms: building
resilient financial institutions, “ending too-big-to-fail”, transforming shadow banking,
and making derivatives markets safer. In regard to the “ending too-big-to-fail”,
members discussed recovery and resolution of financial market infrastructures with
particular reference to implementation challenges for the MENA region. The
discussion also focused, from the MENA region perspective, on the issues in crossborder cooperation and information sharing for resolution purposes.
Members discussed salient global macro-economic and macro-financial
developments and their potential financial stability implications for the MENA region
in the context of vulnerabilities in the global financial system and regional financial
stability. Members also exchanged views on and shared experiences in reducing
mechanistic reliance on the ratings of the credit rating agencies, and the plans for
reducing such reliance. The role of supervisory capacity building for enhancing risk
governance practices in financial institutions in the region was yet another theme of
discussion. Members also deliberated on the impact of regulatory reforms on the
long-term investments, with a focus on encouraging non-bank, market-based
alternative financing mechanisms for promoting long-term investments.
The RCG-MENA co-chairs Erdem Başçı, Governor, Central Bank of the Republic of
Turkey and Riad Salame, Governor, Central Bank of Lebanon will report on these
discussions at the upcoming FSB Plenary meeting. The current membership of the

Notes to editors
The FSB Charter stipulates that the FSB “should consult widely amongst its Members
and with other stakeholders including private sector and non-member authorities.
This process shall include engaging with the FSB Regional Consultative Groups and
include an outreach to countries not included in the Regional Consultative Groups”1.
At the Toronto Summit in June 2010, the G20 Leaders endorsed such a process by
calling on the FSB “to expand upon and formalize its outreach activities beyond the
membership of the G-20 to reflect the global nature of our financial system”2.
Responding to the call, the FSB established, in 2011, six Regional Consultative
Groups3 to bring together financial authorities from FSB member and non-member
countries to exchange views on vulnerabilities affecting financial systems and on
initiatives to promote financial stability.
The FSB has been established to coordinate at the international level the work of
national financial authorities and international standard setting bodies and to
develop and promote the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory and
other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together
national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions,
international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of
regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. Through the six
regional groups, the FSB will be able to develop global financial policy initiatives
through a more inclusive process.
The FSB is chaired by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England. Its Secretariat is
located in Basel, Switzerland, and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.
