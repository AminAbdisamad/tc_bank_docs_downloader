TURKISH LIRA DEPOSIT BUYING AUCTTONS PROGRAM FOR OCTOBER

In October, CBRT will continue to conduct Turkish lira deposit buying auctions
with a standard maturity of 4 weeks that it has initiated in April 2002 as a supplement
to its existing instruments with the aim of enhancing the effectiveness of its efforts to
sterilize the excess Turkish lira liguidity in the system.

Similar with September applications, the CBRT will hold Turkish lira deposit
buying auctions on Wednesdays and Fridays each week and the maximum amount to

be auctioned at each auction will be limited to 200 trillion Turkish liras.
