_______________________________________________________________
The Monetary Policy Committee (Committee) has decided to keep short-term
interest rates (policy rates) unchanged in the Inter-bank Money Market and
the Istanbul Stock Exchange Repo-Reverse Repo Market as follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: The overnight borrowing interest rate is 17.50
percent, and the overnight lending interest rate is 22.50 percent.
b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Within the framework of the Late
Liquidity Window Facility, the overnight borrowing interest rate valid between
4:00 p.m. – 4:30 p.m. in the Inter-bank Money Market is 13.50 percent, while
the lending interest rate is 25.50 percent.
c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities
provided for primary dealer banks via repo transactions within the framework
of open market transactions is 21.50 percent.
The recently available data suggest that inflation outlook has continued to
improve. Leading indicators confirm our earlier conjecture that total demand
would slow down, albeit not as significantly. Although domestic demand
indicators point to a significant slowdown, foreign demand remains relatively
strong. Following the policy measures taken by the CBRT in June, inflation
expectations continued to improve in September. Furthermore, the recent
deceleration in the price increases in items such as energy, unprocessed
food, alcoholic beverages-tobacco and gold has had a positive impact on
annual inflation figures. However, factors such as the mismatch between the
medium-term inflation expectations and the targets, and the continuation of
uncertainties in both commodity prices and international liquidity conditions
necessitate the monetary policy to remain cautious.
In light of these developments, the Committee assesses that maintaining the
cautious stance for a while is necessary for the inflation rate to converge to
the 2007 year-end targets. The policy rate is expected to remain close to the
CBRT borrowing rate in the upcoming months. The CBRT will not hesitate to
implement further tightening, in case there are developments that would
suggest an unfavorable medium-term inflation outlook.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information on inflation outlook
will potentially lead the Committee to revise its future stance.
A brief summary of the assessments of the Committee will be released within
five working days.
