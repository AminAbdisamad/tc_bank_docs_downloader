The Monetary Policy Committee (Committee) has decided  to  keep  short-term 
interest rates (policy rates)  unchanged in the Inter-bank Money Market and 
the Istanbul Stock Exchange Repo-Reverse Repo Market as fo llows: 
a) Overnight Interest Rates:  The overnight borrowing interest rate is 17.50 
percent, and the overnight lending interest rate is 22.50 percent.  
b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates:  Within the framework of the Late 
Liquidity Window Facility, the overnight borrowing i nterest rate valid between 
4:00 p.m. – 4:30 p.m. in the Inter-bank Money Market is 13.50 percent, while 
the lending interest rate is 25.50 percent.  
c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturit y borrowing facilities 
provided for primary dealer banks via repo transactions within the framework 
of open market transactions is 21.50 percent. 
The recently available data suggest that inflation out look has continued to 
improve. Leading indicators confirm our earlier conjectu re that total demand 
would slow down, albeit not as significantly. Although domestic demand 
indicators point to a significant slowdown, foreign dema nd remains relatively 
strong. Following the policy measures taken by the CBRT in June, inflation 
expectations continued to improve in September. Furthe rmore, the recent 
deceleration in the price increases in items such as energy,  unprocessed 
food, alcoholic beverages-tobacco and gold has had a posit ive impact on 
annual inflation figures. However, factors such as the mi smatch between the 
medium-term inflation expectations and the targets, an d the continuation of 
uncertainties in both commodity prices and international  liquidity conditions 
necessitate the monetary policy to remain cautious.  
In light of these developments, the Committee assesses tha t maintaining the 
cautious stance for a while is necessary for the inflation rate to converge to 
the 2007 year-end targets. The policy rate is expected to remain close to the 
CBRT borrowing rate in the upcoming months. The CBRT will not hesitate to 
implement further tightening, in case there are devel opments that would 
suggest an unfavorable medium-term inflation outlook. 
It should be emphasized that any new data or informat ion on inflation outlook 
will potentially lead the Committee to revise its fut ure stance.  
A brief summary of the assessments of the Committee will be released within 
five working days.
