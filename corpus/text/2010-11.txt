Meeting Date: April 13, 2010

The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to keep policy
rates unchanged as follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 6.50 percent, lending rate at 9
percent,
b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.):
Borrowing rate at 2.50 percent, lending rate at 12 percent,
c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities
provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 8 percent.
Recent data releases suggest that the recovery in economic activity is ongoing.
Domestic demand is following a gradual growth trend despite lingering uncertainty
regarding external demand, suggesting that it would take a while before industrial
capacity utilization rates return to pre-crisis levels. Although employment conditions
continue to improve, unemployment rates remain at high levels.
The Committee has noted that annual inflation rate would hover significantly
above the target for sometime before reverting back to a downward trend as the
temporary factors taper off starting in the last quarter of the year. Inflation rate would
converge to levels consistent with the targets by early 2011. Core inflation indicators
would increase in April as well, due to temporary tax cuts of the previous year, but
would continue to remain at levels below the target. The Committee has indicated that
elevated levels of inflation, albeit temporary, warrants close monitoring of price setting
behavior.
Observing these developments and the normalization in the money and credit
markets, the Committee has decided to gradually remove the liquidity measures
implemented during the crisis. However, despite recent improvements, lingering
problems across the global economy are not resolved completely. Accordingly, the
Committee has stated that it may be necessary to maintain policy rates at current levels
for some time, and to keep them at low levels for a long period.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation
outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within
eight working days.
