Press Release on Company Accounts
Statistics
16 September 2020, No: 2020-57

The data coverage of company accounts statistics has been expanded
to include administrative records in collaboration with the Turkish
Statistical Institute.
Since 1990, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) has published Company Accounts
Statistics collected from a sample of companies financed by bank loans. This year, the CBRT
collaborated with the Turkish Statistical Institute (TURKSTAT) on the expansion of the data
coverage for Company Accounts Statistics to include administrative records.
The new CBRT-TURKSTAT Company Accounts Statistics are compiled from financial tables of more
than one million manufacturing or non-manufacturing companies operating in 17 sectors and
cover a period of 11 years from 2009 to 2019.
These statistics include
• Financial tables aggregated by subsector and scale,
• Information on the number of firms, legal status, and number of employees,
• Structural indicators for assets, liabilities, own funds and profitability, credit use, and
ratios.
The CBRT-TURKSTAT Company Accounts Statistics can be accessed here.
