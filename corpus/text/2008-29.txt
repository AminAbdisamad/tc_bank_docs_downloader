THE CBRT PRESS RELEASE ON
THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE SELLING AUCTIONS
Recent problems in global credit markets have led to concerns on the
credibility of the global financial system. These developments have adversely
affected the global liquidity flows and triggered an extraordinary demand for liquidity
especially in USD.
Acting promptly and in a coordinated manner, central banks are taking
decisions in an effort to overcome the liquidity squeeze in money markets. In line with
these efforts, decisions and actions of the Central Bank of Turkey (CBRT) also aim to
maintain the smooth functioning of all domestic money markets.
Within this framework, starting from today the CBRT has decided to inject
foreign exchange liquidity into the market through foreign exchange selling
auctions under the basic principles of the floating exchange rate regime, as
unhealthy fluctuations have been witnessed recently in foreign exchange market due
to a decrease in the depth of the market.
The daily amount of foreign exchange to be sold via auctions has been set as
USD 50 million, which can be raised on the auction days when deemed necessary.
Guidelines for foreign exchange selling auctions is annexed herewith. Depending on
the developments in the foreign exchange market, the daily auction amounts may be
changed with prior notice, while the auctions may be suspended as well, when
deemed necessary.
In addition, the CBRT may intervene the market via directly selling foreign
exchange as it did before, in cases where, despite the foreign exchange selling
auction, supply falls excessively short of meeting the demand for foreign exchange,
and/or an excessive volatility in exchange rates due to speculative behaviour
originating from liquidity shortage is observed.
