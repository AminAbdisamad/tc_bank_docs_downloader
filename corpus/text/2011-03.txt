SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: January 20, 2011

Inflation Developments
1. In December, consumer prices decreased by 0.30 percent, and annual
inflation fell to 6.40 percent. Thus, the annual inflation rate was quite close to
the end-2010 target of 6.5 percent. Unprocessed food prices continued to fall,
while the inflation in services and core goods rose slightly, yet remained in line
with medium-term targets. Headline inflation would continue to decelerate in
coming months, mainly due to base effects, whereas the annual rate of
increase in core indicators is expected to increase, albeit modestly.
2. Unprocessed food prices continued to fall with a December outturn of 5.79
percent. Prices of fresh fruits and vegetables as well as red meat decreased.
As stated in the October Inflation Report, fruit and vegetable production
forecasts for 2010 suggested that fruit and vegetable prices were rising only
temporarily and would see a correction in the final quarter. Indeed, increases
in fruit and vegetable prices were followed by larger-than-expected decreases
during the fourth quarter, bringing the annual unprocessed food inflation down
from 31.28 percent in October to 8.52 percent at year-end.
3. Regarding processed food, processed meat prices declined while prices of
bread and cereals and solid and liquid fats increased on rising international
food prices. Thus, after soaring at an unprecedented rate amid higher
unprocessed food prices during the third quarter, the annual inflation in food
and nonalcoholic beverages slowed to 7.02 percent, bringing the group's
contribution to annual inflation down to 1.94 percentage points at year-end
from as high as 4.67 percentage points over 2010.
4. Energy prices rose by 2.73 percent in December amid higher fuel and bottled
gas prices driven by rising international oil prices and exchange rate
developments. Moreover, water tariffs went up in a number of cities.
Therefore, after slowing in the second half of 2010, the annual energy inflation
increased to 9.96 percent in December.
5. The services inflation rate registered an all-time year-end low of 4.24 percent.
Although services inflation rose slightly in December due to higher

communication prices, inflation was down in rents, hotels, restaurants and
transport services. The annual inflation in core goods (goods excluding food,
energy, alcoholic beverages, tobacco and gold) rose to 1.70 percent owing to
December's lower-than-average seasonal discounts on clothing and footwear.
Overall, the annual rate of increase in core inflation indicators was slightly
faster in December but remained in line with medium-term targets.

Factors Affecting Inflation
6. Recent releases have been consistent with the outlook presented in the
October Inflation Report. Despite falling month-on-month in November,
industrial production was significantly higher than the third-quarter average
during October-November owing to sharp increases in October. Leading
indicators suggest that November's production loss would be offset in
December. In fact, the fourth-quarter capacity utilization rates and
expectations for new orders point to a faster production growth than in the
third quarter. These developments confirm the Committee's expectation of a
renewed acceleration in economic activity for the final quarter of 2010.
7. Economic activity continues to recover amid strong domestic demand. The
production and imports of consumer goods were higher during OctoberNovember than the third-quarter average. The fourth-quarter improvement in
survey indicators, sales data and consumer confidence points to an ongoing
recovery in private consumption demand. Yet, the Committee expects the
recent policy measures to restrain the pace of recovery in loans and domestic
demand over the upcoming period.
8. The production and imports of investment goods, particularly those related to
motor vehicles, increased significantly during October-November compared to
the third-quarter average. Indicators for the last quarter suggest that private
investments would accelerate quarter-on-quarter and continue to rise sharply
year-on-year. The Committee expects the robust growth in investments to
continue into coming months amid supportive monetary conditions and
reduced demand uncertainty. Indeed, both the gradual rise in capacity
utilization rates and the manufacturing industry investments recently hitting a
four-year high support this observation. However, Committee members have
noted that foreign demand uncertainties would continue to slow the pace of
recovery in investments, particularly in the manufacturing industry.
9. Uncertainties remain about foreign demand. Although the export quantity
index excluding gold increased quarter-on-quarter during October-November
after declining in the third quarter, leading indicators for exports and new
orders show no sign of a strong recovery in the short term. In fact, exports

have grown at quite a weaker and more volatile pace than domestic demand
during the recovery. Having noted that industrial capacity utilization rates
remain below their pre-crisis levels due to weak foreign demand, the
Committee expects this slowdown to continue for a while in view of the
prospects of a weak global economic recovery.
10. Although employment conditions continue to improve, unemployment rates
remain at high levels. Non-farm employment increased during SeptemberNovember in seasonally adjusted terms. Leading indicators point to an
acceleration in December's non-farm employment growth, confirming the
Committee's expectation that the third-quarter pause was temporary and
employment growth would resume by the end of the year. Nevertheless, the
Committee has reiterated that unemployment rates would remain higher than
pre-crisis levels for some time, containing unit labor costs.
11. Against this backdrop, the Committee has stated that aggregate demand
conditions do not exert upside pressures on inflation.
Monetary Policy and Risks
12. According to the Committee members, the impact of the measures taken in
December to contain credit supply will be seen in the forthcoming days. It was
indicated that additional restrictive measures on credit expansion, to be taken
until the next meeting, would provide more room for monetary policy. In this
respect, the Committee stated that additional hikes in required reserve ratios
for short term liabilities would be necessary.
13. Since the launch of inflation targeting in 2006, the Committee has announced
its medium-term inflation forecasts and provided a qualitative perspective
regarding the outlook for policy rates. The current economic climate requires
the monetary policy to consider financial stability along with financial stability,
requiring the Committee to utilize a broader set of monetary policy instruments
including policy rates, reserve requirement ratios, and liquidity management
facilities. Therefore, the Committee has indicated that lower policy rate
coupled with higher reserve requirement ratios is the optimal policy mix under
current conditions, in terms of upholding both financial stability and price
stability. In this respect, it was decided that the policy rate would be reduced
by 25 basis points.
14. Given the mounting uncertainties concerning the global economic outlook,
flexibility regarding each instrument within the policy mix would be needed.
Therefore, the Committee agreed that the Inflation Report will provide
forecasts for the net effect of the policy mix rather than the direction of each
policy instrument, and will not outline an explicit path regarding the individual
elements of the policy mix.

15. The Committee evaluated the forecasts to be presented in the January
Inflation Report. Inflation is expected to decline significantly in January and
remain below the end-year target of 5.5 percent in the first quarter, before
displaying a volatile path starting with the second quarter. Assuming that a
limited monetary tightening brings credit growth rate down to 20-25 percent in
2011, the revised forecasts indicate that inflation would be close to the target
by the end of 2011. The Committee noted that the envisaged monetary
tightening in 2011 may be executed through various combinations of different
policy tools. It was underscored that the monetary tightening could be
implemented by either required reserve ratios or policy rates, or a combination
of both. Moreover, it was stated that during the tightening process, both
instruments could move in either the same or in opposite directions. On the
other hand, the Committee also emphasized that the net impact of the
measures taken—and to be taken in the future—within the new policy
framework, will be restrictive.
16. The baseline scenario of the January Inflation Report envisages a gradual
tightening by changing the mix of the policy rate and reserve requirement
ratios. Such a tightening should not only aim at slowing down credit growth
and domestic demand, but also reduce macroprudential concerns. The impact
of the monetary tightening on the credit growth is expected to be apparent
over the near term. However, the time lag and the extent of the impact of the
policy measures may vary depending on the developments beyond the control
of monetary policy. Therefore, the Committee will closely monitor the effects of
the policy measures and take further actions should the credit growth rate or
the inflation rate deviate from the desired levels.
17. Developments regarding the global economy remain central for the domestic
inflation and monetary policy outlook. Under current conditions, the Committee
is utilizing several instruments in order to preserve both price stability and
financial stability. Therefore, global developments would not only affect the
direction of the policy instruments, but also their mix. Accordingly, global
developments will be assessed against their effects on the aggregate demand
as well as its composition.
18. Although there has been some improvement regarding the expectations on the
US economy, uncertainties driven by debt sustainability problems across euro
area peripheral economies still persist. Ongoing problems in credit, real estate,
and labor markets across developed economies and the uncertainties
regarding the impact of fiscal consolidations continue to pose downside risks
regarding the pace of global growth. The possibility of a longer-thananticipated period of anemic global growth and a long period of quantitative
easing by developed economies not only creates downside risks regarding
external demand but also suggests that capital inflows may continue at a

faster pace. Should such a scenario materialize, a policy mix of low policy rate
and high reserve requirement ratios may be implemented for a long period,
both for balancing the domestic and external demand and for macroprudential
purposes. Moreover, an outcome whereby global economic problems intensify
and contribute to a contraction of domestic economic activity may require an
easing in all policy instruments.
19. Although downside risks are important, there are also upside risks regarding
global economy, particularly driven by the lagged impacts of the exceptionally
loose monetary policies implemented by the developed economies during the
past two years. If the global economy faces a faster-than-expected recovery,
global inflation may increase and thus trigger a tightening in the monetary
policies of developed economies. Materialization of such a scenario would
mean higher global interest rates and demand-driven domestic inflation, and
thus necessitate a tightening by using both policy rates and reserve
requirements.
20. Oil and other commodity prices have displayed rapid increases in the recent
period. The increases in commodity prices, if they persist, exert risks regarding
general pricing behavior, given the strong pace of domestic demand. Should
such a risk materialize and hamper the attainment of the medium-term inflation
targets, there may be stronger tightening than envisaged in the baseline
scenario. However, the policy mix may vary depending on the developments
regarding external demand, capital flows, and the outlook for credit growth.
21. The Committee continues to monitor fiscal policy developments closely while
formulating monetary policy. Increasing government saving under current
circumstances is essential to control the current account deficit driven by the
disparity between domestic and external demand. Our inflation forecasts take
the fiscal projections of the Medium Term Program (MTP) as given. A revision
in the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal stance
deviate significantly from this framework and consequently have an adverse
effect on inflation outlook.
22. Monetary policy will continue to focus on price stability in the period ahead. To
this end, the impact of the macroprudential measures taken by the Central
Bank and other institutions on the inflation outlook will be considered carefully.
Strengthening the commitment to fiscal discipline and the structural reform
agenda would support the improvement of Turkey’s sovereign risk, and thus
facilitate macroeconomic and price stability. Sustaining the fiscal discipline will
also provide more flexibility for monetary policy and support the social welfare
by keeping interest rates permanently at low levels. In this respect, timely
implementation of the structural reforms envisaged by the MTP and the
European Union accession process remains to be of utmost importance.
