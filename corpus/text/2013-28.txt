DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Meeting Date: June 18, 2013
Participating Committee Members
Erdem Başçı (Governor), Ahmet Faruk Aysan, Murat Çetinkaya, Turalay Kenç, Necati
Şahin, Abdullah Yavaş, Mehmet Yörükoğlu.

The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short
term interest rates constant at the following levels:
a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) at 4.5 percent,
b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing at 3.5 percent, lending rate at 6.5
percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via
repo transactions at 6 percent,
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.):
Borrowing rate at 0 percent, lending rate at 9.5 percent.
Recent data suggest that domestic and external demand are evolving in line with
expectations. Domestic demand follows a healthy recovery while exports slow down
due to weak global economic activity. The current policy framework and the decline in
commodity prices limit the impact of the increasing economic activity on the current
account deficit.
Recently, capital flows have weakened due to increasing uncertainty regarding
the global monetary policies. Yet, loan growth continues to hover above the reference
rate.
In this regard, the impact of exchange rate movements as well as growth in loans
and domestic demand on the pricing behavior will be closely monitored.
Ongoing uncertainties regarding the global economy and the volatility in capital
flows necessitate the monetary policy to remain flexible in both directions. To this end,
necessary adjustments will be made in the composition of Turkish lira liquidity provided
by the Central Bank.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the
Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within
five working days.
