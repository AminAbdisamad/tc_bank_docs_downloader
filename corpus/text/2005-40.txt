 1October Inflation and Outlook 
 
I. GENERAL EVALUATION 
 
1. According to the indices with base year 2003, the C PI increased by 1.79 percent 
and the PPI by 0.68 in October 2005. Annual inflati on in the CPI and PPI became 
7.52 percent and 2.57 percent, respectively (Graph 1).  
2. In October, the special CPI aggregate F, which excl udes energy, alcoholic 
beverages, tobacco products, other goods with admin istered prices, and indirect 
taxes, increased by 2.23 percent in monthly terms, while the G index, obtained by 
excluding unprocessed food from the F index, displa yed a 1.75 percent-increase 
(Table 1). The year-on-year increase in October for  these indices became 6.41 
percent and 6.70 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, the index obtained by excluding 
seasonal products from the CPI excluding energy, al coholic beverages and tobacco 
index, increased by 6.85 percent in year-on-year te rms (Graph 1).       
3. In October, agricultural prices increased by 1.86 p ercent, whereas the PPI 
excluding agriculture (industrial prices) rose by 0 .38 percent (Table 1).

Developments in Consumer Prices 
4. The main determinants of the CPI increase in Octobe r are (i) seasonal 
developments in the prices of food, (ii) high incre ase in the clothing and footwear 
group due to seasonality, (iii) price increase in t he housing group and (iv) the rise in 
prices of household goods.  
5. The monthly price increase in the food and non-alco holic beverages group is 2.25 
percent. The effect of Ramadan in October and other  seasonal increases in prices 
account for the increase in this group.  
6. In October, prices in the clothing and footwear gro up increased by 7.25 percent 
due to the effect of the new season products, while  prices in this group displayed a 
2.97 percent decrease in the first ten months of th e year. It is anticipated that the 
rate of increase will still be high in November, th ough lower than that of October. 
However, for 2005 in general, increases in prices o f the clothing and footwear group 
are expected to remain below the end-year inflation  target.   37. The monthly price increase in the housing group is 1.47 percent. The main 
determinants of housing prices in October were the increase in fuel oil prices 
triggered by price increases in petroleum products,  as well as the increase in rents.   
 
 
8. In October, prices of household goods rose by 1.87 percent mainly due to 
increases in prices of white goods and furniture. P rices in the entertainment and 
culture group displayed a further decrease of 0.60 percent in October, following the 
decline observed in September. The main determinant  of this decline is the 
substantial fall in the prices of package tours ite m, which builds up a significant part 
of the group, due to seasonal effects.  
 
Developments in Producer Prices 
9.  Along with the 0.68 percent increase in producer p rices in October, the 
cumulative increase in the PPI was realized as 3.69  percent during the first ten 
months of the year.  
10. Agricultural prices, which started to climb seasona lly in September, increased 
by 1.86 percent in October. Price increases in the agriculture sector are expected to 
continue during the rest of the year. Meanwhile, th e agricultural prices, which Graph 2: CPI and Special CPI Aggregates (F and G) ( Annual Percentage Change)

the PPI. 
11. Manufacturing industry prices increased by 0.38 per cent in October. The 
increase in prices of petroleum products remained a t 0.35 percent in October as the 
price increases that were observed at the end of Se ptember reversed their course in 
October. Meanwhile, price increase in sectors sensi tive to oil prices, namely chemical 
goods and plastic and rubber production continue, a lbeit at a lower pace. In October 
2005, the price increases in clothing and textile p roductions, which were realized at 
lower rates compared to previous years, partially l imited the rise in the 
manufacturing industry index. Moreover, one of the factors that limited the price 
increase in the manufacturing industry was the pric e of food production, which 
dropped due to the sharp decline in the poultry sec tor.

  5II. OUTLOOK 
 
Inflation Developments 
12. In the Inflation and Outlook Report issued last mon th, we drew attention to 
the fact that the impression as to disinflation com ing to a halt had stemmed mostly 
from the rise in oil prices. In fact, along with th e weakening of this negative impact 
caused by the oil prices, inflation was seen to fal l below the target in October.  
13. In October, the primary effects of oil price increa ses on annual inflation are 
estimated to be around 1.5 percentage points. The d ata pertaining to price 
developments and expectations confirm that the effe cts of oil price increases on 
inflation have mostly been of primary nature. In ot her words, oil price increases only 
affected the sectors where petroleum products are u sed directly as input, and 
inflation expectations maintained their favorable c ourse. However, as a result of the 
relative revival in the economy and structural fact ors, rapid price increases continue 
in the services items such as rents and restaurant- hotels groups. Furthermore, high 
price increases stemming from oil prices that are o bserved in some of the sub-groups 
of transportation and housing group, continue to po se a risk to the target set for 
2006.  Meanwhile, inflation in the goods group excl uding energy being in tune with 
the 2006 target is considered as a favorable factor . 
14. Developments in the producer price index provide po sitive signals pertaining 
to inflation in the upcoming period. Industrial pro duction prices excluding items 
directly affected by the petroleum products are at historically low levels. However, it 
should be kept in mind that producer prices may be changing rapidly depending on 
the cost factors, which limit their informative val ue pertaining to the future tendency 
of inflation. Analysis of the special CPI aggregate s rather than that of the producer 
prices is a better approach for a healthier evaluat ion of inflation in the upcoming 
period.   
15. Following the decline in September, a general slowd own in the annual rates of 
increase the special CPI aggregates is observed in October. This is considered to be 
a positive development pertaining to the inflation in the upcoming period. It is 
especially noteworthy that despite the substantial increase in the prices of seasonal  6products in October, the annual rates of price incr eases of all the special CPI 
aggregates involving these products maintained thei r downward trend. 
16. Irregularities in the seasonal movements covered by  the special CPI 
aggregates make it more difficult for the developme nts in these aggregates to be 
interpreted. Besides, as the number of observations  is not sufficient, the series 
cannot be seasonally adjusted in statistical terms.  To overcome this hurdle to a 
certain extent, i.e. to seasonally adjust the speci al CPI aggregates, multiple series 
are being produced within the Central Bank by exclu ding the seasonal products 
(several food and clothing products having variable  weights within the index) from 
selected special CPI aggregates. The slowdown in th e annual growth rates of these 
series is a significant indicator for inflation in the upcoming period. For example, the 
annual rate of increase of the index formed by excl uding seasonal products from 
special aggregate (E), which excludes energy, alcoh olic beverages and tobacco 
products maintained its gradual decline within the past year, falling below 7 percent 
(Graph 1).  
17. Consequently, not only the analysis of the sub-item s of inflation, but also the 
special CPI aggregates point to the forecast that i nflation adjusted for temporary 
factors is below the 2005 target, but above that of  2006, while signaling that the 
main trend is likely to be downward. In this case, the analysis of supply and demand 
developments has crucial significance for the evalu ation of the attainability of the 
2006 inflation target.  
Factors Affecting Inflation 
18. The data obtained during the last month do not indi cate a substantial change 
in the supply and demand conditions compared to the  previous month. Foreign 
demand remains relatively stable despite some slowd own in recent years. Domestic 
demand is increasing in a controlled manner, and th e improving investment climate 
is continuing. 
19. Seasonally adjusted data regarding private consumer  spending show that the 
demand for durable consumption goods is in an upwar d trend in the third quarter. In 
addition, the results of the business tendency surv ey and consumer tendency survey  7give clear signals that consumer spending has conti nued to rise in the last period. 
However, the said upward trend seems to be more con trolled compared to that of 
the first half of 2005 and it is not expected that there would be any obvious pressure 
on inflation in the short-term. There is no doubt t hat the current supply-demand 
conditions are very different than those of the per iod 2001-2003. Although today’s 
demand conditions do not exert any pressure on infl ation, the positive contribution of 
demand factors to the downward trend in inflation i s seen to have weakened. In this 
regard, sustaining high productivity increases has become critical in order to achieve 
stable economic growth along with the decline in in flation in the next period. The 
continuation of productivity increases, in turn, wi ll depend on the determination to 
pursue structural reforms that would support produc tion and investments. 
20. The recent recovery in the investment climate is im portant for boosting the 
output potential of the economy. The machinery-equi pment manufacturing that had 
declined on a yearly basis starting from March, res umed growth in August due to the 
removal of the base effect. It is expected that thi s trend in machinery-equipment 
manufacturing should continue in the rest of the ye ar as well. Besides, the rise of 
23,1 percent and 23,5 percent in electrical machine ry manufacturing and in imports 
of capital goods, respectively, in the period of Ju ly-August 2005 compared to the 
same period of 2004 shows that the demand for machi nery-equipment investment 
continues. Moreover, in the third quarter of 2005, domestic sales of commercial 
vehicles, which have increased considerably compare d to the same period of 2004, 
seem to support the strong investment tendency. Als o, the seasonally adjusted data 
regarding imports of capital goods and domestic sal es of commercial vehicles 
indicate an increase in the third quarter compared to the previous period. 
Furthermore, the reversal of decline that was obser ved in the investment climate 
according to the business tendency survey is a posi tive development for investor 
confidence. 
21. The continuation of a favorable investment climate is especially important for 
not putting pressure on the output capacity when th e economy grows rapidly and for 
ensuring productivity increases. Increased producti vity limits the unit labor costs and 
restrains the inflationary pressures that may be cr eated due to the revival in 
economic activity.  822. Obviously, net foreign demand and domestic value ad ded factors must be 
considered to evaluate the aggregate supply and dem and equilibrium. According to 
recently announced forecasts, the world economy wil l continue to grow in the 
coming year, although there will be somewhat of a s lowdown.   However, it is very 
unlikely that the foreign demand arising from this growth could create an additional 
inflationary pressure. The reason is that the persi stent and rapid increase in exports 
and imports and increased competition would restrai n potential pressures to be 
created by foreign demand on inflation.  
23. Credit developments are another factor that is clos ely monitored with regard 
to the inflation outlook. Recently, credit utilizat ion growth by individuals and 
companies seems to have stabilized. Housing credits  are still in high demand. Clearly, 
the fact that long-term interest rates have decline d considerably in 2005 could 
support the credit expansion and domestic demand in  the next period. In the 
normalization process of the economy, the continuat ion of credit expansion resulting 
from the decrease of fiscal dominance and the incre ase of financial deepening should 
not come as a surprise. Moreover, world examples sh ow that there is still much to be 
done regarding the total credit volume. In this tra nsition period, the Central Bank 
sees the rapid credit expansion as a development to  be followed carefully in terms of 
risks that might arise for price stability and fina ncial stability.  
24. To summarize, it can be said that although the curr ent supply-demand 
conditions do not put pressure on inflation, the ex istence of these factors do not 
completely remove concerns over the secondary effec ts of oil price increases. 
However, considering the productivity increases, th e level of capacity utilization ratio 
and the current situation of the labor market, it i s highly likely that the main trend of 
inflation will be downward if no major shock occurs  in the coming period. 
Monetary Policy and Risks 
25. Monetary policy concerns the future inflation inste ad of the present one. The 
congruence of inflation forecasts with the medium-t erm targets is the fundamental 
consideration of monetary policy decisions. As unde rlined in previous reports, the 
“medium-term” spans the upcoming one and a half yea r starting from today. This  9time span represents the control horizon that indic ates how far ahead monetary 
policy is capable of affecting inflation. To this e nd, the Central Bank has shifted its 
focus on to the 2006 year-end inflation target sinc e the second half of 2005. It is 
clear that along with the structural transformation  in the economy the phases of the 
monetary transmission mechanism have prolonged, als o changing the definition of 
the control horizon. In a stable economic environme nt, the prolongation of the 
monetary transmission mechanism and the extension o f the control horizon would 
not be surprising. Indeed, in developed countries w here inflation targeting is 
implemented, the effects of monetary policy on infl ation are extended for a period 
longer than two years. 
26. In the next period, the major risk factors that mig ht endanger the 
achievement of the inflation target are generally l inked to international 
developments. The first of these risks is the proba bility of persistence of high 
increases in oil prices. Estimations of oil prices are subject to frequent change; 
therefore, they do not display a clear vision. Cons equently, the probability of the 
continuation of high oil prices is evaluated by the  Central Bank as one of the major 
risk factors. Undoubtedly, as long as inflation exp ectations do not deteriorate, price 
increases stemming from oil prices will not have a sizably large effect on monetary 
policy. However, inflation expectations must be man aged with the utmost care in an 
economy, which has suffered from persistent high in flation. In an environment where 
price stability has not yet been established, monet ary policy must continue to pursue 
a cautious stance. In this context, the probability  of the emergence of secondary 
effects due to oil price increases and the deterior ation of inflation expectations 
should not be disregarded. As a result, oil prices have become a factor that requires 
extra caution from the monetary policy standpoint.  
27. The second major risk for future inflation is the l ikely fluctuation of 
international liquidity conditions. The historicall y low interest rates in developed 
countries in recent years have caused global funds to flow into emerging market 
economies like Turkey that have taken major steps t owards stability. In the event of 
a reversal of this trend, there might be fluctuatio ns in financial markets. In such 
volatile conditions monetary policy should adopt a more cautious attitude. On the 
other hand, it should also be kept in mind that suc h similar developments have been  10 experienced many times during the last four years a nd their negative effects 
remained temporary due to economic stability and th e atmosphere of confidence 
established by determined policies. In the event of  the resumption of such a 
situation, the continuation of steps such as tax an d social security reform that are 
intended to increase the budget flexibility bears v ital importance, if the volatility in 
the economy is to remain at minimum in the next per iod as well. It must be 
remembered that, favorable expectations should be p reserved in order to put an end 
to the price instability that has caused serious da mage to the economy for more than 
three decades. 
28. The third risk for the achievement of the 2006 infl ation target is the continued 
rigidity in services price inflation. In the next p eriod, increases in service prices that 
are not sensitive to oil prices are expected to gra dually slow down. However, 
considering the high productivity rates in tradable  goods and due to the structural 
transformation process the economy is undergoing it  will not be surprising if services 
price inflation continue to stay well above goods p rices. At present, the share of the 
services group within the CPI is small. However, in  time the share of the services 
group is expected to grow as a result of increases in relative prices of the services 
group and changes of consumer preferences. Therefor e, the total contribution of 
price increases in the services group to the 2006 i nflation is estimated to be more 
than half of the target. To attain such an inflatio n target under these conditions, 
price increases in the goods group should remain be tween 3 and 3.5 percent next 
year. This is possible only if oil price increases slowdown and their secondary effects 
remain limited, as well as the current trend in glo bal liquidity persists and the 
domestic demand is kept under control. 
Conclusion 
29. In the light of the above evaluations that also tak e into account the views put 
forward at the Monetary Policy Committee meeting, d ated 8 November 2005, it has 
been decided to cut short-term interest rates appli ed at the CBRT Interbank Money 
Market and Istanbul Stock Exchange Repo-Reverse Rep o Market by 0.25 percentage 
points. In case there is no extraordinary developme nt in the last two months of the 
year, 2005 inflation is expected to achieve the yea r-end target. Although there could  11 be some fluctuations in the following months, it is  predicted that the main course of 
inflation, excluding temporary factors, will be dow nward. However, the consistency 
of future inflation with the medium-term targets wi ll be conditional upon the 
favorable course of the above-stated risk factors, even if the monetary and fiscal 
policies are strictly implemented. In the light of the currently available information, 
the short-term interest rates are more likely to mo ve downward, rather than upward, 
in the next period, however the likelihood of them remaining stable is gradually 
increasing compared to previous periods. It is not possible to make a clear-cut 
statement about the future direction of this trend due to several factors: the main 
trend of inflation is proceeding above the medium-t erm targets, the positive 
contribution of favorable demand conditions to the downward trend in inflation has 
become less significant compared to the last three years, the rigidity of services price 
inflation persists, the uncertainties around liquid ity conditions still exist and there are 
concerns over the secondary effects of oil prices. In this context, it should be 
underlined that any new data and information associ ated with the inflation outlook in 
the next period will make the Central Bank to revis e its stance about the future.
