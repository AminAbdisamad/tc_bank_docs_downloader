transactions are left unchanged.  
The monthly maximum contractual and overdue interes t rates to be applied to

the Amendment to the Communiqué No. 2006/1 on Maxim um Interest Rates To Be 
Applied To Credit Card Transactions published in th e Official Gazette No: 28765 
dated 14 September 2013 and which took effect as of  1 October 2013, will continue 
to be valid for the 3-month period starting on 1 Ju ly 2014. 
Accordingly, the monthly maximum contractual intere st rate to be applied to 
credit card transactions from 1 July 2014 to 30 Sep tember 2014 is 2.02 percent for 
the Turkish lira, 1.70 percent for the US dollar an d 1.64 percent for the Euro, 
whereas the monthly maximum overdue interest rate i s 2.52 percent for the Turkish

As of 1 July 2014, the contractual and overdue inte rest rates to be applied by 
banks to credit card transactions will not exceed t he above-mentioned maximum 
rates. Banks are free to determine their respective  rates at their own discretion 
provided that they are below the ceiling rates. The  maximum contractual and overdue 
interest rates, which will be valid for the 3-month  period starting on 1 October 2014, 
will be announced by the CBRT prior to this date.  
Banks in Turkey, as is the case with the banks in o ther countries, set the credit 
card interest rates higher than those on consumer l oans. Therefore, the CBRT 
advises credit card holders to prefer consumer loan s rather than personal credit 
cards to meet their short-term credit needs.
