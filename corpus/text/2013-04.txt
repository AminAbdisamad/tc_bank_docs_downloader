SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 22 January 2013

Inflation Developments
1. In December, consumer prices were up by 0.38 percent and annual inflation went
down to 6.16 percent. Thus, the year-end CPI inflation hit the lowest level of the
last 44 years. Unprocessed food prices continued to support the decline in annual
consumer inflation. Core inflation indicators remained mild amid cost and
demand-side developments.
2. On the food and non-alcoholic beverages front, year-end annual inflation was
3.90 percent, which was significantly lower than past year averages. This was
mainly driven by unprocessed food prices, the annual inflation of which went
down to -2.78 percent upon falling vegetable prices. Leading indicators point that
the favorable trend in unprocessed food prices will reverse in January and the
group’s annual inflation will register notable increases. As for the processed food
group, parallel to the uptrend in domestic wheat prices, bread and cereals group
maintains rising prices; whereas annual inflation in items excluding breads and
cereals continues to decelerate.
3. Annual services inflation remained at 7 percent. Across subcategories,
communication services and rents registered rising inflation rates. However,
recording the lowest last-quarter-rise of recent years, restaurants-hotels and
transport services exhibited a decline in annual inflation. Both the seasonallyadjusted underlying trend and the diffusion index of the prices of services edged
down and pointed that prices of services remained on a mild track.
4. Annual inflation in core goods group followed a flat course compared to the
previous month and completed the year with 4.5 percent. The main driver of the
deceleration in core goods inflation across the year was durable goods prices,
which went up merely by 0.17 percent in 2012. In the forthcoming period, core
goods inflation is expected to maintain its decelerating trend due to the prices of
clothing and other core goods, which are core goods excluding durables.
Seasonally adjusted data show that the relatively mild pace in the underlying
trend of core inflation indicators continued despite the rise in December.
5. Overall, the Committee has indicated that inflation may increase slightly in
January due to adjustments in tobacco prices, but will resume its downward trend
afterwards. Core inflation indicators are expected to continue their downward
trend.

Factors Affecting Inflation
6. Data regarding the fourth quarter of 2012 indicated that economic activity is in a trend
of recovery. Increase in industrial production partially compensated for the decline
in October and production remained above the third-quarter level in the OctoberNovember period. The Committee highlighted that annual growth rates continue
to display notable fluctuations. In fact, industrial production, which recorded twodigit increases in November on an annual basis, is expected to exhibit a rather
minor change in December on an annual basis. Meanwhile, leading indicators
point that production will increasingly get stronger in the forthcoming period.
7. Data on production, imports and surveys regarding investment demand, which
have been one of the main drivers of the weak course of the final domestic
demand recently, signal for a recovery. Data related to consumption demand
indicate a mild increase in the private consumption demand. Due to the support of
lagged effects of the accommodative monetary policy, the recovery in the final
domestic demand is expected to continue in the first quarter. Recent acceleration in
loan growth and domestic market orders also support this outlook.
8. Recently released data suggest that despite the weakening global growth, exports
continue to increase on the back of market and product diversification. Imports, on
the other hand, are expected to slightly accelerate in the forthcoming months due to
the rise in domestic demand. However, the Committee estimates that the
improvement in the 12-month cumulative current account deficit will continue, albeit
at a slower pace.
9. Seasonally adjusted unemployment rate declined upon the rise in non-farm
employment in October 2012. Rise in the non-farm employment has mostly been
driven by the services sector, while employment in the industrial sector has remained
weak recently. Furthermore, the employment expectation data in the Business
Tendency Survey and the PMI employment data signal for improvements in
employment conditions in the last quarter of 2012. Other leading indicators also
signal that mild increases in non-farm employment will continue. However,
uncertainties regarding the global economy remain to be critical factors that may
restrain employment growth.

Risks and Monetary Policy
10. In the meeting, the Committee has assessed macroeconomic developments and
forecasts to appear in the January Inflation Report. It was concluded that there is
no major revision in the factors affecting inflation outlook, and thus year-end
inflation forecast would be kept at 5.3 percent. It was stated that core inflation
indicators are expected to continue their downward trend, yet the impact of
increases in administered prices on the pricing behavior will be monitored closely.

11. Recent data confirm that the rebalancing between the domestic and external
demand continues as envisaged. Domestic demand follows a moderate pace
while exports continue to increase despite weak global activity. Overall, current
account deficit continues to decline gradually.
12. The Committee has indicated that the recent credit growth has been faster than
envisaged. Developments regarding financial conditions such as rapid capital
inflows, improving credit supply conditions, and accommodative monetary policy
point to the risk of further acceleration in credit and domestic demand for the
forthcoming period, necessitating a cautious stance against macro financial risks.
The Committee stated that, in order to contain the risks on financial stability, the
proper policy would be to keep interest rates at low levels while continuing with
macroprudential measures. Accordingly, it was deemed appropriate to implement
a measured tightening through reserve requirements, while delivering a limited
downward shift in the interest rate corridor.
13. The Committee indicated that, although global risk perceptions have improved
considerably in the recent period, persisting volatility in the cross border capital
flows necessitate monetary policy to be flexible on both sides. Ongoing monetary
expansion in advanced economies, commitment to maintain this policy until
economic indicators improve, and increasing global risk appetite have been the
major factors leading to an acceleration in capital flows to emerging markets.
Nevertheless, the deleveraging process in advanced economies may impede the
recovery in the economic activity and thus slow down the improvement in the
budget balances. In fact, despite the steps taken to resolve the problems in the
euro area, outlook for credit markets and economic growth remain weak.
Meanwhile, uncertainty indices regarding the economic policy in major advanced
economies are still at high levels. Therefore, it is likely that the recent
improvement in the risk sentiment may reverse course in the forthcoming period.
Should such a risk materialize, the Central Bank will take the necessary measures
via the flexible policy framework it has developed.
14. Overall, ongoing uncertainties regarding the global economy necessitate the
monetary policy to remain flexible in both directions. Therefore, the impact of the
measures undertaken on credit, domestic demand, and inflation expectations will
be monitored closely and the funding amount will be adjusted in either direction,
as needed.
15. Accelerating capital inflows and weak global economic outlook may aggravate
macro financial risks, should they persist for a while. The recent policies pursued
by the Central Bank aim to prevent the build-up of risks arising from long lasting
capital inflows. In this respect, recent policies aim at containing rapid credit growth

and appreciation pressures on domestic currency. Macroprudential measures will
continue to be taken, should the recent global trends persist and credit growth
expectations exceed 15 percent for a long period.
16. On the other hand, aggregate demand and commodity prices may increase faster
than expected and monetary policy may normalize in advanced economies,
should the measures taken towards the solution of problems regarding the global
economy be completed sooner and more decisively than envisaged.
Materialization of such a risk would increase pressures on inflation, and thus
require a tightening using all policy instruments.
17. Unprocessed food prices continue to pose risks regarding inflation outlook.
Developments in unprocessed food prices were the main factors explaining the
lower-than-expected inflation in 2012. The possibility of this trend reversing in
2013 poses an upside risk on inflation. The Committee will not respond to volatility
in unprocessed food prices, yet will deliver the necessary tightening should this
lead to deterioration in pricing behavior.
18. The Committee monitors fiscal policy developments and tax adjustments closely,
with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. Inflation forecasts take the
framework outlined in the Medium Term Program as given. In this respect, it is
assumed that fiscal discipline will be sustained and there will be no unanticipated
hikes in administered prices. A revision in the monetary policy stance may be
considered, should the fiscal stance deviate significantly from this framework and
consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
19. Prudent fiscal and financial sector policies are crucial for preserving the resilience
of our economy against existing global imbalances. Strengthening the structural
reform agenda that would ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and
reduce the savings deficit would support macroeconomic stability in the mediumterm. This will also provide more flexibility for monetary policy and improve social
welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities persistently
at low levels. In this respect, steps towards implementation of the structural
reforms envisaged by the Medium Term Program remain to be of utmost
importance.
