The Central Bank of Turkey (CBT ) has been implementing an inflation 
targeting regime since the beginning of 2006. Central Bank Law, as stipulated in the 
Article 42, requires the CBT to be account able for the non-fulfillm ent of inflation 
targets. Inflation target for end-year 2008 was jointly set with the Government as 4 
percent. To facilitate the accountability principle, our  policy statement titled 
“Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy in 2008” disclosed a quarterly path consistent 
with the end-year 2008 targets along with an uncertainty band. In this context, any 
breach of upper or lower lim its of the band requires the CBT to write an open letter 
to the Government, explaining the reasons for the breach and the measures to be 
taken to ensure that inflation rate will retu rn to levels within pre-established limits. 
Inflation outturn as of June 2008 was 10.61 percent, breaching the upper limit 
of the uncertainty band, which was set at  8.5 percent for the end of the second 
quarter (Figure 1). Accordingly, this open le tter explains the reasons for this breach 
and presents the strategy adopted by the CBT to bring inflation back to the medium 
term targets.

Reasons For Breaching the Target The open letter dated April 2008 had pres ented a detailed explanation for 
breaching the target in the first quarter of the year. The source of inflation has not 
changed in the past quarter. Prolonged in creases in food, energy and other 
commodity prices have continued to exert significant upward pressures on headline 
inflation. As a consequence 6.8 percent age points of the 10.61 percent annual CPI 
inflation in June resulted from the direct impact of the rise  in food and energy prices 
(Figure 2).

Elevated food inflation was the main fa ctor impeding the disinflation process. 
Although domestic weather conditions turned more  favorable in the first half of 2008, 
lagged effects of last year’s poor harvest  and continued elevation in agricultural 
commodity prices continued to keep proc essed food inflation at high levels. 01 As a 
consequence, processed food in flation displayed a cumulative increase of 14.2 
percent in the first half of the year. 
Developments in energy prices have been the other major factor driving 
inflation in the second quarter.  Soaring oil prices continued to lead to significant 
hikes in the prices of domestic fuel products, also putting pressure on housing 
utilities such as electricity and natural gas.  
Services inflation displayed a limited ri se in the first half of 2008. Food and 
energy prices continued to exert upward pressures on the prices of catering and

prices.                                                                                        Central Bank of Turkey

The rise in core inflation in t he second quarter should be viewed as a 
temporary movement arising from the ex change rate pass-through, rather than 
deterioration in the general pr ice setting behavior. Ongoing difficulties in global credit 
markets coupled with domestic uncertainties have led to a depreciation of Turkish 
Lira vis-à-vis  major currencies in the first four months of the year. As a 
consequence, first round effects of ex change rate pass-through have been 
significant on the headline inflation as well as on core inflation figures during the 
March-May period. Yet, the recent r ebound in Turkish lira and weakening domestic 
demand has limited the overall pass-th rough and consequently core inflation 
showed signs of easing in June. Currently, annual rate of increase in CPI excluding 
food, energy, tobacco and gold items stands at 6.4 percent, confirming that the 
breach of the inflation targets can be mostly  attributed to factor s beyond the control 
of the monetary policy (Figure 4).

Elevated commodity prices have continued to exert inflationary pressures all 
over the world. As depicted in Figure 5,  almost all emerging economies under 
inflation targeting have faced significant  breaches in their inflation targets.

Reaction of Monetary Policy In the open letter dated April 2008, we indica ted that uncertainti es in the global 
economy, hikes in energy prices, and the risks to price setting behavior compelled 
the monetary policy to be more responsive to the incoming information. The letter 
revealed a clear tightening bias against in creased risks related to the second round 
effects of the supply side shocks. Food and energy prices continued to rise in the 
second quarter of 2008 and financial mark ets remained under stress. In the 
meantime domestic uncertainties have intens ified, having further adverse impact on 
the medium term inflation expectations. A ccordingly, there has been a significant 
upward surge in the medium term inflation expectations in the second quarter of 
2008 (Figure 6).

In order to contain the deterioration in inflation expectations and to prevent the 
materialization of the second round e ffects of supply-side shocks, the MPC 
tightened monetary policy in the past three m onths, increasing the policy rates by a 
cumulative of 150 basis points (Table 1). The monetary tightening was effective in 
controlling expectations. Consequently, the det erioration in inflation expectations 
came to a halt in July (Figure 6).

Inflation Outlook Recent developments in supply and dem and conditions have been in line with 
our assessments presented in the previous letter. Although first quarter private 
consumption growth at 7.3 percent appears quite strong in annual terms, the 
seasonally adjusted figures point to an ongoing moderation in economic activity 
(Figure 7). Also, recent readings on dom estic sales, production and confidence 
indicators suggest a similar outlook.
1F1F2 
    
Data on consumer credits suggest that  monetary conditions continue to be 
restrictive. Consumer loans have been gro wing at a moderate pace compared to the 
periods of vigorous domestic demand (Fi gure 8). The cautious monetary policy 
stance, increased precautionary saving, and t he tightening in global credit conditions 
are likely to restrain credit expansion in the period ahead.

Overall, domestic demand conditions cont inue to support disinflation (Figure 
9). Therefore, the underlying inflation is ex pected to decelerate in the medium term. 
         After the significant weakening of the Turk ish lira in the first four months of 
2008 (Figure 10), exchange rates have revers ed direction in the past two months, 
easing to some extent potential pressure s on tradable inflation resulting from the 
exchange rate pass-through. In the April lette r, the first round impact of the recent 
depreciation was estimated to be close to  2-percentage points for the end-2008 
headline inflation. The recent rebound in curr ency has led to a downward revision in 
the estimated pass-through. We now anticipate a cumulative exchange pass-
through of around 1.2 percent points for 2008, most of which has already been 
materialized between March-May period.

Longer-term interest rates have also in creased in the second quarter due to 
rising risk premium and inflation expectations  (Figure 11). Although higher interest 
rates contain the domestic demand and suppor t disinflation, the impact of the 
heightened risk premium on the overall pricing behavior should be closely 
monitored. 
        Baseline assumptions in the April Infl ation Report envisaged a constant path 
for oil prices around 105 USD per barrel over  the forecast horizon. However, oil 
prices continued to rise on the back of increasing international commodity prices, 
necessitating an upward revision. Taking the av erage future prices in the first three 
weeks of July as a benchmark, our baseli ne scenario for oil prices has been revised 
to USD 140 per barrel.
2F2F3 This revision has increased the end-2008 inflation forecast 
by 1.8 percentage points, and also added to the end-2009 forecasts 0.6 percentage 
points. 
Our revised forecasts envisage slight ly higher food inflation in 2008 and 2009 
compared to the April Infl ation Report. Although unprocessed food prices followed a 
relatively favorable course, processed food infl ation is likely to stay at high levels for 
while, given the elevated cour se of agricultural commodity prices. Against this 
backdrop, we have raised the assumptions fo r food inflation from 13 percent to 14 
percent for the year 2008, and from 8 percent  to 9 percent for the year 2009. These 
changes have led to an upward revision in our  inflation forecasts by about 30 basis 
points, both for 2008 and 2009. The projections envisage gradually moderating food 
inflation throughout the foreca st horizon. In this context, assumption for 2010 food 
inflation is 7 percent. 
 
                                                 
3 We also assume that the adjustment of electricity tariffs in the context of automatic pricing mechanism will be 
compatible with the oil price scenario. Figure 11: Benchmark Interest Rate and Policy Rate

 9Accordingly, we now forecast inflati on to be around 10.6 percent at the end of 
2008. Under the assumption of a limited ti ghtening towards the end of 2008, our 
medium term forecasts suggest that, with 70 percent probability, inflation will be 
between 5,9 and 9.3 percent (mid-point 7,6) at the end of 2009, and between 4 
percent and 7.8 per cent  (mid-point 5.9) at the end of 2010  (Figure 12). Our inflation 
forecast for mid-2011 is 5.4 percent. We expect non-food inflation to be lower than 
these figures.

  Source: CBT 
* The shaded region indicates the 70 percen t confidence interval for the forecast.  
To sum up, although economic activity in  the past quarter have evolved in line 
with our expectations, the significant increas es in oil and processed food prices have 
led to an upward revision in our forecasts. The main message of the forecast is that 
preventing the materialization of pot ential second round effects and ensuring a 
steady decline in inflation towards the medi um term targets, requires the monetary 
policy to maintain a cautious stance for a while. 
It should be emphasized that any new data or information regarding the 
inflation outlook may lead to a change in our  policy stance. Therefore, the path for 
the policy rates indicated above should not be perceived as a commitment on behalf 
of the CBT.

 10Our baseline scenario is based on quite c onservative assumptions for food and 
energy prices, implying that downside risks on these factors are as significant as 
upside risks. 3F3F4 Should the upside risks materializ e, monetary policy will be conducted 
so as to minimize upside deviations from the targets. Downward surprises in food 
and energy prices, on the ot her hand, will be perceived as an opportunity to bring 
inflation back to target in a shorter period than envisaged in our baseline scenario. 
Despite the expected decline in inflation in  the medium term, uncertainties exist 
regarding the degree of inflat ion persistence. Long-lasting supply shocks have been 
keeping headline inflation at elevated levels  and thus increasing the risk of rising 
backward looking schemes in the wage and price setting behavior. Although the 
widening output gap should contain the sec ond round effects of the supply shocks, 
the exact pace of disinflation would still depend on the extent new inflation targets 
serve as a strong reference for economic agents. Having this in mind, the CBT will 
continue to focus on enhancing the credibility of  the new inflation targets. In this 
context, developments in the general pric ing behavior and the underlying inflation 
trends will be monitored closely. 
International financial markets remain fr agile and the credit conditions continue 
to tighten up. The eventual impact of t he financial turmoil on the global economic 
activity is yet to be seen. Moreover, risi ng commodity prices continue to be a threat 
for price stability. These uncertainti es have been dampening the risk appetite and 
thus slowing down the capital flows to emerging markets, leaving these economies 
susceptible to shifts in the market sentiment. Domestic uncertainties have 
exacerbated these effects, as manifested by  the significant rise in the sovereign 
credit risk of Turkey in the first half of the year, compared to the average risk 
premium of emerging economie s. The CBT will not display a sharp reaction to 
temporary fluctuations in the financial markets, unless there is a long lasting 
deterioration in expectations and/or a signi ficant worsening in the general pricing 
behavior. 
Finally, our medium-term projections assume that government expenditures 
will evolve in line with the official pr ojections and that t here will be no further 
increases in indirect taxes or administer ed price adjustments, except those required 
by the automatic pricing me chanisms. Any deviation from this framework may lead 
to a revision of the outlook for inflation and monetary policy.  
 
Conclusion A protracted period of rising food and ener gy prices has been hampering our 
disinflation efforts since the adoption of the inflation targeting regime. Ongoing 
uncertainties resulting from global as we ll as domestic factors have necessitated a 
more cautious monetary policy stance by leading to a significant deterioration in 
inflation expectations. In order to prevent the materialization of the risks associated 
                                                
 
4 In order to address these risks, July Inflation Repor t presents inflation projections and the relevant policy 
response under alternative scenarios for food and energy prices.                                                                                       Central Bank of Turkey  
 11with the second round effects of rising in flation expectations, we have conducted a 
monetary tightening over the past three mont hs. Monetary tightening was effective in 
containing inflation expectations, as the det erioration in inflation expectations came 
to a halt in July. 
Current stance of monetary po licy supports disinflation. We expect inflation to 
remain at elevated levels in the short term before gradually moderating towards the 
targets. Our latest inflation forecasts sugges t that inflation targets of 7.5 percent, 6.5 
percent, and 5,5 percent set for the next th ree years in the Medium Term Program 
are attainable, even under quite conserva tive assumptions on food and energy 
prices. Adverse impacts of the supply side shocks on the economy will be more 
limited should all the economic  agents take these targets as a benchmark in forming 
their expectations.  
Prudent monetary policy is a necessary  but not a sufficient condition for 
attaining price stability. The support from fi scal policy and structural reforms are also 
critical in this respect. Sound fiscal policy has been one of the main factors in driving 
inflation down to single digits. The role of fiscal policy will continue to be critical in 
the road to price stability. Preserving the resilience of the economy, especially under 
current conditions, requires the continuati on of fiscal discipline and structural 
reforms. In this respect, the Eur opean Union accession process and the 
implementation of structural reforms env isaged in the economic program remain to 
be of utmost importance. In particular, adv ances in structural reforms, which would 
improve the quality of fiscal discipline and enhance the productivity, are monitored 
closely by the CBT with regard to their implications on macroeconomic and price 
stability. 
We have also attached, for your consider ation, our latest Inflation Report dated 
July 28th of 2008, which provides a more co mprehensive analysis of the issues 
presented in this open letter.
