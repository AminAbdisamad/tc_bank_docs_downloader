The Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) has been implementing an inflation
targeting regime since the beginning of 2006. Central Bank Law, as stipulated in the
Article 42, requires the CBT to be accountable for the non-fulfillment of inflation
targets. Inflation target for end-year 2008 was jointly set with the Government as 4
percent. To facilitate the accountability principle, our policy statement titled
“Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy in 2008” disclosed a quarterly path consistent
with the end-year 2008 targets along with an uncertainty band. In this context, any
breach of upper or lower limits of the band requires the CBT to write an open letter
to the Government, explaining the reasons for the breach and the measures to be
taken to ensure that inflation rate will return to levels within pre-established limits.
Inflation outturn as of June 2008 was 10.61 percent, breaching the upper limit
of the uncertainty band, which was set at 8.5 percent for the end of the second
quarter (Figure 1). Accordingly, this open letter explains the reasons for this breach
and presents the strategy adopted by the CBT to bring inflation back to the medium
term targets.

Reasons For Breaching the Target
The open letter dated April 2008 had presented a detailed explanation for
breaching the target in the first quarter of the year. The source of inflation has not
changed in the past quarter. Prolonged increases in food, energy and other
commodity prices have continued to exert significant upward pressures on headline
inflation. As a consequence 6.8 percentage points of the 10.61 percent annual CPI
inflation in June resulted from the direct impact of the rise in food and energy prices
(Figure 2).

Elevated food inflation was the main factor impeding the disinflation process.
Although domestic weather conditions turned more favorable in the first half of 2008,
lagged effects of last year’s poor harvest and continued elevation in agricultural
commodity prices continued to keep processed food inflation at high levels. 1 As a
consequence, processed food inflation displayed a cumulative increase of 14.2
percent in the first half of the year.

Developments in energy prices have been the other major factor driving
inflation in the second quarter. Soaring oil prices continued to lead to significant
hikes in the prices of domestic fuel products, also putting pressure on housing
utilities such as electricity and natural gas.
Services inflation displayed a limited rise in the first half of 2008. Food and
energy prices continued to exert upward pressures on the prices of catering and

The rise in core inflation in the second quarter should be viewed as a
temporary movement arising from the exchange rate pass-through, rather than
deterioration in the general price setting behavior. Ongoing difficulties in global credit
markets coupled with domestic uncertainties have led to a depreciation of Turkish
Lira vis-à-vis major currencies in the first four months of the year. As a
consequence, first round effects of exchange rate pass-through have been
significant on the headline inflation as well as on core inflation figures during the
March-May period. Yet, the recent rebound in Turkish lira and weakening domestic
demand has limited the overall pass-through and consequently core inflation
showed signs of easing in June. Currently, annual rate of increase in CPI excluding
food, energy, tobacco and gold items stands at 6.4 percent, confirming that the
breach of the inflation targets can be mostly attributed to factors beyond the control
of the monetary policy (Figure 4).

Reaction of Monetary Policy
In the open letter dated April 2008, we indicated that uncertainties in the global
economy, hikes in energy prices, and the risks to price setting behavior compelled
the monetary policy to be more responsive to the incoming information. The letter
revealed a clear tightening bias against increased risks related to the second round
effects of the supply side shocks. Food and energy prices continued to rise in the
second quarter of 2008 and financial markets remained under stress. In the
meantime domestic uncertainties have intensified, having further adverse impact on
the medium term inflation expectations. Accordingly, there has been a significant
upward surge in the medium term inflation expectations in the second quarter of
2008 (Figure 6).

In order to contain the deterioration in inflation expectations and to prevent the
materialization of the second round effects of supply-side shocks, the MPC
tightened monetary policy in the past three months, increasing the policy rates by a
cumulative of 150 basis points (Table 1). The monetary tightening was effective in
controlling expectations. Consequently, the deterioration in inflation expectations
came to a halt in July (Figure 6).

Inflation Outlook
Recent developments in supply and demand conditions have been in line with
our assessments presented in the previous letter. Although first quarter private
consumption growth at 7.3 percent appears quite strong in annual terms, the
seasonally adjusted figures point to an ongoing moderation in economic activity
(Figure 7). Also, recent readings on domestic sales, production and confidence
indicators suggest a similar outlook. 2

Data on consumer credits suggest that monetary conditions continue to be
restrictive. Consumer loans have been growing at a moderate pace compared to the
periods of vigorous domestic demand (Figure 8). The cautious monetary policy
stance, increased precautionary saving, and the tightening in global credit conditions
are likely to restrain credit expansion in the period ahead.

Overall, domestic demand conditions continue to support disinflation (Figure

After the significant weakening of the Turkish lira in the first four months of
2008 (Figure 10), exchange rates have reversed direction in the past two months,
easing to some extent potential pressures on tradable inflation resulting from the
exchange rate pass-through. In the April letter, the first round impact of the recent
depreciation was estimated to be close to 2-percentage points for the end-2008
headline inflation. The recent rebound in currency has led to a downward revision in
the estimated pass-through. We now anticipate a cumulative exchange passthrough of around 1.2 percent points for 2008, most of which has already been
materialized between March-May period.

Longer-term interest rates have also increased in the second quarter due to
rising risk premium and inflation expectations (Figure 11). Although higher interest
rates contain the domestic demand and support disinflation, the impact of the
heightened risk premium on the overall pricing behavior should be closely
monitored.

Baseline assumptions in the April Inflation Report envisaged a constant path
for oil prices around 105 USD per barrel over the forecast horizon. However, oil
prices continued to rise on the back of increasing international commodity prices,
necessitating an upward revision. Taking the average future prices in the first three
weeks of July as a benchmark, our baseline scenario for oil prices has been revised
to USD 140 per barrel. 3 This revision has increased the end-2008 inflation forecast
by 1.8 percentage points, and also added to the end-2009 forecasts 0.6 percentage
points.
2F2F

Our revised forecasts envisage slightly higher food inflation in 2008 and 2009
compared to the April Inflation Report. Although unprocessed food prices followed a
relatively favorable course, processed food inflation is likely to stay at high levels for
while, given the elevated course of agricultural commodity prices. Against this
backdrop, we have raised the assumptions for food inflation from 13 percent to 14
percent for the year 2008, and from 8 percent to 9 percent for the year 2009. These
changes have led to an upward revision in our inflation forecasts by about 30 basis
points, both for 2008 and 2009. The projections envisage gradually moderating food
inflation throughout the forecast horizon. In this context, assumption for 2010 food
inflation is 7 percent.

3

We also assume that the adjustment of electricity tariffs in the context of automatic pricing mechanism will be
compatible with the oil price scenario.

8

Central Bank of Turkey

Accordingly, we now forecast inflation to be around 10.6 percent at the end of
2008. Under the assumption of a limited tightening towards the end of 2008, our
medium term forecasts suggest that, with 70 percent probability, inflation will be
between 5,9 and 9.3 percent (mid-point 7,6) at the end of 2009, and between 4
percent and 7.8 per cent (mid-point 5.9) at the end of 2010 (Figure 12). Our inflation
forecast for mid-2011 is 5.4 percent. We expect non-food inflation to be lower than
these figures.

* The shaded region indicates the 70 percent confidence interval for the forecast.

To sum up, although economic activity in the past quarter have evolved in line
with our expectations, the significant increases in oil and processed food prices have
led to an upward revision in our forecasts. The main message of the forecast is that
preventing the materialization of potential second round effects and ensuring a
steady decline in inflation towards the medium term targets, requires the monetary
policy to maintain a cautious stance for a while.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information regarding the
inflation outlook may lead to a change in our policy stance. Therefore, the path for
the policy rates indicated above should not be perceived as a commitment on behalf
of the CBT.

Risks

9

Central Bank of Turkey

Our baseline scenario is based on quite conservative assumptions for food and
energy prices, implying that downside risks on these factors are as significant as
upside risks. 4 Should the upside risks materialize, monetary policy will be conducted
so as to minimize upside deviations from the targets. Downward surprises in food
and energy prices, on the other hand, will be perceived as an opportunity to bring
inflation back to target in a shorter period than envisaged in our baseline scenario.
3F3F

Despite the expected decline in inflation in the medium term, uncertainties exist
regarding the degree of inflation persistence. Long-lasting supply shocks have been
keeping headline inflation at elevated levels and thus increasing the risk of rising
backward looking schemes in the wage and price setting behavior. Although the
widening output gap should contain the second round effects of the supply shocks,
the exact pace of disinflation would still depend on the extent new inflation targets
serve as a strong reference for economic agents. Having this in mind, the CBT will
continue to focus on enhancing the credibility of the new inflation targets. In this
context, developments in the general pricing behavior and the underlying inflation
trends will be monitored closely.
International financial markets remain fragile and the credit conditions continue
to tighten up. The eventual impact of the financial turmoil on the global economic
activity is yet to be seen. Moreover, rising commodity prices continue to be a threat
for price stability. These uncertainties have been dampening the risk appetite and
thus slowing down the capital flows to emerging markets, leaving these economies
susceptible to shifts in the market sentiment. Domestic uncertainties have
exacerbated these effects, as manifested by the significant rise in the sovereign
credit risk of Turkey in the first half of the year, compared to the average risk
premium of emerging economies. The CBT will not display a sharp reaction to
temporary fluctuations in the financial markets, unless there is a long lasting
deterioration in expectations and/or a significant worsening in the general pricing
behavior.
Finally, our medium-term projections assume that government expenditures
will evolve in line with the official projections and that there will be no further
increases in indirect taxes or administered price adjustments, except those required
by the automatic pricing mechanisms. Any deviation from this framework may lead
to a revision of the outlook for inflation and monetary policy.

Conclusion
A protracted period of rising food and energy prices has been hampering our
disinflation efforts since the adoption of the inflation targeting regime. Ongoing
uncertainties resulting from global as well as domestic factors have necessitated a
more cautious monetary policy stance by leading to a significant deterioration in
inflation expectations. In order to prevent the materialization of the risks associated
4

In order to address these risks, July Inflation Report presents inflation projections and the relevant policy
response under alternative scenarios for food and energy prices.

Central Bank of Turkey

with the second round effects of rising inflation expectations, we have conducted a
monetary tightening over the past three months. Monetary tightening was effective in
containing inflation expectations, as the deterioration in inflation expectations came
to a halt in July.
Current stance of monetary policy supports disinflation. We expect inflation to
remain at elevated levels in the short term before gradually moderating towards the
targets. Our latest inflation forecasts suggest that inflation targets of 7.5 percent, 6.5
percent, and 5,5 percent set for the next three years in the Medium Term Program
are attainable, even under quite conservative assumptions on food and energy
prices. Adverse impacts of the supply side shocks on the economy will be more
limited should all the economic agents take these targets as a benchmark in forming
their expectations.
Prudent monetary policy is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for
attaining price stability. The support from fiscal policy and structural reforms are also
critical in this respect. Sound fiscal policy has been one of the main factors in driving
inflation down to single digits. The role of fiscal policy will continue to be critical in
the road to price stability. Preserving the resilience of the economy, especially under
current conditions, requires the continuation of fiscal discipline and structural
reforms. In this respect, the European Union accession process and the
implementation of structural reforms envisaged in the economic program remain to
be of utmost importance. In particular, advances in structural reforms, which would
improve the quality of fiscal discipline and enhance the productivity, are monitored
closely by the CBT with regard to their implications on macroeconomic and price
stability.
We have also attached, for your consideration, our latest Inflation Report dated
July 28th of 2008, which provides a more comprehensive analysis of the issues
presented in this open letter.
