THE CBRT PRESS RELEASE
ON
TURKISH LIRA DEPOSIT BUYING AUCTIONS PROGRAM FOR
SEPTEMBER 2004

In September 2004, the Central Bank will continue to conduct Turkish lira deposit
buying auctions with a standard four-week maturity, which are held as a supplement to its
existing instruments at Interbank Money Market with the aim of boosting its efforts to
sterilize the excess Turkish lira liquidity.
As in August 2004, Turkish lira deposit buying auctions with a standard four-week
maturity will be held on Wednesdays in September 2004. There will be no upper limit at each
auction.
