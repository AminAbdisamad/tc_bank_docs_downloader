SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 21 January 2014

Inflation Developments
1. In December, consumer prices increased by 0.46 percent, while annual
inflation rose to 7.40 percent. Energy prices were influential in this
development and there was no significant change in the contribution of other
main groups to the rise in annual inflation. In this period, core inflation
indicators continued to follow a downward course as in November.
2. Annual food group inflation receded to 9.67 percent. In December, annual
unprocessed food group inflation remained flat at 12.88 percent, while items
other than fresh fruits and vegetables saw widespread price hikes. Processed
food prices increased by 0.73 percent due to the bread and cereals group,
while the group’s annual inflation declined to 7.11 percent. Leading indicators
for January suggest that annual food group inflation will remain elevated
because of the impact of adverse weather conditions on fresh fruit and
vegetable prices.
3. In December, energy prices rose by 2.35 percent mainly owing to sharp
increases in LPG and bottled gas prices. Moreover, the recent depreciation of
the Turkish lira caused gas and diesel prices to rise. As a result, annual
energy inflation recorded the lowest year-end level of the last four years
despite rising to 5.15 percent.
4. In December, services prices increased by 0.39 percent, and the group’s
annual inflation came in at 7.98 percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (the
Committee) judged that, despite the favorable course of energy inflation
throughout the year, wage increases and the recovery in domestic demand
were influential in the rise of services inflation. However, it is noted that recent
seasonally adjusted data indicate a slowdown in the underlying trend of
services inflation.
5. Meanwhile, annual core goods inflation fell to 6.20 percent in December due to
the downward contribution of clothing prices and the waning effects of the
Turkish lira depreciation. Seasonally adjusted data also showed that the
underlying trend of the group’s inflation was on a downward path. However,
the resumed depreciation of the Turkish lira as of mid-December and

January’s tax adjustments for automobiles may deteriorate the outlook for core
goods inflation. In fact, leading indicators have recently pointed to a significant
increase in prices of durable goods, especially automobiles.
6. In sum, given that core inflation indicators may show a marked increase in
January, it is noted that inflation will remain significantly above the 5 percent
target in the short term due to unfavorable food prices as well.

Factors Affecting Inflation
7. Recent data releases suggest that final domestic demand continued to grow
moderately in the fourth quarter. The industrial production index compensated
the October fall with a rise in November. Although recently there have been
sharp volatilities in seasonally adjusted industrial production due to religious
holidays, on the whole, the industrial production index posted a modest
increase. It should be noted that this trend is almost equal to the average
growth rate seen since early 2012.
8. The moderate trend in private consumption demand continued in the last
quarter of the year. Production of consumer goods was down while imports of
consumer goods were up during October-November compared to the previous
quarter. Automobile sales were higher throughout the fourth quarter than the
average of the previous quarter. Total sales of automobiles and light
commercial vehicles suggest that vehicle sales were virtually flat over the
fourth quarter. While down from the previous quarter, sales of appliances
remained elevated in the fourth quarter.
9. Indicators for investment demand followed a relatively favorable path in the
final quarter. Production of capital goods went slightly up during OctoberNovember compared to the previous quarter. Production of capital goods
excluding vehicles, an indicator for the underlying trend, posted a larger
increase than total capital goods. Similarly, there were increases in imports of
capital goods as well. The expectation for fixed capital investment spending
asked in the Business Tendency Survey continued to rise for the fourth
consecutive month and surpassed the third-quarter level in the fourth quarter.
10. Survey indicators for the final quarter suggest that economic activity continues
to recover. In fact, both the Business Tendency Survey’s past-three-month
production question and the PMI index exceeded their third-quarter averages.
The BTS’ three-month-ahead order expectations increased significantly for
both domestic and export markets.

11. Recent indicators suggest that exports continue to grow modestly. In fact, the
non-gold export volume index was up in October-November from the thirdquarter average. PMI indicators point to a global recovery, while world import
demand is surging. The recovery of the euro area, Turkey’s leading trading
partner accounting for a substantial portion of Turkish exports, and the
improving global growth outlook indicate that net exports may make a positive
contribution to growth in the upcoming period.
12. The Committee stated that the recent hike in risk premiums and exchange
rates might put pressure on private demand in the first quarter of 2014. In fact,
the preliminary CNBC-e consumer confidence index for the first fifteen days of
January shows deterioration in consumer sentiment about current economic
conditions and future expectations. However, it is noted that the expected
recovery of external demand will restrict the slowdown in total demand.
Accordingly, the composition of growth is expected to support the decline in
both inflation and current account balance in the upcoming period.
13. Seasonally adjusted unemployment rates fell in October 2013 thanks to
growing non-farm employment. Although the uptrend in unemployment halted,
the rise in non-farm employment is restricted to certain sectors. Employment
remains weak in the industrial sector, while the increase in non-farm
employment came mostly from construction and services sectors. Leading
indicators for labor markets show signs of a moderately growing employment
for November and December. Yet, global economic uncertainties and
domestic political developments may remain a constraint to investment and
employment growth for the upcoming period

Monetary Policy and Risks
14. The meeting involved an assessment of the January Inflation Report forecasts.
According to the Committee, recent data suggest that final domestic demand
and exports continued to grow at a moderate pace during the fourth quarter. It
was stated that the cautious monetary policy stance, the announced
macroprudential measures, and weak capital flows lead to a gradual slowdown
in loan growth. Combined with the impact of recent domestic uncertainties,
private demand is expected to slow down in the first quarter. Meanwhile, the
expected recovery in the economic activity in Europe should have a positive
impact on the external demand. Accordingly, the decline in the current account
deficit excluding gold trade is expected to be more significant in 2014.

15. The Committee closely monitors the impact of the recent increase in the risk
premium on the inflation outlook and expectations. Inflation is likely to hover
above the 5 percent target for some time due to recent tax adjustments and
lagged effects of exchange rate developments. Moreover, the volatility in
unprocessed food prices adds to the uncertainty regarding inflation forecasts.
16. The Committee stated that the liquidity stance should be tightened to align
inflation outlook with the medium term targets. It was indicated that, given the
recently heightened uncertainties, designing a flexible mechanism would be
more appropriate. To this end, it was stated that interbank money market
interest rates will materialize at 9 percent during additional monetary tightening
days, instead of 7.75 percent. In this respect, Central Bank lending rate (the
marginal funding rate) will be announced and implemented at 9 percent,
instead of 7.75 percent during the additional tightening days.
17. Moreover, the Committee indicated that the upper limit of the amount of
funding provided at stable funding rate-1 may be removed due to the
increased funding need of the financial system in the recent period.
18. The Committee closely monitors inflation expectations and the pricing
behavior. The slowdown in domestic demand is expected to contain the effect
of the cost-push shocks on inflation to some extent in the coming period.
However, lagged effects of the exchange rate movements and the unfavorable
course of food prices are likely to cause inflation to remain above the target for
an extended period, which may result in higher rigidity in expectations and
stronger inflation inertia. Materialization of such a scenario and deterioration of
pricing behavior may prompt the Committee to implement the necessary
tightening in the monetary policy stance.
19. On the other hand, should these uncertainties and the increase in the risk
premium last for a long time, the economy may face a pronounced slowdown
through the confidence and balance-sheet channels. Should such a risk
materialize, the Central Bank will pursue a stabilizing policy by using its policy
instruments to reduce the intermediation costs of the banks.
20. The Committee closely monitors developments on fiscal policy and tax
adjustments with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. Inflation
forecasts presented in the baseline scenario take the framework outlined in
the Medium Term Program as given. Accordingly, it is assumed that fiscal
discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in
administered prices in the forthcoming period. A revision of the monetary
policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal stance deviate significantly

from this framework, and consequently, has an adverse effect on the mediumterm inflation outlook.
21. Maintaining the cautious stance in fiscal and financial sector policies is critical
to the resilience of our economy against current uncertainties. Strengthening
structural reforms that will ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and
reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability in the medium
term. Steps taken in this regard will also provide more room for maneuvering
the monetary policy and improve social welfare by keeping interest rates of
long-term government securities permanently at low levels. In this respect,
implementation of the structural reforms required by the Medium Term
Program remains to be of utmost importance.
