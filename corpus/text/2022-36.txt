Measures 
20 August  2022 No: 2022-36 
 
Reserve requirement and liquidity requirement practices involving the appropriate on and off-
balance sheet items of banks and oth er financial institutions are among the fundamental duties 
and powers of the Central Bank as laid down by Article 4 of the Law No. 1211 on the Central Bank 
of the Republic of Türkiye.  
In order to support financial stability and strengthen the monetary transmission mechanism, the 
Central Bank has been strengthening  its macroprudential toolkit with reserve requirement and 
Turkish lira denominated securit ies maintenance practices , involving both a sset and liability items.  
In its press release of 26 May 2022 , the CBRT announced that it would implement collateral and 
liquidity  policy actions, the review process of which is finalized. Accordingly, pursuant to  the 
Communique No. 2022/20  of 10 June 2022 , banks started to maintain Turkish lira -denominated 
securities for foreign currency deposits/ participation funds. Within the scope of this regulation, 
banks maintain securities at ratios set according to their targets of conversion to Turkish lira 
deposit /participation accounts. The first maintenance period started on 29 July 2022.  
In its press release of 18 August  2022 , the Monetary Policy Committee announced that the rate of 
credit growth and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes were c losely monitored 
and the recent increase in spread between policy rate and the loan interest rate was considered to reduce the effectiveness of monetary transmission. In this context, the Committee announced 
that the macroprudential policy set would be fur ther strengthened,  and the credit, collateral and 
liquidity policy actions, of which the review process is finalized, would continue to be implemented 
to support the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism .  
As a result of the evaluations,  the CBRT has made the following decisions for  loans subject to the 
reserve requirement practice the Bank stated in its press release of  23 April 2022 : 
a) The res erve requirement maintenance being applied at a ratio of 20%  will be replaced 
by maintenance of securities at 30% for banks to enhance the efficiency of the practice,   
b) Securities  equaling  the loan amount exceeding the loan growth rate of 10%  as of 30 
December 2022  compared to 29 July 2022 will be maintained for a period of one year , 
c) In case t he types of loans that are excluded  are not  extended against expenditure, such 
loans will be subject to the securit ies maintenance practice .  
Additionally  the CBRT has decided that:  
d) For commercial loans to be extended from the publication date of the Communique until 
the end of 2022, securities will be maintained  based on :  
• 20% of the loan amount to be extended at an annual compound interest rat e 1.4 
times higher than the CBRT- released annual compound reference rate , and  
• 90% of the loan amount to be extended at an annual compound interest rate 1.8
