Press Release On the Maximum Interest 
Rates for Credit Cards in Q 2 2019 
5 April  2019, No: 201 9-14 
 
The monthly maximum contractual interest rate for the credit card borrowings has been revised 
as 2.15 percent for the Turkish lira and 1. 72 percent for foreign exchange transactions, whereas 
the monthly maximum overdue i nterest rate will be 2.65  percent for the Turkish lira and 2. 22 
percent for foreign exchange transactions, to be effective from 1 April 2019 . 
 Banks in Turkey, as is the case in other countries, charge higher interest rates for credit card borrowing than they do for consumer loans. The CBRT, therefore, advises credit card holders with short -term credit needs to seek a consumer loan rather than borrowing on personal credit cards.
