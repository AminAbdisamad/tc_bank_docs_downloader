3. The six-month average of seasonally adjusted inflation was 1.2 percent in WPI and 0.8 in CPI.
The mentioned average rates of increase correspond to 15.5 percent and 9.6 percent in annual terms.
In the same period again, the average rate of increase in seasonally adjusted CPI excluding food

became 0.9 percent, which corresponds to 10.7 percent in annual terms (Figure İ).

Developments in Consumer Prices

4. Inflation figures of June 2004, strengthens the view that the effects of recent cost-push pressures
on consumer inflation will be limited. Increases in seasonally adjusted CPI excluding food was
recorded as 0.9 percent. Increases in CPI excluding food, which mostly followed a horizontal course in
2004, were especially affected by the rigidity in services group prices but remained in line with the

inflation target in the first six months of the year with a monthly average of 0.9 percent.

5. In June there were mainly three factors affecting CPI sub-items. These were: (i) as also previously
stated, the rigidity in services group prices, (ii) increase in public prices especially oil prices, and (ili)

prices of durable goods.

6. As of the first six months of 2004, the gap between the rate of increase in goods and services
prices continues to mount. By the end of 2003 annual price increases in goods and services group
were 15.5 percent and 24 percent respectively, and they became 4.7 percent and iİ7.3 percent in
June 2004 (Figure 2). Also in June restaurant and hotel prices increased by 1.2 percent and rents
increased by 1.3 percent. Especially the trend exhibited by the rent increases in the first half of the

year approximately corresponds to 17 a percent in annual terms.

7. Meanwhile, the effects of exchange rates are observed most clearly in petroleum prices. In the
period where TL appreciated, petroleum prices were stabilized, even rolled back by increasing tax
incomes. However, along with the rise in exchange rates, the hike in petroleum prices became
inevitable in order to avoid tax losses. The effects of the rise observed in petroleum prices in June will

reflect on July inflation.

8. Another important development observed in June CPI figures is the decline in durable goods

prices. The drop observed in the prices of durable goods sector, which is among the sectors that are
most sensitive to exchange rates, iİs remarkable in terms of pass-through effect. So, It can be
concluded that companies have not reflected the cost increases on their prices since they made their
productions and imports by looking into the future at a time when TL was dear, combined also with

the increased competition in this sector.

Developments in Wholesale Prices

9. In addition to the WPI figures in May, those in June also confirm the idea that agricultural prices
would compensate for high rates of increase observed in the first four months of the year with high
drop-out rates in the summer. The inflation trend in WPI excluding agriculture increased in the second
guarter of the year compared to the first guarter due to the rise İin exchange rates and public price

increases, however it has lost pace in June compared to May (Figure 4).

10. Agricultural prices dropped by 8.1 percent in June. The seasonally adjusted inflation rates indicate
that agricultural prices increased cumulatively by 10.8 percent in the first four months of the year and
declined by 3.3 percent in May and June. The limited effect of agricultural prices is expected to

maintain its course during summer.

11. While the effects of exchange rates are clearly observed on public manufacturing industry prices,
petroleum products manufacturing and chemicals production reached a peak. The price increase in
food manufacturing realized relatively high due to the lagged effects of the rises in tea and sugar
prices. Whereas the prices, which dropped by 3.2 percent in the main metal industry, point out to a

halt in the rapid rise observed in this group in the first five months of the year.

12. In January-July period, accumulated WPI increase in public sector was 9.İ percent. As for
manufacturing industry prices, public sector price increase was recorded as İl percent during the
same period. Recent price increases made in line with the budget target played a role in these

increases as well.

13. The rate of increase in prices of private manufacturing industry accelerated relatively in the
second guarter of the year. Average rate of monthiy increase in the first six months was İ percent.
However, analyzing in terms of three-month periods, the rate of increase, which was recorded to be
0.5 percent in the first guarter, rose to 1.5 percent in the second guarter of the year. Cost-push
pressures were effective in this rise but price increases stipulated in the second guarter by the firms,
which did not respond to the appreciation of Turkish lira by cutting down their prices in the first

guarter, remained well below the level of increase in exchange rate.

14. Energy prices maintained their recent course and rose by 0.1 percent. Prices in this group
decreased by 2.2 percent compared to June 2003. Price increase in natural gas, which is to be
effective as of June i, is expected to exert a pressure on prices of this group next month. However,
the course of electricity prices bears more importance iİn terms of both the energy group and

production costs.

IT, OUTLOOK
15. As of the first half of 2004, prospects for the attalnability of the year-end inflation target are
strengthening. Above all, low level of inflation observed in the first half of the year took place along
with the high rate of growth. Undoubtediy, the greatest contribution to this development comes from
the current economic program that has been implemented for the last three years. It is of great
importance to stick with such a rewarding program in an enduring manner by particulariy focusing

more on structural reforms.

16. An analysis of growth figures for the first guarter of the year in terms of demand components
indicates that the greatest contribution to the GDP growth in the first three-month period of 2004
comes from private expenditures. The recovery in private spending resulted from high rates of
consumption spending particularly on durable goods as well as from the rapid rise in investments on
machinery-eguipment. High level of demand for durable goods did not lead to a marked inflationary
pressure as İit occurred concurrentiy with the strengthening trend in Turkish lira. Meanwhile, the rise
in production of investment goods will contribute to the fight against inflation through the upsurge in

efficiency and potential production.

17. The increase in private consumption is forecasted to have continued during the second guarter of
the year and accordingiy the capacity utilization ratios are predicted to have realized at high levels.
Nevertheless, as expressed by the first guarter growth figures, the recovery in the economy has not
yet been observed to have spread to those sectors producing semi-durable and non-durable goods.
The driving force of economic growth during this period has mostly been the fast production increase
in the automotive and white goods sectors. While this development has a number of reasons, two

basic issues have come to the forefront:

() The relative price differentiation attributable to the appreciation of the
Turkish lira observed in goods that are subject to foreign trade and that use

a high ratio of foreign inputs.
(ii) The fast decline in consumer credit interest rates in 2004, compared to the

previous year.

18. It is predicted that developments such as the fluctuations observed in financial markets after the
change in global liguidity trends in April and May, the increases in credit interest rates and the decline
in consumer confidence will contribute to a controlled recovery in the durable consumption sector.
And although growth rate is expected to slow down in the second half of the year compared to the
first half, the GNP growth rates for 2004 will still end up above program targets. Having analyzed
consumer credit developments during the last period in a thorough manner together with their subitems, a tendency of slowdown was observed. Yet, it is coosely monitored whether these developments
stemmed from temporary factors and/or the tendency displayed a meaningful breaking point.
However, in all cases, it is believed that demand conditions will not be supportive in terms of inflation
in the second half of the year as much as they were in the last three years, and that continuing

productivity increase is significant for the decline in inflation to carry on.

19. It is observed that together with the changing exchange rate regime, nominal exchange rate
indexation behavior weakened and economic units adopted a more rational pricing policy. Academic
studies demonstrate that periods of low and stable inflation may have significant effects on the pricing
behavior of firms. Stronger expectations for the decline in inflation to be a lasting one will generate
the belief that changes in prices and costs will be temporary, as a conseguence of which the passthrough effect may weaken. In this sense, the fight against inflation and floating exchange rate policy
are believed to bring about a structural change in the exchange rate-inflation relationship. Other
factors contributing to the relative weakening of the pass-through effect are that fiscal policy
perceives targeted inflation as an endogenous parameter, a more competitive environment, and the
break in inflation expectations. As a matter of fact, May and June inflation data show that the passthrough effect of cost-push developments now materialize relatively slower compared to the past.
However, the fact that the pass-through effect began to take place in a delayed fashion in recent

years on account of the above cited reasons, call for more caution vis-â-vis the total final effect issue.

20. As repeatedily emphasized in our previous press releases and reports, monetary policy is focused
on the harmony of future inflation with targeted inflation. In line with this, the low inflation figures in
the first half of the year are evaluated within the scope of the information they contain with regards
the 2004 and 2005 inflation. The information held with respect to the future by the inflation figures for

the first half of the year and certain other risks are as follows:
21. Ongoing rigidity in the services sector continues to pose a risk for the 2005 inflation. For
example, annual rent increases being around 21.4 percent while annual CPI is at 8.9 percent, show
that despite the significant distance covered in the fight against inflation, it will take time to fully break
the inertia in some sectors. Within this context, price rigidity in sectors such as education and rent

reguires to be carefully monitored in terms of the 2005 inflation.

22. It is projected that the effects of the rise in costs due to changes in the prices of raw materials
and exchange rates as well as the increments in the prices of petroleum products will mostly become
apparent in July. Therefore, taking into account last year's inflation figures in July, which were rather
low, it is expected that annual inflation figures pertaining to July 2004 would probabliy display a rise.
Although the indirect and lagged effects of the rise in petroleum products on inflation are believed to
remain at a level not to jeopardize the end-year inflation target, it is still projected that these effects

would be somehow more than “negligible”.

23. It is now evident that agricultural prices and food prices would assist the downward trend in
inflation in 2004. Undoubtediy, as it is not possible to foresee seasonal conditions, it is very important
to act cautiously about agricultural prices and food prices. As these sectors provide very İittle
information about the future course of inflation, they can lead to mistakes especially in periods when
they are dominant in main indices. Therefore, it can be asserted that the current favorable course of

the food prices provides very little information in terms of 2005 inflation as well.

24. The manufacturing industry prices, which have been accelerating constantiy for a while, are
estimated to slow down in the second half of the year. The rapid rise observed in manufacturing
industry prices in the first half would probably make a temporary pressure on CPI inflation in the
second half. However, electricity prices would probably not increase for guite a while and the rise in
main metal and petroleum raw materials would decelerate, which together would help cost pressures
remain limited. As a result, it is believed that the recent developments in wholesale prices could effect
the future CPI inflation through costs, however, it is firmly believed that such an effect would remain
limited as is the case İn exchange rate-inflation relation and would not reach a level that might
jeopardize the end-year inflating target. However, with a long-term perspective, the mentioned

developments are very closely monitored for 2005 inflation.

25. As a conseguence, it is projected that although high capacity utilization ratios, the acceleration in
public prices and relative recovery in consumption expenditures will start to be effective on inflation as
of the next few months, the general trend of inflation will not exceed the targeted rates thanks to
increased productivity and investments coupled with deceleration in the prices of raw materials and
favorable course in inflation expectations. Yet, the cumulative inflation for the first six months of the
year, which became only 3.1 percent, provides a room for maneuver in the face of prospective

exogenous shocks.

26. The inflation figures obtained in the first half of the year confirms that the achievements so far

are not of temporary nature. However, further deepening of the structural reforms is now more

important than ever for attaining macroeconomic stability. Arrangements intended for boosting
productivity, completion of reforms in public sector, wiping up of bureaucratic hurdles before
investments, tax and social security reforms, steps to be taken towards improving financial sector and
public conviction that the commitments made thereto are credible are crucial. The serious steps taken
towards social security and financial sector reforms are highly appreciated. Fortifying the mechanisms
that ensures the sustainability of these steps is of course very important. Within this framework, it
should be highlighted that following a program, which aims at ensuring sustainability of achievements
and focuses on structural reforms by outlining structural criteria within a general as well as a mediumterm plan is very important.
