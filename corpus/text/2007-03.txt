SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 16 January 2007
Inflation Developments
1. Inflation continued its recent downward course in December and declined to
9.65 percent at the end of the year. The main determinant of consumer price
developments in December is the decline in clothing and footwear prices that is
beyond seasonal trends. On the other hand, the annual rate of inflation in
unprocessed food prices increased. Meanwhile, owing to the stable course of
the New Turkish Lira and the slowdown in demand, the decline in annual
inflation of durable goods prices continued in December.
2. The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has noted that uncertainties
regarding unprocessed food prices continue. The deceleration in the rate of
increase in unprocessed food prices in the last few months came to a halt in
December. Persistence of adverse weather conditions coupled with the recent
slump in agricultural production, especially in grain production, may have an
adverse effect on food prices in the upcoming period. Within this framework, the
Committee considers that food prices continue to be a risk factor for inflation.
3. The Committee has also noted that the decline in oil prices affected the inflation
outlook favorably. Fuel oil prices decreased by 10.18 percent in the AugustNovember period. However, energy prices related to the housing group
increased by 3.19 percent in the last quarter due to the rapid increases in the
prices of natural gas and solid fuel items and this caused energy inflation to rise
in the last two months of the year. The Committee concludes that the recent
favorable developments in oil prices are not yet significant enough to change
the medium-term inflation outlook, given that there is still a considerable amount
of uncertainty regarding oil prices and lagged effects of the past cumulative
price increases.
4. The annual rate of increase of the special CPI Aggregate-H (CPI excluding
energy, unprocessed food products, alcoholic beverages, tobacco products and
gold) declined to 8.89 percent in December. This development can be attributed
to the decline in clothing and footwear prices that is beyond seasonal trends,
and by the significant decrease in prices of durable goods. Although it is
projected that the monthly rate of changes in the H-index may exhibit some
volatility in the upcoming period due to seasonal price movements, the overall
trend is expected to be downwards in the medium term.

5. In 2006, the decline in annual inflation of services was quite limited, due to the
persistent high inflation in the prices of rents and accommodation services. The
possibility of the continuance of this trend in the upcoming period emerges as a
risk factor for disinflation.

Factors Affecting Inflation
6. The Committee evaluates the recent data as broadly consistent with the outlook
presented in the October Inflation Report.
7. The slowdown in private consumption demand continues. After declining
sharply in the third quarter as a result of depreciation of the YTL, increasing
credit interest rates, and lower consumer confidence, the demand for durable
goods increased moderately in the fourth quarter. Although seasonally adjusted
data suggest that automobile sales are stronger than the previous quarter, the
annual growth rate still remains negative. The data for the October-November
period indicate a modest increase in white goods sales compared to the third
quarter. Business Tendency Survey (BTS) indicators also point to a sluggish
recovery in private consumption in the last quarter of 2006.
8. Although consumer credit, which had stopped its rapid growth in the third
quarter in line with the rise in interest rates, has shown some tendency to
recover in the fourth quarter, there is still a significant slowdown in the rate of
increase in consumer credit in annual terms. While housing loans grow at a low
rate, vehicle loans continue to decline in real terms. These developments are in
line with the slowdown in private consumption demand. The recent rise in credit
utilization stems mainly from items other than housing and vehicle credits. This
suggests that the coincidence of the New Year and the religious feast holidays
has caused consumers to use consumer credits and credit cards intensively to
meet their increased expenses. In other words, the recent hike in consumer
credit does not point to a rebound; it can be largely explained by seasonal
factors.
9. External demand remains relatively strong. The net exports made a positive
contribution to overall economic activity in the second half of the year.
Sustained increases in labor productivity coupled with the robust economic
activity in the EU, and the euro’s strength against the US dollar support the
export growth. The leading indicators pertaining to January suggest that
external demand remains strong as of early 2007.
10. Industrial production continued to increase during the last quarter of 2006 with
the help of strong external demand. The high annual growth rate in industrial
production in November can be explained by the higher number of working
days compared to the same month of the previous year, due to the lunarcalendar-based religious holiday. However, the seasonally adjusted figures
point to a rise in production as well. The high capacity utilization ratios in

manufacturing industry in December and the benign expectations of companies
indicate that the rise in industrial production continued in December as well,
pointing that industrial production has kept growing in the last quarter of 2006.
Moreover, according to the BTS, the companies’ expectations for production
volume for the next three months in seasonally adjusted terms also exhibit
positive signals for industrial production.
11. The tightening in financial conditions, the increase in the relative prices of
investment goods and the expectation of deceleration in domestic demand
caused investment demand to slowdown in the second half of the year. The
leading indicators pertaining to investment demand point to a rise in investment
in the last quarter in seasonally adjusted terms. Sales of commercial vehicles
increased in the last quarter compared to the third quarter. Imports of capital
goods, as well as production and imports of machinery-equipment, office
equipment, and electrical machinery and appliances in the October-November
period exceeded those in the third quarter. The statistics on the construction
permits and non-metallic minerals sector production that are closely related to
construction investments indicate that robust activity in the construction sector
continues.
Moreover, the BTS indicators do not point to a significant
deterioration in investment expenditure tendency over the next twelve-month
period as of November, thereby supporting this view.
12. To sum up, although economic activity has shown a tendency to recover in the
last quarter of 2006, overall demand conditions continue to support disinflation.
Despite the relatively strong course of external demand and increasing public
expenditure, total demand slowed down compared to previous periods. The
annual growth rate of output is expected to be low in the last quarter of 2006,
due to the high base in end 2005. It is projected that the economic activity will
continue to recover gradually in the upcoming period.
13. Unit labor costs in the private manufacturing sector continued to decline since
productivity increases were higher than the rise in real wages. This, in turn,
continued to support the disinflation process in the third quarter of 2006. A
similar trend is expected in the last quarter of the year.
14. Recently available data indicate that the rate of decline in agricultural
employment started to slow down significantly, while the employment in other
sectors continued to rise. However, the fact that the unemployment rate in nonagricultural sectors is still as high as 11.9 percent suggests that the rise in
employment has not yet reached a level that would exert pressure on inflation.
On the other hand, the recent wage adjustments that are above the inflation
target may hinder the disinflation process via its impact on expectations and
production costs.
15. Inflation expectations continue to improve. The distribution of inflation
expectations that displayed a wide dispersion in June and July gained a more

consolidated structure in recent months. Agents still expect that the disinflation
process will continue in the medium term. Nevertheless, medium-term inflation
expectations are still significantly above the targets.

Monetary Policy and Risks
16. The Committee assesses that under the current circumstances monetary policy
stance in Turkey is non-accommodative. The decline in inflation expectations
has continued to tighten the monetary conditions in the last quarter of 2006. In
other words, although policy rates remained unchanged, the real rates have
continued to increase. Longer-term interest rates such as the interest rates on
government securities and consumer loans stayed at higher levels.
17. We expect aggregate demand conditions to support the underlying disinflation
process in the next couple of quarters. However, there are some risks regarding
the medium-term inflation outlook.
18. The main risk factor for the medium-term inflation outlook can be stated as
higher-than-expected inflation inertia, as currently manifested in the inertia in
medium-term inflation expectations and services inflation. We expect that
slowdown in the aggregate demand will induce a gradual decline in services
inflation in the period ahead. However, given the low relative productivity growth
in the sevices sector, backward-looking price setting behavior, and the
sensitivity of services prices to wage hikes, the developments in prices of
services should continue to be closely monitored. The recent wage hikes have
highlighted these risks even more. Given that we plan to bring inflation down
from 10 percent to 4 percent in a fairly short period of time, the Committe
judges that the possibility of a sustained persistence in high services inflation
stands as a major risk for the medium-term outlook. Realization of such a risk
could require keeping the tight policy stance for an extended period.
19. Another risk for the inflation outlook is the uncertainty regarding the impact of
the monetary policy on aggregate demand. Lags in monetary policy
transmission are time variant across countries, and the Turkish economy is no
exception. The sizeable slowdown in the third quarter of 2006 was a result of
lower confidence due to financial market volatility in May-June period, rather
than an outcome of the tightened monetary policy. Although the tightening
exercised since June 2006 started to be effective on private demand recently,
the extent and the duration of the slowdown in overall economic activity remains
to be seen. There are also some uncertainties related to the behavior of
government spending, which could represent an upside risk to aggregate
demand, and therefore inflation in 2007. In this respect, the MPC has been
closely monitoring the macroeconomic impact of the developments in incomes
policy as well as public sector non-interest expenditures.

20. Another risk factor that may delay attaining the medium-term targets is the
possibility of a sudden change in the global financial market sentiment. Global
liquidity is still the major factor in shaping risk appetite and volatility in financial
markets. Currently, the concerns over high inflation and thus higher interest
rates in the United States seem to have diminished. However, a faster than
envisaged slowdown in the world economy or disorderly developments owing to
global imbalances still remain as possible scenarios that may lead to another
wave of portfolio shock in emerging markets. The Committee will revise the
policy rates if these shocks turns out to have lasting effects on the medium-term
inflation outlook.
21. There are favorable scenarios regarding the inflation outlook as well as
unfavorable ones. Turkey is a net commodity importer. Although a slowdown in
the global economic growth or a further easing in commodity prices could have
an immediate adverse impact on domestic inflation through its impact on the
global risk appetite, it will also lead to a positive terms of trade shock and thus
to a more favorable outlook in the medium term.
22. In light of these developments, the Committee decided to keep the policy rates
on hold. The Committee has assessed that meeting the medium term inflation
targets necessitates the maintenance of the cautious policy stance. The gap
between medium-term inflation expectations and the targets, the risks related to
services price inflation, and the uncertainties in global economy necessitate
keeping the tight policy stance.
23. The Committee closely monitors the lagged effects of the monetary tightening
since June 2006. Moreover, the potential impact of the progress in the structural
reform agenda and developments in incomes policy as well as public sector
non-interest expenditures on inflation and inflation expectations are carefully
evaluated. The Central Bank will not hesitate to tighten monetary policy in case
of any new developments that would adversely affect the medium-term inflation
outlook.
24. The continuation of the European Union accession process and the sustained
implementation of the structural reforms envisaged in the economic program
are still crucial. Developments related to the structural reforms that would
enhance the quality of fiscal discipline in the medium and long run are followed
closely from the perspective of both macroeconomic stability and price stability.
Continued determination in implementing the decisive steps taken in these
areas in recent years will increase the resilience of the economy against
possible changes in the global conjuncture.
