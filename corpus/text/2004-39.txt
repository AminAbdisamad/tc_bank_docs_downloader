3. The last six-month average of seasonalliy adjusted inflation was 1.10 percent in WPI and 0.82 in
CPI. The mentioned average rates of increase correspond to 14 percent and İ0.3 percent in annual
terms. In the same period again, the average rate of increase in seasonaliy adjusted CPI excluding

food became 0.69 percent, which corresponds to 8.6 percent in annual terms (Figure 1İ).

Developments in Consumer Prices

4, In September, CPI inflation remained very limited, although goods and services group prices had
to increase considerabiy for seasonal reasons. The increases in all prices of goods group (primarily in
food and clothing prices) that were rather below the seasonal tendency affected this development.
Seasonally adjusted food prices fell by 0.9 percent, clothing prices by 0.8 percent in September.
Despite the increase in the average US dollar exchange rate of some 3.5 percent during the last two
months, the decline in the prices of durable consumption goods continue: The durable group prices

retreated by 1.9 percent in September, after the 2.5 percent decline in August.

5. Furthermore, the İ0 percent increase in the education materials group pushed up the goods
prices in September. Besides, with a 2.2 percent increase in September, as in August, furniture prices
under the household goods group were one of the items recording the highest increase in the goods
group. Cumulative price increase iİn this group reached 14.4 percent as of September. Within the
framework of these developments, monthiy goods price increase realized as 0.4 percent. When
seasonaliy adjusted, this figure declines to —0.7 percent. Thelimited increase in goods prices despite

seasonal effects, show that there is no strong demand pressure on prices.

6. Meanwhile, with an increase of 1.8 percent, services group prices advanced much more than the
goods group prices in September. Seasonally adjusted service prices increase realized at 1.0 percent,
in line with the average level of the last three months. The item that recorded the highest increase in
this group is the rents, which rose by 2.5 percent also owing to seasonality. Cumulative rent increase,
having reached 13.9 percent as of September, realized 9.1 points higher than the 4.8 percent

cumulative increase in CPI during the same period.
7. The highest increase in services group after the rents came from education services prices with a
2.1 percent of rise. The cumulative increase İn education services prices from January through
September 2004 became 13.5 percent, a very close figure to that of rents prices. However, in annual
terms, the price increases in these two groups became differentiated in September: while annual
increase in rents dropped from 20.8 percent in August down to 19.8 percent, that İn education
services prices came down to 13.6 percent from 21.6 percent. The rapid fall in the increase in
education services prices owes to the limited rise in the tuition fees of nursery schools and

kindergartens.

8. Within this frtamework, the difference between the rates of increase İn the prices of goods and
prices of services prevails. As of September, while the seasonalliy adjusted cumulative increase in the
prices of goods is 4.7 percent, that in the prices of services reached i10.4 percent. In year-on-year
terms, prices of goods came down to 5.6 percent while prices of services dropped down to 15.3

percent (Figure 2).

9. To conclude, in September, seasonally adjusted CPI and CPI excluding food prices decreased by
1.0 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively, compared to the average values recorded in the first eight
months of the year. After a three-month halt, CPI inflation started to decrease again and became 9
percent in September. Meanwhile, CPI increase excluding food came down to 9.7 percent, in annual

terms (Figure 3).

Developments in Wholesale Prices

10. In September, seasonally adjusted WPI increased by 1.4 percent. In this period, the agriculture
sector made the largest contribution to the rise in WPrI. It is observed that the agricultural prices,
which rose by 5.5 percent, are affected by fruit and vegetable prices that increased remarkably due to
seasonal factors. Seasonally adjusted agricultural prices grew by 3.5 percentin September, compared
to the previous month. However, since the beginning of 2004, the seasonally adjusted average

increase has been 0.9 percent.

li. Analyzing in terms of the contribution of the agriculture sector to WPI throughout the year, İt İs
however observed that the rapid rise in September was compensated with the declines during the
summer months. İhus, on an annual basis, the rise in agriculture prices remained below the rise in
WPI excluding agriculture. However, agriculture prices that will seasonally display a rapid rise in the

rest of 2004 are likely to have an unfavorable effect on the WPrI.

12. The biggest contribution to the İ.1 percent- price increase in public manufacturing industry came
from chemicals production and petroleum products manufacturing sectors. Meanwhile, food and
chemicals production stand as the determining factors in the 0.6 percent-price increase in private
manufacturing sector. Energy prices maintained their current trend and rose by 0.3 percent. İt is
observed that the energy prices have displayed a downward trend on an annual basis with a 1İ.3
percent decline. In September, the annual WPI and WPI excluding agriculture rose to i2.5 percent

and 12.7 percent, respectively.

I. OUTLOOK
13. As foreseen in our inflation and outlook reports, the base effect has lost its weight in September
and the downward trend in annual inflation has picked up its course again. Moreover, it has become
clear that the inflation would have remained within the range of targets by the end of 2004 as well
folowing 2002 and 2003. That the cumulative price increases in the first nine months of the year
became only 4.8 percent highlights the fact that the possibility of exceeding the year-end target is

very low even if any exogenous shocks emerge in the rest of the year.

14. In our recent analyses, we had mentioned that the rapid rises in prices of manufacturing industry
posed a risk on consumer inflation, but it was highly likely that the effect of the said cost rises on
consumer prices would most likely remain limited thanks to the rigid fiscal and monetary policies and
the structural transformation in pricing behaviors. In this context, inflatıon figures for September

support our claim that the boost in domestic demand does not exert a marked pressure on İnflation.

15. The reason why no obvious inflationary pressure was observed despite the high growth rates in
recent period should be carefully analyzed. The current economic program coupled with the rigid
monetary and fiscal policies allows a controlled recovery in domestic demand and contributes to the
favorable course of inflation expectations. Besides, the factthatthe economic agents began to foresee
the future more cleariy while making their decisions and the ongoing boost in labor force productivity

led to a rise in private sector investments as well, and the upward movement in potential production
level continued. In 2004, private consumer spending followed the output rise as well; however,

ultimate domestic demand has not reached the level to keep up with the total output yet.

16. Growth figures of the second half of 2004 indicate that the recovery in domestic demand has had
a spillover effect on sectors other than durable goods, especially, unlike the first guarter expenditures
in terms of semi/non-durable goods rapidiy increase. For example, compulsory consumption
expenditures increased by 7.6 percent in the second guarter of 2004. However, the level of real
compulsory consumption expenditures in the second guarter of 2004 is only 2 percent over that ofthe
second guarter of 1998. In fact, as mentioned many times in previous reports, even though the
calculations of output gap point out to the fact that the contributions of general supply-demand
conditions on the declining process of inflation will not be as influential as it was in the past three
years, as of the second guarter of 2004 the dominant view is thatthe level reached at outputlevel will
not cause an evident inflationary pressure. Although it is difficult to determine the current situation
since the GNP figures have not been announced yet, there is no apparent pressure in the third guarter

according to predictions and analyses made.

17. However, considering the prevalence of the increases in private consumption in terms of
expenditure sub-items and rapid increase in expenditures regarding semi/non-durable consumptlon
goods coupled with other services, indicators of domestic demand should be closely monitored. In line
with this, the relative slowdown of rapid increase in the volume of credits and a similar tendency in
money demand are significant developments. Moreover, it is observed that some selective measures
taken towards the second half of the year, following the fluctuation in financial markets, slowed down
the demand for durable goods and automobile. Therefore, as of the last guarter of 2004 the growth
rate is expected to slacken. Nonetheless, it is foreseen that this slowdown will be moderate and high

levels in production will continue parallel to stable foreign demand and consumer confidence.

18. On the other hand, the increase in employmentis predicted to relatively accelerate next year, and
so is the pressure on real wages. In this case, the persistence of high growth in line with the falling
inflaton will be linked to the continuance of productivity increases. Although higher investment
expenditures in the recent period pointto a high probability for the productivity increase and thus the
stability in unit costs to continue next year as well, steps to be taken towards eliminating the obstacles
to investments and production in the medium and long-term, enhancing productüvity in the public

sector and improving the competitive environment bear critical significance.

19. Although emphasized in our previous releases and reports, one basic issue related to inflation and
monetary policy has not been clearly understood yet. The Central Bank, in its price stability-focused
monetary policy strategy in effect for more than three years, has been targeting consumer prices, not
wholesale prices. As a matter of fact, “inflation” is used synonymously with CPI increase in the reports
published; CPI increases are taken into consideration in conducting iİnflation analysis and taking
monetary policy decisions connected with this. Wholesale prices, on the other hand, are referred

entirely on the basis of the forward-looking information they contain as regards CPI.
20. Within this context, what information does the WPI increase in September contain for the future
inflaton? It is observed that the 5.5 percentage-point rise in agricultural prices in September had a
determinant impact on wholesale prices. A similar development is also expected next month due to
irregular seasonalities. However, it should be highlighted that the private manufacturing sector prices,
which is a more economicaliy-meaningful sub-item that provides more hints pertaining to future
inflation, has started to get stabilized following the slowdown both in raw materlal prices and in other
cost increases. The rise in manufacturing industry prices, which started to accelerate due to the global
rise in the prices of goods, decelerated both in public and private sectors in September. Excluding the
unforeseen seasonal volatilities in agricultural prices and public price adjustments, WPI inflation is

expected to follow a steady course in the upcoming period.

21. Undoubtediy, food prices played an important role in the favorable course of inflation in the first
eight months of the year. Whereas food prices mostly depend on seasonal developments and natural
conditions, therefore they provide very litde information for the future inflatıon and can play no
significant role in monetary policy decision-making process. The monetary authorities in the world do
not have an effective instrument against price changes stemming from oil prices and indirect tax
implementations. Moreover, central banks' sudden responses to such exogenous shocks may
adversely affect the social welfare level in the short run. Therefore, mostcentral banks officially aim at
general consumer prices, however, sometimes they resort to another index that excludes energy, food
or public prices and represent medium-term inflation more satisfactorily, and they use this index in
making monetary policy decisions. Currentiy, the Central Bank and the State Institute of Statistics are

Jointly working on a project to develop a “core inflation” series to be used to this end.

22. For a long period of time, Central Bank has been drawing attention to the inflation in 2005 and
focusing on the risks concerning this period. External developments stand as the most important
factors to be followed closely in the upcoming period. Federal Reserve of the USA implied that it
would not adopt an aggressive attitude towards the increase in interests. However, news over the full
EU membership process worse than expected may cause a fluctuatlon in financial markets. Moreover,
as it is emphasized repeatediİy, in case where the three-year national program focuses on structural
reforms and fiscal discipline is maintained, the mentioned fluctuations will be deemed as temporary

deviations from the stability environment.

23. Another risk factor for 2005 inflation is that the price rigidity in services group has not been
entirely broken yet. The difference between the price-increase rates of goods and services groups got
bigger since August 2003. In September 2004, the annual inflation rate, which was about 25 percent
in both groups in August 2003, rolled back to 5.6 percent and 15.3 percent in goods and services
group, respectively. The difference between goods and services prices, which has been observed since
2003, can be explained by several factors: (i) the goods group has a relatively stronger pass-through
from rates to prices compared to services group. (il) Services prices display a backward-looking pricing
behavior. (ili) Goods, which are subjected to foreign trade, display a high rate of produttivity.

However, in a period where general price increases are İn single digits, the 20 percent-increase in
annual rent figures pose a considerable risk to price stability. Since a noticeable deviation of a subitem, which has an iİmportant share in the targeted price index, will bear more significance than İt

does today in the upcoming term, where the goal is maintaining permanent price stability.

24. Another factor that might pose a risk for 2005 inflation is the possibility that the recent raises in
oil and raw metal prices might not reverse in near future and might even continue with further rises.
In the past periods when inflation was very high, effects of the changes in world prices on domestic
inflaton used to remain at ignorable levels. However, it is clear that the fluctuations in raw materlal
import prices will increasingiy gain more importance in the following period where single-digit inflation
will prevalil. The effects of recent rises İn raw material import prices, which showed through to
inflaton directiy or indirectly through input costs, started to be perceived in the second half of the
year. However, there has been no signal of a disruption in inflaton expectations up to this time.

Nevertheless, indirect effects of the rises particulariIy in oil prices will continue to be monitored closely.

25. To conclude, it is believed that currentiy there are no serious risks that could jeopardize the endyear inflation target for 2004. Whereas, some risk factors are projected for 2005, such as: domestic
demand and labor costs might notbe contributing to the downward trend in inflation in 2005 as much
as they did in 2004, high oil prices might pull up energy costs and impose pressure both on current
account and inflation, and liguidity shortages in the international markets coupled with rise in interest
rates might exert pressure on exchange rates. However, what is crucially important for the future
inflaton trend is to maintain budget discipline and the guality of budget discipline, to carry on with the
structural reforms such as the tax and social security reforms that will smooth the way for budget
discipline in the upcoming years, with no interruption. Provided these policies are effectively
implemented, the main course of inflation would be downwards even if there were temporary
fluctuations due to exogenous shocks. Under the assumption that the current economic policies would
continue, the public revenues and budget policy would be carried outin compliance with the targeted
inflaton rate and the structural reforms within the framework of the three-year economic program
would be intensified, it is projected that inflation would follow a course well below the program target
throughout 2004 and downward trend in increase in food, energy and public prices, which are

seasonaliy adjusted, would continue in 2005.
