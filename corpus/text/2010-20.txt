PRESS RELEASE ON THE REVISION OF THE REAL EXCHANGE RATE INDEX 
 
Structural changes in global trade and the resultant formation of global 
production sharing in the last twenty years have significantly transformed the 
structure of international trade in Turkey, in terms of both product variety and country 
groups. The changes in Turkey’s international trade structure necessitate the reel 
effective exchange rate (REER) index to be updated in a way that reflects Turkey’s 
commercial product variety and country diversity. In this respect REER index, which 
is published on the official web site of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey 
(CBRT) (www.tcmb.gov.tr ) under the sub- heading “Data/Statistical Data/Real 
Effective Exchange Rates” and which can also be available as a time series on CBRT’s Electronic Data Delivery System (
http://evds.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/cbt- uk.html ), 
has been revised. Having adopted the methodology that is used by a group of international institutions, the number of countries covered has been broadened and 
their weights have been updated with thes e revisions.  
 Within this context:  
• While the previous index employed trade flow data of 1988- 1990 in the 
computation of  REER weights, the new index employs 2006- 2008 
trade flow data.  
• While the country weights of the previous index were computed using data on 19 countries, the coverage has been broadened to include 36 
countries in the computation of CPI -based index and 31 for the case of 
PPI-based index.  
• In addition to CPI and PPI -based indexes, a Unit Labor Cost -based 
index is produced in the new series, a nd also, CPI based REER index 
is computed separately for each developed and developing country 
groups that are included in the computation of country weights.  • In line with the CPI data disseminated by the Turkish Statistical 
Institute, the new series will  be started as of 2003. Therefore, the mean 
CPI value for 2003 has been taken as the base.
