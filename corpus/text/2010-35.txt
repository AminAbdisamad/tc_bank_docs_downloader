SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: October 14, 2010

Inflation Developments
1. Consumer prices picked up by 1.23 percent in September and annual inflation
rose by 0.91 percentage points to 9.24 percent. The rise in annual inflation
was due to the sharp increase in unprocessed food prices. Inflation was
generally moderate across all other subcategories. While annual services
inflation continued to decrease steadily, core inflation indicators remained in
line with medium-term targets.
2. Annual inflation in food and nonalcoholic beverages increased by 4.96
percentage points to 15.33 percent in September due to continued upswings
in unprocessed food prices. As noted in the September summary of the
Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) meeting, the steep rise in
vegetable prices pushed food and nonalcoholic beverages prices higher.
Moreover, unprocessed meat prices continued to increase in September.
Thus, annual unprocessed food inflation increased by 20.89 percent over two
months, bringing annual inflation in this subgroup to an all-time high of 28.74
percent. Meanwhile, processed food inflation remained subdued despite
higher processed meat prices. However, the recent increase in domestic
wheat prices driven by rising global wheat prices continues to put upward
pressure on processed food prices.
3. Energy prices rose slightly in September, while annual energy inflation
continued to decline. Inflation in core goods and services remained broadly
contained. The annual rate of increase in the prices of services excluding
catering and transport, which are relatively more demand-sensitive, dropped to
an all-time low of 1.85 percent. Similarly, the annual rate of increase in core
goods (goods excluding food, energy, alcoholic beverages, tobacco and gold)
prices continued to fall. Moreover, recent figures on seasonally adjusted
inflation data indicate that underlying inflation remains in line with mediumterm targets. The base effects from the temporary 2009 tax incentives on
durable goods would serve to bring annual inflation down in October.
4. Against this backdrop, the Committee has reiterated that inflation would be on
a declining path in the forthcoming period.

Factors Affecting Inflation
5. Recent data releases suggest that the economy continues to recover.
Industrial production grew by a seasonally adjusted 2.7 percent month-onmonth in August and by 1.0 percent compared to the previous quarter during
July-August. Taking into account the July-August developments as well as the
September and the fourth quarter leading indicators, industrial production
growth is expected to slow in the third quarter, but then accelerate in the fourth
quarter. However, the Committee has noted that, despite posting quarterly
gains since the second quarter of 2009, industrial production is still running
below pre-crisis levels.
6. Domestic demand displays a relatively stronger outlook. Both the July-August
data on the production and imports of consumer goods and the September
survey indicators show that private consumption demand continued to recover
steadily during the third quarter. Moreover, the improvement in consumer
confidence indicates that private consumption demand would remain robust in
the final quarter. In addition, investments are expected to recover further in the
third quarter and grow markedly year-on-year. In fact, indices for the
production and imports of investment goods increased during July-August
compared to the previous quarter, while firms’ investment expectations
continued to improve steadily over these two months and rose sharply in
September. Yet, the Committee has stated that the uncertainty about foreign
demand might dampen investment growth, particularly in the manufacturing
industry.
7. Uncertainty regarding foreign demand remains elevated. After falling in June
and July, the export quantity index excluding gold moved up in August yet
remained below its level in May. According to recent foreign trade data,
exports grew slightly in September and October, with new manufacturing
orders following a similar pattern. Amid weak foreign demand underpinned by
signs of slowing global trade and projections of a slowdown in the pace of the
global recovery, the Committee reiterated that it would take a while before
industrial capacity utilization rates return to pre-crisis levels.
8. Although employment conditions continue to improve, unemployment rates still
remain elevated. Industrial employment continued to recover in June, whereas
services employment dropped slightly in seasonally adjusted terms. Thirdquarter leading indicators suggest that the halt in non-farm employment
growth is temporary and employment would continue to rise gradually.
Nevertheless, the Committee has reiterated that the unemployment rates
would remain higher than pre-crisis levels for some time, containing unit labor
costs.

Risks and Monetary Policy
9. The Committee has assessed the inflation forecasts and the economic outlook
to be presented in the Inflation Report. In line with the developments outlined
above, inflation forecasts were based on an outlook which envisages that
domestic demand is stronger compared to the previous period, external
demand continues to restrain economic activity, and thus aggregate demand
conditions continue to support disinflation, albeit to a lesser degree. Therefore,
it is expected that inflation would be on a declining path in the forthcoming
period, while core inflation would remain consistent with the medium-term
targets.
10. In light of these assessments, the Committee has reiterated that it would be
necessary to maintain policy rates at current levels for some time, and to keep
them at low levels for a long period. On the other hand, in order to enhance
the efficient functioning of the Turkish lira market, the Committee has decided
to reduce the borrowing rates by 50 basis points.
11. Developments regarding global economic activity would continue to be the
main factor driving inflation dynamics and the monetary policy outlook.
Recently, leading indicators of economic activity continue to slow down,
underscoring downside risks especially regarding the US economy.
Furthermore, ongoing problems in credit, real estate, and labor markets across
developed economies and the uncertainties regarding the impact of fiscal
consolidations suggest that the downside risks regarding the pace of global
growth are likely to persist for some time. The Committee stated that, should
the global economy face a longer-than-anticipated period of anemic growth,
the monetary tightening envisaged during the final quarter of 2011 under the
baseline scenario of the October Inflation Report may be postponed.
Moreover, it was indicated that an outcome whereby global economic
problems intensify and contribute to a contraction of domestic economic
activity, may trigger a new easing cycle. By contrast, it was underscored that
monetary tightening may be implemented in an earlier period, should the
recovery in economic activity turn out to be faster than expected.
12. Expectations of more accommodative monetary policies in developed
economies have been leading to a surge in capital flows toward emerging
markets. This development, coupled with the relative improvement in the
creditworthiness of Turkey, exacerbates the risks related to the divergence
between the domestic and external demand. While not yet a significant
concern regarding financial stability, the Committee has indicated that these
developments support the implementation of the “exit strategy” measures.
Therefore, the Committee has indicated that it would be appropriate to
proceed with the remaining measures outlined in the exit strategy that were

envisaged to be implemented by the end of 2010. Moreover, the Committee
has judged that the 3-month repo funding is no longer needed.
13. Should the capital inflows continue, the divergence in the growth rates
between domestic and external demand is likely to intensify in the forthcoming
period. Additional policy instruments, other than the short-term policy rates,
would be needed to curb risks emanating from this channel. In this respect,
the Committee stated that, should the disparity between domestic demand and
external demand continue, it would be necessary to utilize other policy
instruments such as reserve requirement ratios and liquidity management
facilities more effectively, to address financial stability concerns including rapid
credit expansion and a deterioration in the current account balance.
14. Food and commodity price inflation has accelerated recently. The existing
output gap and the strength of the Turkish lira has been limiting the passthrough from food and commodity prices to the prices of core goods and
services. However, potential second-round effects continue to be a risk, if the
increases in food and commodity prices persist. The Committee indicated that,
should such a risk materialize and lead to a deterioration in the price setting
behavior which in turn hampers the attainment of medium-term inflation
targets, an earlier-than-envisaged tightening in the baseline scenario would be
considered.
15. The CBT continues to monitor fiscal policy developments closely while
formulating monetary policy. Increasing government saving under the present
circumstances is essential to control the current account deficit driven by the
disparity between domestic and external demand. The Medium Term Program
(MTP) is seen as an important step toward this direction. Accordingly, our
revised forecasts take the projections of the government expenditures in the
MTP as given, while tax adjustments are assumed to be consistent with the
inflation targets and automatic pricing mechanisms. The Committee stated
that, should the fiscal stance deviate significantly from this framework and
consequently have an adverse effect on inflation outlook, a revision in the
monetary policy stance may be considered.
16. Monetary policy will continue to focus on price stability in the period ahead.
Strengthening the commitment to fiscal discipline and the structural reform
agenda would support the improvement of Turkey’s sovereign risk, and thus
facilitate macroeconomic and price stability. In this respect, timely
implementation of the structural reforms envisaged by the MTP and the
European Union accession process remains to be of utmost importance.
