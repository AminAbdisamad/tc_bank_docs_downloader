As stipulated in the Article 42 of the Central Bank Law, in the case of a significant 
breach of the inflation target, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (the Central Bank) is 
required to report to the Government and announce to the public the reasons behind the breach 
of the target and the necessary measures to be taken. As stated in the main policy document 
titled “Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy in 2013”, which was published on Decembe r 25, 
2012; the inflation target for 2013 was set jointly with the Government as 5 percent. In the 
same document, it was also indicated that the Central Bank would write an open letter to the 
Government should end -year inflation exceed the target significa ntly (by more than 2 
percentage points in either direction). Inflation reached 7.40 percent at end -2013, notably 
exceeding the target. This text elaborates on the reasons why the target was missed and explains 
the measures taken —and to be taken —to bring inflation back to the target.  
Factors  Affecting Inflation in 2013  
In the first  Inflation  Report  of 2013 (IR 2013/I), the mid -point of  inflation  forecast for 
the year -end was given  as 5.3 percent . However , deviations from th is projection  across the year  
caused  inflation  to remain above the uncertainty band at the year -end.   
The main factor causing inflation to exceed the target significantly in 201 3 is the 
increases in the exchange rate in the second half of the year. The depreciation of the Turkish 
lira amid the movements in the currencies of emerging economies due to the global 
uncertainties regarding monetary policies had an impact on the core  inflation particularly 
through core goods prices . Despite the relatively mild course of import prices in 2013 , the 
effect of exchange rate  developments on inflation  reached 1.5 percentage points by the year 
end.  TÜRKİYE CUMHURİYET MERKEZ BANKASI A.Ş

 Another factor causing i nflation  to remain above the projected level is the course of 
food prices . The annual  food inflation , which was assumed as 7 percent at the start of the year, 
climbed to 9.7 percent at the end of the year . This was mainly attributed to  hikes in unprocessed 
food prices , which caused inflation to deviate  from the target by  0.6 percentage points. The net 
effect of administered pric es on  inflation  proved consistent with the forecasts presented in the 
Inflation  Report  of January 2013 . 
As a result , inflation  exceeded the target due to the  developments in the exchange rate  
and food prices .  
 
Measures Taken to Attain the Inflation Target  
Main determinants of i nflation  dynami cs are  demand  and cost factors besides  inflation  
expectations . Analysis of these factors suggest s that the mild course of economic activity in 
2013 has prevented the occurrence of demand -driven  pressures on inflation . The rise in 
inflation  in the second half of the year was mainly caused by  the cost-side effect of the 
exchange rate  developments stemming from external uncertainties besides the  high course of 
unprocessed food prices  that is beyond the control  of the monetary policy .  
Uncertainties regarding global monetary policies have grown since May 2013, which 
caused portfolio flow towards emerging economies to lose pace and financial assets to be re -
priced in the second half of the year. In the same period, forei gn financing extended to the real 
sector and the banking sector in Turkey continued, while portfolio flows remained weak.  Re-
pricing of financial assets led the Turkish lira to depreciate.  The mild growth in domestic 
demand and the uptrend in credits conti nued in this period (Chart  1). Elevated external 
uncertainties mainly influenced exchange rates rather than loan s (Chart  2).

Exchange rate developments coupled with the high course of food prices in the second 
half of 2013 led the year -end inflation to considerably exceed the target.  These developments 
deteriorated inflation expectations as well. To contain the risks to inflation and achieve 
convergence of the medium -term inflation outlook and the target, the Central Bank enhanced 
the cautious monetary stance and ensured the interbank market rates to increase more than 300 
basis points following May  (Chart  3). Moreover, the composition of the provided liquidity was 
adjusted to have a shorter maturity and mostly as overnight funding, which resulted in a tighte r 
liquidity policy.

 To contain the upside risks to i nflation  and enhance  financial  stability, slowing 
especially the growth rate of consumer loans is critical as well . This will contribute to the 
balanced maintenance of the domestic -foreign demand composition in the mild growth process, 
thereby limiting the demand -driven inflation ist pressures . Tightening in the liquidity policy  
implemented by the Central Bank in the second half of the year will enhance this process . 
Moreover, it is also expected that net foreign exchange sales will support the eff ectiveness  of 
the liquidity policy by increasing the liquidity need  of the financial  system, resulting in an 
additional slowing effect on consumer loans (Table  1).

The macroprudential measures taken recently by the Banking Regulation and 
Supervision Agency  (BRSA)  are expected to curb consumer loans . The effects of 
macroprudential measures, such as increasing general provision ratios for consumer loans, 
raising minimum payments on  credit cards, restricting credit card limits based on income 
levels , reducing the number of instalments on credit cards and applying loan -to-value 
restrictions  for auto loans, on consumer loans will become more evident by February . These 
developments will  allow for a more balanced domestic demand growth , which will both  
constrain demand -side inflationary pressures and support the correction in the current account 
deficit . 
The Central Bank will maintain its cautious monetary stance until the  inflation outlo ok 
is consistent with medium -term targets . As the liquidity policy becomes tighter, capital flows 
remain weak and macroprudential measures become effective, the contribution of domestic 
demand will be more balanced and the pressures on inflation will be co ntained . The recent 
depreciation of the Turkish lira may cause inflation to remain elevated during the first few 
months . Yet, under the outlook that the recent increase in domestic uncertainty is temporary, TÜRKİYE CUMHURİYET MERKEZ BANKASI A.Ş

 the delayed effects of the exchange rate  on infla tion are expected to weaken by mid -2014  and 
inflation  is projected to return to a gradual downward path by the second half of the year . 
Although the monetary policy does not respond to primary effects, it monitors the effects of 
temporary inflation  movemen ts on the pricing behavior . Moreover , it is highly important that 
the monetary policy in effect does not lead to un want ed fluctuations in economic activity and 
have adverse effects on financial stability . Therefore , the decline in inflation is expected to be a 
gradual one and reach the target over a one -and-a-half-year horizon .  
Against this background , inflation  is expected to reach the 5-percent target in mid -2015 
(Chart 4). Inflation  may remain volatile in the first half of the year due to tax adjustment s, the 
effects of increased exchange rates and energy prices , but decline rapidly by mid -2014 to stay 
within the uncertainty band at year -end once the temporary factors fade . The risks to the 
inflation outlook are analyzed in the  January 2014 Inflation Rep ort.

 Conclusion  
Inflation  exceeded the target significantly at the end of 2013 , which was caused by the 
depreciation of the Turkish lira besides  food prices . The Central Bank has responded to the 
increase in inflation by an enhanced cautious stance and tightening in liquidity policy. 
Accordingly, inflation is expected to move towards the target gradually  by the second half of 
the year . The Central Bank will continue to monitor developments influencing the inflation 
outlook and take the necessary measures to retain the achievements on price stability. The 
Inflation Report, published today on our website, w hich presents the developments regarding 
inflation and moneta ry policy as well as our medium -term forecasts, is enclosed for your 
information.
