SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: April 13, 2010

Inflation Developments
1. Consumer prices increased by 0.58 percent in March. Annual inflation was
down 0.57 percentage points yielding a rate of 9.56 percent. The decline in
annual inflation was largely driven by the correction in vegetable prices, as
envisaged in the Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee)
Meeting held in March.
2. Developments in energy and food prices lead to fluctuations in inflation. After a
sharp increase in February driven by adverse weather conditions, vegetable
prices displayed a partial correction in March. On the other hand, meat prices
continued to rise, albeit at a slower pace, and remained the main driver of
higher food prices. In fact, the cumulative price hike for unprocessed and
processed meat products amounted to 9.85 and 8.86 percent, respectively,
during the first quarter. Meanwhile, annual energy inflation continued to rise in
March to 10.26 percent on the back of the low base effect from 2009 as well
as higher fuel and water prices. Therefore, food and energy items account for
4.62 percentage points of annual inflation as of the end of the first quarter.
Food and energy prices are expected to remain volatile over the upcoming
period.
3. Core inflation indicators rose markedly in March. The year-on-year increase in
core goods prices (goods excluding food, energy, alcoholic beverages,
tobacco and gold) was largely attributable to the base effect resulting from the
tax cuts on durable goods in 2009, and partly to developments in clothing
prices. On the other hand, inflation in other goods continued on a downtrend.
4. Similarly, the annual rate of change in prices of services increased significantly
in March. While higher energy prices put further pressure on transport
services, rising meat prices continued to weigh on catering services.
Moreover, landline call rates soared, accounting for about one-fourth of the
increase in annual core inflation measured by the H index.
5. The Committee expects that core inflation indicators would increase in April as
well, owing to the temporary tax cuts of the previous year, but would continue
to remain at levels below the target.

Factors Affecting Inflation
6. Recent data releases suggest that the recovery in economic activity is
ongoing. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded by 6.0 percent year-onyear during the fourth quarter of 2009, and by 2.3 percent quarter-on-quarter
in seasonally adjusted terms, indicating that economic activity has continued
to recover, albeit more modestly.
7. On the spending side, public consumption grew rapidly to bolster quarterly
GDP growth, whereas private demand remained more moderate. The run-up
in public spending on goods and services was due to advance payment of the
health care expenditures for 2010 amid the improved budget revenue
performance. In this respect, the Committee emphasized that the marked
increase in public spending is largely transitory.
8. First-quarter data suggest that economic activity continued to recover in 2010.
In February, the seasonally adjusted industrial production index increased by
1.6 percent month-on-month. Industrial production is expected to grow at a
slightly faster pace during March. The Committee noted that industrial
production grew by 17.2 percent year-on-year during January-February in
calendar adjusted terms, and emphasized that annual growth would reach
double digits in the first quarter owing to the low base effect from a year
earlier. Nevertheless, the Committee reiterated that growth rates in seasonally
adjusted terms are more informative for assessing the underlying trend in
economic activity.
9. Domestic demand is following a gradual growth trend. The effects of the policy
rate cuts and increased public spending are having a more noticeable effect
on domestic demand, with sectors more sensitive to domestic demand
experiencing relatively stronger growth performances. The recent pick-up in
industrial production indicates that sectors with strong linkages to non-durable
goods manufacturing and construction have been on the rebound. Commercial
loan and employment data verify that the recovery is more pronounced in the
services sector, which is more sensitive to domestic demand, compared to the
industrial sector.
10. Both the increase in labor compensation driven by employment growth and the
favorable developments across credit markets are supporting the recovery in
private consumption. Production and imports data indicate that private
consumption demand continued to rise moderately during the first quarter. The
PMI new order index suggests that the recovery continued into the first
quarter, albeit at a slower pace, which is also confirmed by the consumer
confidence indices.

11. Production and imports data for capital goods suggest that the recovery in
private investment demand has yet to gain momentum. The global growth
outlook continues to dampen economic activity, particularly in sectors that are
relatively more sensitive to foreign demand, such as export-oriented industrial
sectors and related services sectors. Following the recent crisis,
manufacturing firms that mostly serve external markets are operating at lower
capacity than local market-oriented firms. Accordingly, indicators of resource
utilization, such as capacity utilization in the manufacturing industry and hours
worked per capita, remain weak. Investment demand is expected to continue
to grow moderately in the upcoming period. Yet, given the weak global growth
outlook, insufficient and uncertain aggregate demand is likely to restrain new
investments in the manufacturing industry. Therefore, the Committee expects
investment demand to remain below pre-crisis levels for a while.
12. Uncertainty regarding foreign demand remains. The export quantity index was
down 8.6 percent year-on-year during January-February; yet, excluding gold,
the index remained flat quarter-on-quarter. The Committee emphasized that
the growth outlook for export markets, particularly the euro area, remains
weak, and reiterated that the recovery in exports would be gradual, which is
also confirmed by the recent trends in leading indicators for exports. Thus, it
would take a while before industrial capacity utilization rates return to pre-crisis
levels.
13. Although employment conditions continue to improve, unemployment rates still
remain at high levels. Seasonally adjusted data indicate that non-farm
employment continues to recover. Weak foreign demand continued to restrain
industrial employment, while non-farm employment returned to pre-crisis
levels owing to the recovery in construction and services sectors.
Nevertheless, the Committee expects unemployment to remain well above
pre-crisis levels for a long period, and therefore unit labor costs are not
expected to face any significant upside pressures.

Risks and Monetary Policy
14. In light of above assessments, the Committee has indicated that the economic
recovery is ongoing. The lagged effects of monetary easing on domestic
demand have become more pronounced, while the weak outlook for global
growth has continued to dampen resource utilization in the tradable sector. On
balance, the Committee continues to expect the economic recovery to be
gradual.
15. The Committee indicated that inflation would hover significantly above the
target for sometime owing to the base effects driven by the temporary tax cuts

and volatile unprocessed food prices during 2009. Temporary tax cuts
implemented in March 2009, which were withdrawn partly in June and fully in
October, would lead to an increase in headline and core inflation rates during
March and April, and a decrease during June, July and October of 2010.
16. Inflation is expected to drop significantly in the last quarter of 2010 and the first
quarter of 2011. The fall in the last quarter of 2010 reflects the base effect
driven by the indirect tax hikes and the sharp increase in food prices in the last
quarter of 2009. Similarly, the impact of the tax hikes, which added around 1.9
percentage points to headline inflation in the first two months of 2010, would
disappear during the first quarter of 2011. Accordingly, the Committee stated
that inflation would revert back to a downward trend as the temporary factors
taper off starting in the last quarter of the year, and converge to levels
consistent with the targets by early 2011.
17. The Committee has underscored that elevated levels of inflation, albeit
temporary, warrants close monitoring of price setting behavior. Several
adverse factors (such as unprocessed food and oil price increases, base
effects and administered price hikes) have led to a significant increase in
inflation since the last quarter of 2009. Although these factors are temporary,
they cause headline inflation to stay at elevated levels for sometime, leading to
an adverse impact on inflation expectations. Currently the pricing behavior,
excluding items that are directly affected by cost push effects, does not reveal
a deterioration that might endanger the achievement of medium term targets.
However, the Committee underscored that the CBT will not hesitate to take the
necessary measures, should inflation expectations continue to rise and lead to
a deterioration in general price setting behavior.
18. Although downside risks on global economic activity have been decreasing,
they have not disappeared completely. Rising budget deficits and ongoing
problems in credit, real estate and labor markets across developed economies
continue to pose downside risks for the recovery in global activity. The
Committee stated that, should the global conditions deteriorate again, and
consequently delay the domestic recovery, the policy rates would be kept
constant for an extended period.
19. The Committee indicated that uncertainties regarding the lagged effects of the
strong monetary stimulus have been leading to upside risks on both domestic
and global economic activity. According to the Committee members, the
recovery in domestic demand has been relatively robust. Therefore, a fasterthan-envisaged recovery in external demand would lead to a rapid narrowing
in the resource utilization gap, which, coupled with cost push pressures, could
delay the attainment of medium term inflation targets. In this respect, it was
stated that necessary measures would be taken to ensure the alignment of

medium term inflation with the targets, should the recovery in economic
activity turn out to be faster than expected.
20. Prospects regarding the pace of growth in developing economies, especially in
China and India, have been posing upside risks regarding commodity prices.
Increasing share of these economies in total world demand has been creating
additional pressures on commodity prices. If commodity prices rise faster than
expected in the forthcoming period and delay the disinflation, then the
Committee will implement the policies required to eliminate the risks related to
price setting behavior.
21. The Committee will continue to monitor fiscal policy developments closely
while formulating monetary policy. Since the second half of 2009, economic
activity has been stronger than envisaged in the Medium Term Program
(MTP), leading to a better than expected performance in budget revenues.
Using this fiscal space mostly to reduce the government debt, as implied by
the fiscal rule, would facilitate the demand management and ease the need for
indirect tax hikes, therefore providing more room to conduct countercyclical
monetary policy. In this respect, the Committee believes that, should the goals
set out in the Medium Term Program be implemented through institutional and
structural progress, such as enacting and establishing the fiscal rule, it would
be possible to keep policy rates at single digit levels over the medium term.
22. In light of these assessments, and considering the normalization in the money
and credit markets, the Committee has decided to gradually remove the
liquidity measures implemented during the crisis. In this context, the
Committee members fully agreed that publishing a comprehensive technical
note regarding the exit strategy, the day after the meeting, would enhance
predictability of the monetary policy. However, despite recent improvements,
lingering problems across the global economy are not resolved completely.
Accordingly, the Committee has stated that it may be necessary to maintain
policy rates at current levels for sometime, and to keep them at low levels for a
long period.
23. Since the last quarter of 2008, the CBT, without prejudice to its primary
objective of price stability, has focused on containing the adverse effects of the
global crisis on the domestic economyâ€”which has been achieved to a large
extent. Monetary policy will continue to focus on price stability in the period
ahead. Strengthening the commitment to fiscal discipline and the structural
reform agenda would support the improvement of Turkeyâ€™s sovereign risk, and
thus facilitate macroeconomic and price stability. In this respect, timely
implementation of the structural reforms envisaged by the Medium Term
Program and the European Union accession process remains to be of utmost
importance.
