April Inflation and Outlook
I. GENERAL EVALUATTON

1. The downward trend in consumer inflation rates continued in April 2004 as well and annual
inflation rate dropped to 10.2 percent in CPI. A relative acceleration was observed in WPI due to the

effect of agriculture prices and annual inflation became 8.9 percent in WPrI.

2. Seasonalliy adjusted monthliy price increases realized as 1.7 percent and 0.2 percent in WPI and
CPI, respectively. Inflation rates of CPI excluding food and WPI excluding agriculture displayed a

slowdown compared to March and became 0.6 and İ.1İ, respectively.

3. The six-month average of seasonally adjusted inflatıon became 1.2 percent in WPI and 0.6
percent in CPI. Annualized figures correspond to 15.6 percent and 7.6 percent, respectively. During
the same period, the average rate of increase İn seasonally adjusted CPI excluding food realized as

0.8 percent. This figure corresponds to 10.3 percent in annual terms (Figure i).

Developments in Consumer Prices

4. The most significant development in terms of sub-items was noted in prices of durable goods
group. Especially the decline by 7.9 percent in prices of household electrical-non-electrical devices
compared to the previous month is remarkable. Delayed effects of exchange rate along with the sales
campaigns are deemed to have contributed to the downward trend in prices of this group. However, İt
is anticipated that the depreciation of Turkish Lira in the last two weeks of April may exert pressure on

the prices in this group.

5. Price increases in clothing group were limited by 4.8 percent in April as of which the summer
season has opened. This limited rate of increase is considered to be a favorable development.
Clothing prices display high rates of increases twice a year with the opening of new seasons iİn April
and October. However, the prices dropped by 5.7 percent in April 2004 compared to the beginning of

the previous season (October 2003).

6. As for the general trend in services group, seasonally adjusted inflation maintained its general
level of 2004 by 1.2 percent rate of increase. Despite the relative slowdown in rent increases observed
in the last two months, no significant breakdown was recorded in the rigidity in services group prices.
Services group price increase was 4.6 percent in the first four months of the year, while price increase
in goods group was limited by 1.8 percent. Annual rate of price increase as of April is 5.9 percent in

goods group and i8.8 percent in services group.
7. Along with the limited rate of increase observed in clothing prices despite high seasonality in April
as well as the decline in durable goods prices, price increases in all other CPI sub-groups maintained
their downward trend as well. Price increases in all the food-beverages-tobacco, housing, health,

transportation and various goods and services groups realized between the range of 0-0.5 percent.

8. Thus, seasonally adjusted CPI inflatıon became 0.2 percent in April, realizing even below the
average inflation rate of 0.5 percent recorded in the first guarter of 2004. The 0.4 percent monthly

average inflation for the first 4 months of the year corresponds to 4.9 percent in annual terms.

Developments in Wholesale Prices

9. In April 2004, WPI increased by 2.6 percent. The rate of increase in seasonally adjusted WPI rose
by 0.2 point compared to March and became İ./ percent. On the other hand, WPrI inflation excluding

agriculture declined by 0.5 point compared to March and realized as İ.1 percent (Figure 4).

10. The largest contribution to WPI increase was made by the food prices (1.6 point) with a rise of
6.9 percent. Additionally, manufacturing industry prices contributed by 0.9 point to April WPI inflation
with an increase of İ.1 percent. The increase in agriculture prices resulted partly from the recent
inclusion of summer vegetables and fruits within the scope of WPI. Besides, seasonally adjusted rate

of increase in agriculture prices rose by 2.8 points compared to March and realized as 4.5 percent.

11. The decline in the rate of increase in monthly WPI excluding agriculture stemmed mainly from
public manufacturing industry sector. In March, prices in tobacco products manufacturing sector rose
with the tax increases imposed on tobacco products within the framework of supplementary budget
measures, while prices in olil products manufacturing industry cliimbed due to the rise in raw materlal
prices. However, prices in these groups increased at low rates with the removal of above-mentioned
effects in April. On the other hand, basic metal industry prices, which had increased in line with the
upsurge in international raw material prices in January-March period, continued to rise in April as well.

Public basic metal industry prices rose by 3.6 percent in April compared to March.

12. The rate of increase in private manufacturing industry prices rose by 0.8 point from March and
realized as 1.5 percent. Basic metal industry sector, which was negatively affected by raw materilal
prices like public manufacturing industry, has contributed to this development. The rate of increase in
private basic metal industry sector rose by 8 points compared to March and realized as 9.7 percent. As
it is known, the recent prices of raw materials used in basic metal industry were affected by the
pressure on the markets caused by the high rate of growth in China. However, this effect has started
to weaken recentiy. Furthermore, the aforementioned pressure is likely to maintain its weakening
trend in the medium term due to the policies implemented in China to cool the economy as well as the

structural transformation of Chinese economy.

13. As of April, electricity-water-gas prices declined by 1i.6 percent in monthly terms and by 1.8
percent on an annual basis. Increase observed in exchange rates in April will unlikely be reflected on

electricity and natural gas prices.

14. In line with the developments mentioned above, annual WPI inflation and WPI inflation

excluding agriculture rose to 8.9 percent and 6.2 percent, respetctively.

İT, OUTLOOK

General Macroeconomic Outlook

15. Attributing the favorable developments observed in Turkish economy in recent years merely to
external factors means overlooking some basic facts. Important steps were taken towards achieving
stability in the last period. While macroeconomic indicators improved rapidiy, significant changes were
made in institutional structure compared to the previous periods. It is clear that the recovery in the
general trend of the economy will continue as long as the same approach is maintained. We should
remember that the external shocks and uncertainties arising from Iragi operation in the first months
of 2003, which were much greater, had only limited effects on the economy. Hence, the downward
trend in inflation and the recovery process in economic activities continued in the period following the
removal of these unfavorable factors. It should also be kept in mind that the general trend dominated
following the volatility in exchange rate in October 2003 similar to the volatility observed in recent

weeks and the downward trend in inflation as well as growth in the economy continued.

16. The signals given by the Federal Reserve Bank of the USA for a likely rise in interest rates in the
coming months lead to changes in global liguidity and risk trends, thus increasing the fluctuations in
the financial markets of developing countries despite the fact that there is not an obvious change in
basic economic indicators. Turkish economy is affected by a similar trend too, despite the relatively
strong course of basic economic indicators in recent years and some periodic uncertainties on foreign

policy, and the concurrence of these developments and the increase İn current account deficit
reinforces this effect. However, the point that should be underlined here is that the unfavorable
impact of recent developments are bound to be temporary under the assumption that the current
program will be carried out without any compromise. Especially the social security and tax reforms

that would ensure a sustainable fiscal discipline must be realized rapidiy and determinediy.

17. The last three years of experlience under the floating exchange rate regime highlighted the
importance of expectatlons management and future-looking perceptions of economic agents with
respect to macroeconomic balances. The most significant lesson to be derived from these
developments is that not only nominal anchors but also concrete, transparent and accountable
programs are reguired in order to achieve stability and to shape future-looking perceptions. In other
words, the most important economic anchor perceived by public is highly credible stipulation with
concrete arrangements and reforms which would sustain the discipline in economic policies and

reduce the fragility in general economic policies, rather than monetary or fiscal variables.

18. Current program has made great contributions to the fight against inflation and to the structural
reform efforts. Nevertheless, it is clear that these efforts are not adeguate. Economic balances have
not been established permanentily and price stability has not been completely achieved yet. While
entering into a period where uncertainties about external factors are increasing, it is of critical
importance that strong signals should be given for the continuation of current program, which has
proved to be successful in many fronts so far. In other words, the perception of commitments made
for the achievement of minimum fragility in the fundamentals of the economy as credible is now much
more important than ever. Therefore, the willpower on the continuation of the economic program,
which ends in early-2005, will contribute to the achievement of permanent macroeconomic stability in
the medium term, while it will be contributing to reduce the fragility in the short term. It should be
kept in mind that achieving a sustained and high growth as well as price stability depends on the
enforcement of structural transformation process in the medium term and the perception of the
commitments made for this transformation process as credible by economic agencies in the short
term. Thus, the need for a program focused on structural reforms starting from the next year, which
involves structural criteria within the framework of a general and medium-term plan and aims at

continuing its achievements, is the most significant fact that should be underlined.

19. Current account deficit started to expand due to the upsurge in imports, which gained momentum
owing to the recovery initiated in economic activities in the last period. However, in an economy
where fiscal policy is on track, the current account deficit is not expected to display long-term
deviations from general tendency. Hence, İit is predicted that it should start to shrink in the coming
months even though current account deficit is predicted to realize at a high level in the first four
months of the year. Despite the three-year experience in the floating exchange rate regime, İit is
observed that some dynamics with respect to current regime, current account deficit and exchange
rates are still not fulily comprehended. In the course of the implementation of fixed/managed

exchange rate system in the past, a rapid increase in current account deficit was the source of serious
concerns, because an İncreasing current account deficit in economies based on exchange rate anchor,
by which the exchange rate is pre-announced, would undermine the committed exchange rate levels
after a while. This mechanism is still fresh in minds in our country, where an exchange rate policy,
based on level of exchange rates, was implemented for years. Undoubtediy, in a world where capital
movements are considerabiy free and intense, the relationship between exchange rate and current
account deficit may be broken off from time to time. However, since the exchange rate reacts against
an information set involving all forward-looking information under current exchange rate regime,
perceptions for future current account deficits ultimately affect exchange rates and exchange rate
gives both lower wavelength and higher freguency-reactions. Hence, these movements are deemed

“natural” in floating exchange regime.

20. At this point, the importance of risk management of financial and real sectors in the environment
of floating exchange rate regime and declining inflatton once more manifests itself. In the banking
sector, whose financial structure was strengthened via the restructuring program, banks' interest
margins narrowed and their yields arising from the drops in interest rate and exchange rate reduced
due to the significant decline in inflation. In this period, it is essential that banks attribute high

importance to growth for the sake of better harmonization to the declining inflation environment.

Inflation

21. The increase in CPI pursued its favorable course in April as in the previous months and remained
cumulatively at 2.8 percent in the first four months of the year. The decline in inflation resulted
especially from the positive course of expectations and the appreciation of TL in the first guarter of
the year. The partial recovery of domestic demand limited the impact of agriculture prices on food

ongoing positive course of unit labor costs continued to keep the inflation under control.

22. It was repeatedly emphasized since the beginning of 2004 that though annual CPI inflation figures
would decline until May and might display an upward trend as of May, this development would
completely be in line with the inflation target. It should be once more underlined that the right
perception of the significance of the projected course of 12-month cumulative inflation figures in
terms of the formation of expectations in the coming months is of vital importance. In the first 5
months of 2003, inflation rates climbed because of price hikes in food and agricultural products arising
from cost-push factors caused by Irag War as well as adverse weather conditions. With the removal of
the said conditions, CPI inflation pursued a rather modest trend for the rest of the year. These
developments led to an obvious discrepancy in inflation trend between the first and second halves of
2003. As a natural outcome of this effect, the downward trend in annual inflation continued evidentiy
in the first four months of 2004. On the other hand, even though annual inflation rates may display

stagnation or rise due to the reverse of this effect or a likely increase in cost pressure in the second
half the year, such a development will be temporary and be consistent with the inflation target in view

of current data.

23. Undoubtediy, the recent exchange rate movements will have effects on prices via the prices of
imported goods and production costs. However, these effects are predicted to be limited compared to
the past. In fact, with adoption of the floating exchange rate regime, the policy of making exchange
rates artificially predictable has been abandoned and both upward and downward short-term
movements have been observed in the exchange rates, therefore, foreign exchange-denominated
financial instruments are no more secure iİnvestment instruments and the habit of indexation of prices
to exchange rates have changed. Within this context, floating exchange rate regime policy is believed
to have caused a structural change in the pass-through between exchange rate and inflation.
Furthermore, the Central Bank's policy focusing on future course of inflation, a more competitive
environment, decline in inflation and tight fiscal policies that have been implemented for the last two
years are changing pricing behaviors, affecting expectations and contributing to the weakening of the
pass-through from exchange rates to inflation. In fact, the empirical studies show that past inflation is
still an important parameter for inflation expectations; however, the effect of the inflation target on
expectations has increased significantiy in the last period. These studies also indicate that the effect of
exchange rates on inflation started to diminish compared to previous terms. In this context, according
to the figures pertaining to the first four months of the year, the inflation is expected to display
temporary rises İn the upcoming period, however, it is predicted that such a rise would not reach a
level that would jeopardize the inflation target. Moreover, the margin created as the course of
consumer prices iİnflation in the first four months of the year remained even below the course
consistent with the inflation target, indicates that the temporary deviations from the main tendency

would not threaten the end-year target.

24. The factors that might affect the inflation dynamics in the upcoming period are as follows:

— As of March, the ratio of capacity utilization has reached historic highs with 82.3 percent,
which indicates that unless new investments continue, the supply-demand balance will
not support the decline in inflation as much as it did in 2003. However, it is projected that
no significant domestic demand pressure would be observed in 2004 as long as the tight

fiscal policy and the incomes policy consistent with the target are carried out.

u İThe increase in metal iİndustry prices, which put pressure on public and private
manufacturing industry prices in March and April, respectively, would slow down parallel

to the decline in prices around the world as of the upcoming months.

— Exchange rate movements would increase the input costs of imported intermediate goods

and affect inflation directly via imported consumption goods as well. However, this effect
would remain rather weak compared to the pre-2001 period due to the reasons

mentlioned above.

— İThe budget-financing reguirement, which may increase due to the sustained increase in
world oil prices and exchange rate pressure, would make increase in the prices of
petroleum and oil products inevitable. Moreover, as the exchange rate movements that
emerged lately would probably not be reflected to electricity prices, the general cost of

energy would continue to be kept under control.

. İt İs predicted that unit labor costs would continue to contribute positively to inflation
throughout 2004 as a result of the increase in productivity in manufacturing industry;
however, this contribution would not reach a level observed in the last two years.
Nevertheless, taking the necessary measures for enhancing investment and production is

a pre-reguisite for sustained increase in productivity.

. As a by-product of the increasing credibility of economic policies, the end-year inflation

expectations are predicted to remain in the targeted track in the upcoming months.

a— The rigidity in services sector inflation continues relatively and therefore, the possibility of
the offsetting effect of the prices of goods to disappear (due to the cost pressure) in the

upcoming months, is considered as a risk for the general CPI index.

In conclusion, it is predicted that, with the tight monetary and fiscal policies, the relative
advantages provided by the unit labor costs would continue to support İnflation; inflation
might display a periodic rise due to the uncertainty in the exchange rate-inflatlon passthrough, however, the latest developments would remain as mere temporary deviations from
the baseline trend and the end-year inflation target is perceived to be still within reach.
Undoubtediy, it should be noted that these predictions are made under the assumption that
there would be no deviations from the fiscal discipline, the steadfast implementation of the

current program would continue and the structural reforms would not be interrupted.
