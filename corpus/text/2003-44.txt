PRESS RELEASE 
ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE INTERVENTION   
OF THE CENTRAL BANK 
The Central Bank has directly intervened in the for eign exchange market today 
by buying foreign currency  in order to prevent excessive volatility in exchang e 
rates. As in all other interventions in both direct ions, also this intervention has nothing 
to do with any concern about the actual level of ex change rates.  
The Central Bank has announced through several pres s releases that, under 
the floating exchange rate regime, the level of exc hange rate is determined by supply 
and demand conditions in the markets, and that the Central Bank closely monitors 
the volatility in the exchange rate, and may direct ly intervene in the markets in the 
event of an excessive volatility in both directions .
