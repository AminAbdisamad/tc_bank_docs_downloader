Monetary Policy Committee Decision of 19 November 2020, the operational framework of the
liquidity management was changed to provide all short-term funding through the policy rate, and
the monetary policy was tightened through an increase in the policy rate in line with the main
objective of price stability.

effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism. Accordingly, it has been decided;
