Article 45 of the Central Bank Law, firms can obtai n export rediscount credits from

presenting foreign exchange bills for rediscount.  
 
Export rediscount credits are extended to firms thr ough intermediary banks in Turkish 
lira equivalent of the foreign currency amount spec ified in the bill, which is calculated 
based on the exchange rate effective on the day tha t the credit is extended. As the

shorter. Accordingly, their contribution to reserve s varies depending on these 
maturities.
