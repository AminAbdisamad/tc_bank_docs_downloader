Press Release on the Collateral Requirements
As stated in the paragraph 20 of the Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2016
document published on December 9th 2015, “The increase in the ratio of the FX
collateral that can be pledged by banks within the CBRT against their borrowings from
the CBRT Interbank Money Market is expected to boost the demand for FXdenominated bonds issued abroad by the Treasury. This arrangement is expected to
play a stabilizing role against the stress likely to be experienced in credit risk pricing
due to global factors.”
Accordingly, the maximum ratio of 50 percent that banks are able to pledge as FX
denominated collateral against their borrowings at the CBRT Interbank Money
Market are raised to 70 percent as of 13 January 2016.
This ratio will be calibrated further, when deemed necessary, based on future
developments in the global market conditions.
