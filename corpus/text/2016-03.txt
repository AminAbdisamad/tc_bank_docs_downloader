PRESS RELEASE  
10 January 2016 
Press Release on the Collateral Requirements  
As stated in the paragraph 20 of the Monetary and E xchange Rate Policy for 2016 
document published on December 9th 2015, “The increase in the ratio of the FX 
collateral that can be pledged by banks within the C BRT against their borrowings from 
the CBRT Interbank Money Market is expected to boost the demand for FX-
denominated bonds issued abroad by the Treasury. This arrangement is expected to 
play a stabilizing role against the stress likely to be experienced in credit risk pricing 
due to global factors.”   
Accordingly, the maximum ratio of 50 percent that b anks are able to pledge as FX 
denominated collateral against their borrowings at the CBRT Interbank Money 
Market are raised to 70 percent as of 13 January 20 16.  
This ratio will be calibrated further, when deemed necessary, based on future 
developments in the global market conditions.
