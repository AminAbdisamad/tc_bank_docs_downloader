CONFERENCE ON
“RESERVE REQUIREMENTS & OTHER MACROPRUDENTIAL POLICIES:
EXPERIENCES IN EMERGING ECONOMIES”
8-9 OCTOBER 2012, İSTANBUL

PRESS RELEASE
The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey is organizing an International Conference
on “Reserve Requirements & Other Macroprudential Policies: Experiences in Emerging
Economies” on October 8-9, 2012 in Istanbul. The Conference aims to bring together
senior central bankers, economists from international institutions and academics and
provide them with a platform to share recent empirical and theoretical studies on reserve
requirements and other macroprudential policies. The main objective of the Conference
is to give a perspective on the use of macroprudential policies such as reserve
requirements and provide an insight into the experience of emerging economies
regarding the use of such policies as well as the challenges faced by central banks in
the aftermath of the global financial crisis.

The Conference will focus on two central themes. The first of these is how reserve
requirements and other macroprudential tools have been used to mitigate the financial
risk emanating from various sources such as surges in capital flows, rapid credit growth
and fluctuations in asset and commodity prices. In this context, the Conference will also
address how the monetary transmission mechanism works in a setup where
macroprudential policy instruments, such as reserve or liquidity requirements, are used.
The Conference will also attempt to shed light on the effectiveness of these
macroprudential policy instruments on enhancing financial stability in emerging
economies. The second theme of the Conference is to address the operational
framework necessary to incorporate macroprudential tools into the financial stability
framework and to exchange country experiences.

The Conference is expected to host approximately 150 participants. Participation is by
invitation only. The conference language will be English, and a simultaneous translation
service will be provided. The Conference will be open to the press, and television
broadcasting will only be allowed during the opening remarks.
