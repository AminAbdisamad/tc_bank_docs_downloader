THE CBRT PRESS RELEASE
ON
TURKISH LIRA DEPOSIT BUYING AUCTIONS PROGRAM FOR
JULY 2004
In July 2004, the Central Bank will continue to conduct Turkish lira deposit buying
auctions with a standard four-week maturity, as a supplement to its existing instruments at
Interbank Money Market with the aim of boosting its efforts to sterilize the excess Turkish
lira liquidity.
As in June 2004, Turkish lira deposit buying auctions with a standard four-week
maturity will be held on every Wednesday. There will be no upper limit at each auction.
