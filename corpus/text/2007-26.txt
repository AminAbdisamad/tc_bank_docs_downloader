THE CENTRAL BANK OF THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY  
PRESS RELEASE 
 
As known, the CBRT holds foreign exchange buying auctions in order to build 
up foreign exchange reserves in concord with the functioning and core principles of 
the floating exchange rate regime within the framework of the programs announced 
to the public. These auctions are intended to be carried out mainly in line with the 
program announced, however auction programs can be subj ect to changes with a 
prior notice as may be required by unexpected significant developments related to foreign exchange supply.    
Hence, though the maximum daily FX amount to be purchased in daily 
auctions for 2007 had been set as a maximum amount of USD  45 million, USD 15 
million of which as the auction amount and USD 30 million as the optional selling 
amount, the auction amount was increased to be effective as of 25 July 2007 in view 
of the end of general selection process and positive expectations relating to 
macroeconomic policies as well as the projections for strong capital inflows. 
However, the auction amount was re- reduced to USD 15 million from 15 August 2007 
onwards due to increased volatility in Turkey along with other emerging markets because o f unfavorable developments in the housing and credit markets of 
developed countries during the said period.  
Yet, the measures towards easing the problems experienced by central banks 
in the housing and credit markets triggered strong capital inflows to Turkey along with 
other developing countries via reducing the volatilities in these markets and 
generating a further increase in global risk appetite.  Therefore, the maximum daily 
amount to be purchased in daily auctions to be held as of October 9, 2007 has  been 
increased to a maximum amount of USD 90 million, USD 30 million of which as auction amount and USD 60 million as optional selling amount. Other auction 
conditions remained unchanged.   As repeatedly underlined in our previous announcements, the developments 
pertaining to foreign exchange supply will closely be monitored in the upcoming 
period and in the event of unforeseen developments, not only that the daily 
auction/optional selling amounts may be changed in either direction with prior notice, 
but al so may the auctions be suspended for a short or long period.
