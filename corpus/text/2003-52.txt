THE CBRT PRESS RELEASE 
ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE BUYING AUCTIONS 
Considering that strong reserve position would boos t the marketâ€™s confidence in the 
current program and observing the excess foreign ex change supply, the Central Bank of 
Turkey (CBRT) has been conducting daily foreign exc hange buying auctions since 6 May 
2003. In our recent press release of 20 October 200 3, the amount of daily auctions was 
revised, and it was also announced that the CBRT mi ght, with a prior notice, suspend the 
auctions before the end of the period in the cases where the depth of foreign exchange market 
is lost and excessive volatility is observed in exc hange rates due to an exogenous shock or 
unpredictable developments.  
Given the volatility currently observed in foreign exchange market arising from the 
decline in the foreign exchange supply, the CBRT ha s suspended its daily foreign exchange 
buying auctions effective from 23 October 2003. In case there should be an increase in the 
foreign exchange supply in the next period, the CBR T may, with a prior notice, resume 
holding foreign exchange buying auctions. 
As usual, the CBRT will continue to closely monitor  the volatility in exchange rates 
and will directly intervene in the market in case o f an excessive volatility in both directions.
