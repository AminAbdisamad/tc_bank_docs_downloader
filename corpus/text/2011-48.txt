With the reduction in Turkish lira required reserve  ratios, the currently available 
data suggests that liquidity amounting to approxima tely 11 billion Turkish lira will be 
permanently supplied to the market, and the weighte d average required reserve ratio, 
which is 12.6 percent will come down to 10.5 percen t. 
On the other hand, for meeting the TL liquidity requirement of the Tur kish banking 
system permanently and at a lower cost, while at th e same time bolstering the build-up of the 
Central Bank’s FX reserves, the upper limit for FX reserves that may be held to meet Turkish 
lira reserve requirements is raised from 20 percent  to 40 percent of lira liabilities. Thus, the 
Bank’s FX reserves are expected to increase by abou t USD 4.7 billion if this additional 
facility in question is utilized in full. 
This revision will be effective as of the calculati on period dated 28 October 2011 
and required reserves calculated using the new rati os will start to be maintained as of 11 
November 2011.
