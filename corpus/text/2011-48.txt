With the reduction in Turkish lira required reserve ratios, the currently available
data suggests that liquidity amounting to approximately 11 billion Turkish lira will be
permanently supplied to the market, and the weighted average required reserve ratio,
which is 12.6 percent will come down to 10.5 percent.
On the other hand, for meeting the TL liquidity requirement of the Turkish banking
system permanently and at a lower cost, while at the same time bolstering the build-up of the
Central Bank’s FX reserves, the upper limit for FX reserves that may be held to meet Turkish
lira reserve requirements is raised from 20 percent to 40 percent of lira liabilities. Thus, the
Bank’s FX reserves are expected to increase by about USD 4.7 billion if this additional
facility in question is utilized in full.
This revision will be effective as of the calculation period dated 28 October 2011
and required reserves calculated using the new ratios will start to be maintained as of 11
November 2011.
