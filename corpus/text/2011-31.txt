SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: August 4, 2011
Global Developments
1. Monetary Policy Committee (Committee) has assessed the recent
developments, evaluating the risk scenarios summarized in the Inflation
Report, which were also assessed in the July, 21st 2011 meeting.
2. The Committee indicated that concerns regarding sovereign debt problems in
some European economies and the global growth outlook have continued to
intensify, increasing the risks highlighted in the July Committee meeting.
Particularly, sovereign debt problems have spread from the peripheral
countries of the Euro area to some core countries, and consequently,
sovereign borrowing costs in Spain and Italy have reached historically high
levels. These developments have significantly increased the uncertainties
regarding global economy. Moreover, recent indicators on global economic
activity have pointed to an increasingly worsening outlook and have been
significantly below expectations, speeding up the deterioration in the risk
appetite.
3. Accordingly, the Committee has approved the implementation of a
comprehensive package which has been prepared by the Central Bank in
order to contain the adverse effects of the prevailing global problems on
domestic markets. The Committee has emphasized that the effects of the
monetary policy on the economic activity are observed with some lag and thus
the timing of the decision is important.

Measures Regarding Markets
4. In order to prepare the ground for an effective liquidity management in case of
a further deterioration in the global risk appetite, the following measures were
taken regarding Turkish lira and foreign exchange markets
o In order to limit the potential downside volatility in the short-term interest
rates in case of a need for a rapid injection of liquidity to the market, the
Committee has decided to narrow the interest rate corridor via
increasing the overnight borrowing rate by 350 basis points.

o A technical adjustment was approved to increase the efficiency of the
central bank liquidity management and to facilitate a more balanced
provision of liquidity across the system. To this end, it was agreed that
each participating institutionâ€™s bid for the weekly repo auctions could be
limited by 20percent of the total auction amount.
o In order to mitigate the fluctuations in the repo interest rates, it was
agreed that the terms for maintenance period of reserve requirements
would be changed. Accordingly, it was approved that the repo
transactions that are subject to required reserves would be computed
by taking the average of daily balances between two calculation
periods, instead of being computed bi-weekly on Fridays.
5. Moreover, The Committee has agreed to closely monitor the developments,
and if necessary, take measures to provide foreign exchange liquidity via
appropriate methods and instruments. In this context;
o It was approved that foreign exchange liquidity would be provided to the
market through foreign exchange selling auctions starting from August
5, 2011, on the days deemed necessary.
o Along the same line, it was agreed that reserve requirement rates on
foreign exchange liabilities would be decreased, when necessary.
o It was agreed that a measured cut could be exercised for the interest
rates at which banks are able to borrow foreign exchange from the
Central Bank with one-week maturity, currently at 5.50 for USD and
6.50 for EURO, through the Foreign Exchange Deposit Market within
the predetermined limits.
6. Overall, these measures aim at laying out the ground for a timely, controlled
and effective provision of liquidity to the market in case of a possible financial
turmoil that may be triggered by global developments.

Macroeconomic Outlook and Policy Rates
7. It was emphasized that, the implications of existing conditions on inflation and
current account deficit have been already assessed thoroughly in the
preceding meeting of the Committee and it has been agreed that the
formulated policy measures would minimize the risks regarding price and
financial stability.

8. The Committee has indicated that both the credit volume and the domestic
demand decelerate at a desired pace due to the measures taken so far.In this
respect, monthly current account balance is expected to improve steadily.
9. Recently, both the worsening outlook for global economic activity and rapidly
increasing concerns on the debt sustainability in Europe has increased the risk
of a renewed slowdown in the global economy.
10. The Committee members anticipate that the deteriorating growth outlook in
Italy and Spain, our major trade partners, could have an adverse impact on
external demand, whereas domestic demand would continue to moderate due
to rising global uncertainty. Therefore, the ongoing slowdown in the domestic
economic activity is expected to continue in the forthcoming period.
11. In light of these assessments, the Committee has indicated that the probability
of the materialization of downside risks regarding global economy mentioned
in the Inflation Report has increased. Consequently, a measured policy rate
cut was delivered, and it was agreed that necessary liquidity support should be
provided to the banking system.
12. The Committee has reiterated that these measures have contained the
downside risks for our economy to a considerable extent; however, given the
existing state of the global economy, it is important to monitor all
developments closely, and to give the required policy response in a timely
manner.
