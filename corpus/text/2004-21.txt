THE CBRT PRESS RELEASE
ON
FOREIGN EXCHANGE BUYING AUCTIONS

The Central Bank of Turkey (CBRT) has been holding daily foreign exchange buying
auctions since 23 January 2004, considering that strong reserve position would boost the
marketâ€™s confidence in the current program and observing the significant excess foreign
exchange supply in foreign exchange markets since January. The amounts of daily foreign
exchange auction have recently been changed with our press release of 14 April 2004. As
always, it was also announced that, the CBRT might, with a prior notice, suspend the auctions
before the end of the period in the cases where the depth of foreign exchange market is lost,
and excessive volatility is observed in exchange rates due to an exogenous shock or
unpredictable developments.
In this context, the CBRT has decided to suspend daily foreign exchange buying
auctions starting from 27 April 2004 (today) until 3 May 2004, due to the decrease in bid
amounts at the auctions and the volatility observed in the foreign exchange market. In the
May 2004 Auction Program to be announced on 30 April 2004, which is the last working day
of April, the CBRT will make public whether the auctions would resume or not, and the
amounts of daily foreign exchange buying auction and optional selling in case of resumption
of the auctions, by considering the foreign exchange volatility that could be observed in the
coming days, and the direction of the excess foreign exchange supply, in close touch with the
market players.
As usual, the CBRT will continue to closely monitor the volatility in exchange rates
and will directly intervene in the markets in the event of an excessive volatility that might
occur in either directions.
