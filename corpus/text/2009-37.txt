SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: December 17, 2009

Inflation Developments
1. Consumer prices increased by 1.27 percent in November, driving annual
inflation up by 0.45 percentage points to 5.53 percent year-on-year, largely
due to rising unprocessed food prices. When unprocessed food, energy and
gold are excluded, November outturn represents one of the lowest monthly
inflation rates recorded in recent years. In addition, the behavior of
subcategories does not point to a deterioration in the general pricing behavior.
Overall, the November rise in annual inflation is mainly attributable to
transitory factors and base effects, and thus underlying trend inflation remains
subdued.
2. Food prices have been the major factor underlying the recent increase in
inflation. In particular, unprocessed food prices have remained volatile over
the year. After having registered the lowest third quarter rate of change in five
years, unprocessed food prices ran above seasonal averages during the last
two months owing to higher fruit/vegetable and meat prices, which is expected
to continue into December. In contrast, the outlook regarding processed food
prices remains favorable.
3. Having picked up due to hikes in electricity tariffs during October, energy
prices continued to rise in November in line with international oil prices. The
annual rate of increase in energy prices is expected to accelerate in coming
months owing to base effects. The drop in commodity prices during the final
quarter of 2008 had driven energy prices down sharply starting from
December 2008. Therefore, the resulting impact of these base effects on
inflation is expected to be visible starting from December 2009.
4. Owing to the expiration of the temporary tax cuts, the annual rate of increase
in the prices of goods excluding energy and food continued to increase in
November. Underpinning this development was the 7.61 percent rise in gold
prices owing to soaring international prices as well as the increase in clothing
and footwear inflation that was driven by the low base effects from a year ago.
5. Annual services inflation continued along a downtrend during November.
Annual rental inflation declined further, while prices for transport and other

services dropped modestly. Higher meat prices had a more moderate impact
on restaurants and hotels than in the previous two months. Thus, annual
inflation in the overall services index decreased to historically low levels.
6. In sum, the Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) stated that the
upcoming period would be marked by strong base effects, particularly leading
to a sizeable increase in annual inflation in December. Yet, the Committee
expects core inflation to remain at low levels.

Factors Affecting Inflation
7. Third quarter national accounts releases were consistent with the outlook
presented in the October Inflation Report. Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
continued to grow quarter-on-quarter, albeit slowly. In particular, the data
confirmed that after a robust second quarter, private consumption moderated
as tax cuts were phased out. Meanwhile, private investments have recovered
slightly quarter-on-quarter for the first time in a long while. Taken together,
total final domestic demand has remained flat.
8. Recent readings suggest that the economy is on track for moderate recovery.
Industrial production increased by 6.5 percent year-on-year during October
2009, which was the first year-on-year positive growth rate for a long period of
time. However, the Committee attributed the production growth largely to
working-day effects and noted that industrial production continued to contract
year-on-year after adjusting for calendar-related effects. The Committee
expects calendar effects to remain prevalent during November and December,
and emphasizes that year-on-year comparisons should be based on calendaradjusted data.
9. The Committee indicated that industrial production grew markedly month-onmonth during October, even in seasonally adjusted terms. Yet, production is
likely to fluctuate beyond seasonal patterns during the month of Ramadan and
the ensuing religious holiday period, and therefore assessments regarding
production should not rely on a single month’s realization. Accordingly,
comparing the September-October period with the July-August period suggest
that industrial production is on a moderate recovery path in seasonally
adjusted terms. Thus, it should be noted that it would be inappropriate to
conclude a strong and durable recovery in production, based solely on the
October data.
10. Leading indicators suggest that the pace of growth continued to slow in the
fourth quarter. With the expiration of all tax incentives, the underlying trend for
consumption demand has moderated. The unfavorable outlook continues for
spending categories more sensitive to current income. The Committee

members noted that, given the precarious labor market conditions, the
demand for categories sensitive to current income might continue to be weak.
In seasonally adjusted terms, the production of consumer goods remained
virtually unchanged in October from a quarter ago, while imports, especially of
passenger cars, contracted. Consumer confidence and consumption indices
confirm this weak outlook. Therefore, consumption demand is expected to
remain mostly flat during the final quarter.
11. Among the factors restraining capacity utilization across manufacturing
industries, the share of insufficient domestic demand continued to increase,
while the role attributed to weak foreign markets remains high. In addition,
aggregate demand uncertainty continues to suppress investment demand.
Considering both production and import data, investment demand is expected
to recover further during the fourth quarter, yet remain at low levels. The
Committee restated that the idle capacity resulting from low resource
utilization is likely to have a dampening effect on investment demand for quite
some time.
12. Foreign demand remains weak. In this context, the absence of a strong and
sustained turnaround in industrial production continues to restrain services
sectors with strong industrial linkages, such as trade and
transport/communication as well as the outlook for economic activity and
employment prospects more generally. In fact, closer inspection of the
industrial composition reveals that trade-related services sectors seem to have
been particularly more affected by foreign demand conditions. Therefore,
without a marked improvement in foreign demand and/or significant
diversification in export markets, economic recovery is not likely. Hence, the
Committee reiterated its expectation that aggregate demand would recover
gradually.
13. Uncertainties regarding aggregate demand linger, and employment conditions

are expected to take a long time to fully recover. In fact, unemployment rose
by 2.7 percentage points to 13.4 percent year-on-year during September
2009, while non-farm unemployment increased by 3.5 percentage points yearon-year. The labor force participation rate continues to have an adverse
impact on the unemployment rate. After hitting a record high in May 2009,
non-farm and overall unemployment rates have recently recovered in
seasonally adjusted terms, albeit modestly. The end of the decline in industrial
employment was viewed by the Committee as an important development.
However, given the slow pace of recovery in employment, the unemployment
rate is likely to remain elevated for a long time.

Monetary Policy and Risks
14. The collapse of global demand and commodity prices after the intensification
of the global crisis during the last quarter of 2008 had been followed by a
sharp fall in inflation. Accordingly, annual inflation―the year-on-year rate of
change in the consumer price index―is likely to display upward movements
owing to base effects, although monthly rate of changes in prices are expected
to hover at moderate levels. The Committee therefore stated that strong base
effects could lead to a significant increase in annual inflation in the forthcoming
period, especially in December; yet core inflation would remain at low levels.
Annual inflation could display upward movements through mid-2010 by the
same token, yet this possibility had already been reflected in the monetary
stance outlined in the October Inflation Report.
15. The Committee indicated that the economic activity is on a moderate but
stable upward trend. However, resource utilization, hence inflation, is expected
to stay around low levels in the medium term, given the existing low levels of
capital and labor utilization. Therefore, core inflation indicators would display a
modest pace, and hence annual inflation is expected to revert back to a
declining trend in the last quarter of 2010, ending the year below the target.
16. The policy rate cuts implemented since November 2008, and the
improvements in global risk perceptions have started to exert favorable effects
on credit markets. Committee members have also underscored the important
role of the sound domestic banking system in supporting the recovery in credit
markets. However, the ongoing tightness in lending standards regarding credit
to small- and medium-sized enterprises as well as longer-term loans is still a
factor restraining economic activity.
17. Although recent data releases indicate that the worst is likely to be over,
concerns regarding the strength of the global recovery remain. Accordingly,
taking into account that lingering problems across the global economy have
yet to be resolved completely and there are still uncertainties regarding the
strength of the recovery, the Committee, in line with the policy stance
presented in the Inflation Report, emphasized that it would be necessary to
keep policy rates at low levels for a long period of time.
18. In particular, ongoing problems in credit and labor markets pose downside
risks for global activity. Should global conditions deteriorate again, and
consequently delay the domestic recovery, another cycle of rate cuts would be
considered. Committee members stated that although materialization of this
scenario has become less likely, it should not be completely disregarded.
19. According to the Committee members, another possible scenario involves a
surge in capital inflows to emerging markets owing to the relative improvement

of credit risk across these countries. Ample liquidity driven by the
expansionary fiscal and monetary policies on a worldwide scale, coupled with
rising risk appetites, have led to large capital inflows to emerging markets.
Given the current slack across the economy, a fall in the cost of imported
inputs could be rapidly transmitted to consumer prices, suggesting that a
further acceleration in capital inflows may exacerbate downward risks on
inflation. Realization of such a scenario could lead to temporarily lower policy
rates.
20. The course of oil and other commodity prices constitutes another important
risk factor. Ample liquidity driven by countercyclical policies on a global scale
has encouraged speculative investments not only into emerging market
currencies, but also into commodities. Therefore, oil and other commodity
price developments warrant careful surveillance, even under a scenario of a
gradual global economic recovery. Nonetheless, weak domestic demand
conditions would limit the pass-through stemming from upside cost-push
shocks. Therefore, the Committee will not react to short-term commodity price
volatility, especially when resource utilization remains at depressed levels.
However, if an uptrend in commodity prices reflects a strong and durable
rebound in global activity that would in turn create inflationary pressures, then
monetary policy will react appropriately to keep inflation in line with the
medium-term inflation targets.
21. The Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) will continue to monitor fiscal policy
developments closely while formulating monetary policy. Enhancing the
framework set out in the Medium Term Program (MTP) through further
structural adjustments to strengthen fiscal discipline, would support the
improvement of Turkey’s sovereign risk. Should the goals set out in the MTP
be implemented, it would be possible to keep policy rates at single digits
throughout the medium term.
22. The CBT has been taking the necessary measures to contain the adverse
effects of the global financial turmoil on the domestic economy. However,
prudent monetary policy is necessary, but not sufficient to maintain the
resilience of the economy against the global crisis. Therefore, strengthening
the commitment to fiscal discipline and the structural reform agenda is also
critical for facilitating expectations management and thus for supporting the
effectiveness of the monetary policy decisions. In this respect, timely
implementation of the structural reforms envisaged by the Medium Term
Program and European Union accession process remains to be of utmost
importance.
