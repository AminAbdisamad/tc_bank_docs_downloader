PRESS RELEASE ON THE MAXIMUM INTEREST RATES TO BE APPLIED TO
CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS
The monthly maximum interest rates to be applied to credit card
transactions are left unchanged.
The monthly maximum contractual and overdue interest rates to be applied to
credit card transactions, which were set with the CBRT Communiqué No. 2013/11 on
the Amendment to the Communiqué No. 2006/1 on Maximum Interest Rates To Be
Applied To Credit Card Transactions published in the Official Gazette No: 28765
dated 14 September 2013 and which took effect as of 1 October 2013, will continue
to be valid for the 3-month period starting on 1 October 2014.
Accordingly, the monthly maximum contractual interest rate to be applied to
credit card transactions from 1 October 2014 to 31 December 2014 is 2.02 percent
for the Turkish lira, 1.70 percent for the US dollar and 1.64 percent for the Euro,
whereas the monthly maximum overdue interest rate is 2.52 percent for the Turkish
lira, 2.20 percent for the US dollar and 2.14 percent for the Euro.
As of 1 October 2014, the contractual and overdue interest rates to be applied
by banks to credit card transactions will not exceed the above-mentioned maximum
rates. Banks are free to determine their respective rates at their own discretion
provided that they are below the ceiling rates. The maximum contractual and overdue
interest rates, which will be valid for the 3-month period starting on 1 January 2015
will be announced by the CBRT prior to this date.
Banks in Turkey, as is the case with the banks in other countries, set the credit
card interest rates higher than those on consumer loans. Therefore, the CBRT
advises credit card holders to prefer consumer loans rather than personal credit
cards to meet their short-term credit needs.
