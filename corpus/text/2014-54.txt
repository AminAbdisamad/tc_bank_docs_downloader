PRESS RELEASE ON THE MAXIMUM INTEREST RATES TO BE A PPLIED TO 
CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS 
The monthly maximum interest rates to be applied to  credit card 
transactions are left unchanged.  
The monthly maximum contractual and overdue interes t rates to be applied to 
credit card transactions, which were set with the C BRT Communiqué No. 2013/11 on 
the Amendment to the Communiqué No. 2006/1 on Maxim um Interest Rates To Be 
Applied To Credit Card Transactions published in th e Official Gazette No: 28765 
dated 14 September 2013 and which took effect as of  1 October 2013, will continue 
to be valid for the 3-month period starting on 1 Oc tober 2014. 
Accordingly, the monthly maximum contractual intere st rate to be applied to 
credit card transactions from 1 October 2014 to 31 December 2014 is 2.02 percent 
for the Turkish lira, 1.70 percent for the US dolla r and 1.64 percent for the Euro, 
whereas the monthly maximum overdue interest rate i s 2.52 percent for the Turkish 
lira, 2.20 percent for the US dollar and 2.14 perce nt for the Euro.  
As of 1 October 2014, the contractual and overdue i nterest rates to be applied 
by banks to credit card transactions will not excee d the above-mentioned maximum 
rates. Banks are free to determine their respective  rates at their own discretion 
provided that they are below the ceiling rates. The  maximum contractual and overdue 
interest rates, which will be valid for the 3-month  period starting on 1 January 2015 
will be announced by the CBRT prior to this date.  
Banks in Turkey, as is the case with the banks in o ther countries, set the credit 
card interest rates higher than those on consumer l oans. Therefore, the CBRT 
advises credit card holders to prefer consumer loan s rather than personal credit 
cards to meet their short-term credit needs.
