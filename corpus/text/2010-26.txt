The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep one-week
repo auction rate (the policy rate) and overnight rates unchanged as follows:
a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) at 7 percent,
b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 6.50 percent, lending rate at 9
percent,
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.):
Borrowing rate at 2.50 percent, lending rate at 12 percent,
d) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities
provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 8 percent.
Recent data releases are in line with the outlook presented in the July Inflation
Report. There are signs of a partial slowdown in the external demand, while domestic
demand displays a relatively stable outlook. Therefore, it would take a while before
industrial capacity utilization rates return to their pre-crisis levels. Although employment
conditions continue to improve, unemployment rates remain at high levels. Moreover,
risks regarding the global economy remain significant.
The Committee has restated that inflation would increase temporarily in the short
term before reverting to a declining path starting from the last quarter of the year. Core
inflation indicators are expected to remain consistent with the medium-term targets.
In light of these developments, the Committee reiterated that it would be
necessary to maintain policy rates at current levels for some time, and to keep them at
low levels for a long period.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation
outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within
eight working days.
