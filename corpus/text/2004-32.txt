PRESS RELEASE

The interest rate on TL required reserves is decreased to 12.5 percent, by cutting
1.5 percentage points, to be effective from 25 August 2004.
With the aim of contributing to the efficient and effective functioning of banks by
alleviating their financial intermediation costs, TL required reserves and FX required reserves
have begun to be remunerated starting from 8.8.2001 and from 24.5.2002 respectively, in
order to reduce the funding costs of required reserves maintained in the Central Bank without
being remunerated.
The interest rate applied to TL required reserves was decreased recently to 14 percent
with a cut of 2 percentage points to be effective from 22.03.2004 and it was announced that
the interest rate applied to TL required reserves is held in the range between 75 to 80 percent
of the simple weighted average interest rate for Turkish lira denominated deposits and
determined in line with the changes in interest rates applied by banks on deposits.
The interest rate applied to TL required reserves has been set as 12.5 percent, with a
cut of 1.5 percentage points, to be effective from 25 August 2004, by taking into
consideration the declines in interest rates applied by banks for Turkish lira denominated
deposits since 22.03.2004.
As before, the interest rate applicable to FX required reserves shall continue to be
determined weekly, and shall be equivalent to the interest rate on 2-days notice FX deposits
that the banks hold as free deposits with the Central Bank.
