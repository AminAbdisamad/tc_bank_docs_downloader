Meeting Date: May 29, 2012

The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term
interest rates constant at the following levels:
a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) at 5.75 percent,
b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 5 percent, lending rate at 11.5 percent,
the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions
at 11 percent,
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing
rate at 0 percent, lending rate at 14.5 percent.
Recent data confirm that the rebalancing between the domestic and external demand
continues as envisaged. While consumption demand shows a significant slowdown in the first
quarter, leading indicators suggest a modest recovery for the second quarter. Exports continue
to grow at a steady pace. Accordingly, the improvement in the current account balance is
expected to continue in the forthcoming period.
Although inflation will display a marked drop in May, it is expected to stay significantly
above the target until the last quarter of the year. Accordingly, the current tight policy stance will
be maintained in the forthcoming period in order to contain risks regarding pricing behavior. The
Committee therefore continues to forecast the year-end inflation to be at 6.5 percent stated in
the April Inflation Report.
The Committee stated that, given the prevailing uncertainties regarding the global
economy, it would be appropriate to preserve the flexibility of the monetary policy. Therefore,
the impact of the measures undertaken on credit, domestic demand, and inflation expectations
will be monitored closely and the funding amount will be adjusted in either direction, as needed.
In this respect, shorter episodes of additional monetary tightening may also be implemented,
when necessary.
Moreover, in order to support financial stability, the Committee has approved a limited
increase in the flexibility regarding the allowance to hold Turkish lira reserve requirements in
foreign currency.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to
revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five
working days.
