PRESS RELEASE
ON
INTEREST RATES TO BE APPLIED ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEPOSIT
ACCOUNTS WITH CREDIT LETTERS AND SUPER FX ACCOUNTS

With an amendment made to some articles of the Central Bank Circular No: I/M, the opening
of Foreign Exchange Deposit Accounts with Credit Letters for one-year maturity has been
abolished. Moreover, the interest rates applicable to the Foreign Exchange Deposit Accounts
with Credit Letters and Super FX Accounts have been revised as follows:
Foreign Exchange Deposit Accounts with Credit Letters
The application of opening Euro, USD, Swiss franc and UK pound-denominated Foreign
Exchange Deposit Accounts with Credit Letters for one-year maturity has ended. The Euro,
USD, Swiss franc and UK pound-denominated accounts, which are opened before 6 March
2006 for one-year maturity, will be automatically renewed at the 0,25 percent interest rate as of
the end of maturity, unless otherwise instructed by the account owners.
Interest Rates for Foreign Exchange Deposit Accounts with Credit Letters for two-year
maturity:
The annual interest rates applicable to those accounts with two-year maturity remain
unchanged. Namely, the interest rate for Euro and USD-denominated accounts is 2,75 percent,
for Swiss franc-denominated accounts is 0,75 percent and for UK pound-denominated accounts
is 4 percent.

Interest Rates for Super FX Deposit Accounts
Interest rates for Euro-denominated Super FX accounts are lowered to 2,25 percent from 3
percent for one-year maturity, to 3,25 percent from 3,50 percent for two-year maturity and to
3,75 percent from 4 percent for three-year maturity.
Interest rates for USD-denominated FX accounts that are 3 percent for one-year maturity,
3,75 percent for two-year maturity and 4,5 percent for three-years maturity remain the same.
Moreover, the interest rate applicable to the amount withdrawn before the maturity date is
lowered to 0,05 percent from 0,25 percent for Foreign Exchange Deposit Account with Credit
Letters and Super FX Deposit Accounts.
The amendments and new interest rates shall take effect as of 6 March 2006.
