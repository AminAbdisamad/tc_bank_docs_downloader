ANNOUNCEMENT ON BUSINESS TENDENCY SURVEY

The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey has been conducting a monthly Business
Tendency Survey since 1987 with the aim of revealing the assessments and
expectations of the senior managers of the firms operating in economic sectors on the
general economic tendencies. The aggregated results of this survey have been
published

on

this

web

site

(http://www.tcmb.gov.tr)

under

the

title

“Publications/Periodic Publications/Business Tendency Survey and Real Sector
Confidence Index”.

To be effective from January 2007, some of the survey questions are modified and the
scope of survey units are expanded with the purpose of harmonizing the survey with the
“Industry Survey” conducted within the European Union countries. With these changes,
the aggregated survey results of January and February will be published before March
15, 2007, in our web site.
