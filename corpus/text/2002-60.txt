           CENTRAL BANK OF THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY  
                           PRESS RELEASE  
 
The interest rate on TL required reserves is raised to 25 
percent, with a 3 percentage points increase, to be effective from 
09.07.2002 (today).  
Within the process of carrying out the banking reform effectively, 
with the aim of decreasing financial intermediation costs, starting from 
08.08.2001 TL re quired reserves and starting from 24.05.2002 FX required 
reserves have begun to be remunerated to reduce the funding costs of 
required reserves maintained in the Central Bank without being remunerated.  
The interest rate applied to TL required reserves whi ch is 
determined by taking into consideration the interest rates banks apply to 
deposits as well as the balance sheet of the Central Bank and its monetary 
policy, was reduced to 22 percent to be effective from 24.05.2002, 
considering the expansion in the c alculation base for required reserves 
brought along with the Communiqu√© on required reserves No: 2002/1 and the 
decrease in the interest rates on deposits. Also, it was announced that this 
rate would be revised in line with the developments in interest rat es on 
deposits.  
Although there is no significant change in interest rates applied to TL 
deposits, in order to contribute to the effective and efficient functioning of 
banks by decreasing the financial intermediation costs in the banking 
system, interest ra te on TL required reserves is increased, by 3 percentage 
points, to 25 percent to be effective from 09.07.2002. In this regard, the 
interest rate on TL required reserves has converged to the market interest 
rates, and might be revised in parallel to the de velopments.  
As before, the interest rate applicable to FX required reserves shall 
continue to be determined weekly and to be equivalent to the interest rate on 2-days notice FX deposits that the banks hold as free deposits in the 
Central Bank.
