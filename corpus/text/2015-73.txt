SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 22 December2015
Inflation Developments
1. In November, consumer prices increased by 0.67 percent, and annual inflation
edged up by 0.52 points to 8.10 percent. Annual food inflation increased on account
of the unprocessed food prices, while the annual energy inflation rose due to the
base effect. Meanwhile, the effects of depreciation in the Turkish lira, albeit waning,
pushed annual inflation in core goods further upwards. Annual services inflation
maintained its high levels. Thus, annual inflation of core indicators recorded an
increase, while the underlying trend of inflation implied by seasonally adjusted data
remained flat.
2. Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 0.83 points to 9.51
percent in November. This was driven by annual unprocessed food inflation that
climbed to 11.48 percent mostly due to rising prices of vegetables. On the processed
food front, the downward trend in annual inflation continued. Energy prices edged
down by 0.31 percent in tandem with the decline in fuel prices, while the annual
energy inflation increased to 1.26 percent due to base effect in November. The
annual energy inflation is projected to increase further in December on account of
the base effect.
3. Prices of services increased by 0.17 percent, and annual services inflation rose by
0.16 points to 8.80 percent in November. Annual inflation slowed in the restaurantshotels group, but edged up in other sub-groups. The seasonally-adjusted data
indicated a slight slowdown in the underlying trend of services inflation in
November.
4. Annual core goods inflation rose by 0.41 points to 9.61 percent in November. The
cumulative depreciation in the Turkish lira continued to affect core inflation despite
alleviating in certain items. Monthly price increases in durable goods decelerated in
November following higher levels in the preceding two months. However, clothing
prices remained on an increasing path. As a consequence, seasonally-adjusted data
indicated an increase in the underlying trend of core goods inflation. Meanwhile,

the annual inflation in core goods excluding clothing and durables reached 8.67
percent in November.
5. In sum, lagged effects of the exchange rate movements continued to delay the
improvement in inflation, but the decline in oil prices contained this effect. Against
this backdrop, core inflation remained on an upward trend in November.

Factors Affecting Inflation
6. According to data released by TURKSTAT, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by
4.0 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2015. In seasonally-adjusted terms,
national income maintained its robust growth, posting an increase by 1.3 percent
quarter-on-quarter. On the expenditure side, net exports made a considerably high
contribution to quarterly growth amid the rise in exports and decline in imports.
Consumption spending continued to expand, while investment spending remained
relatively weak in this quarter.
7. Owing to the base effect from number of working days, industrial production
registered a notable year-on-year growth in October. In seasonally and calendaradjusted terms, October production figure was flat compared to the previous
month, but 1.0 percent higher than the third-quarter average. Among indicators of
November, the manufacture of vehicles and electricity generation receded. The
Business Tendency Survey data and the PMI indicators for the last three months
point to an increase in production due to waning domestic uncertainties.
Accordingly, industrial production is projected to rise on a quarterly basis in the last
quarter of the year.
8. Data on the expenditure side suggest a more moderate demand growth in the last
quarter. Following a slight decline in the third quarter, sales of automobiles
remained below the previous quarterâ€™s average in the October-November period.
Sales of white goods also recorded a decline in the October-November period.
Imports of investment goods receded on a monthly basis. Indicators of construction
investment exhibit a mild pattern, while future investment expectations of firms
point to a recovery in the October-November period. In sum, domestic demand is
likely to provide a modest contribution to growth in the last quarter.
9. Recent rebound in confidence indicators ease the downside risks to economic
activity. Business survey data indicate that export orders over the last three months
recorded an improvement in the October-November period, while domestic orders,
which remained moderate in the first three quarters, assumed a recovery trend
recently. Moreover, the consumer confidence has increased notably. Likewise,
investment and employment prospects improved in the October-November period.
Against this background, confidence channel is expected to boost domestic demand
in the upcoming period.

10. Current account balance continues to improve. Although geopolitical tensions still
weigh on export growth, the robust increasing trend in exports to Europe provides
support to growth and rebalancing. Current account balance is expected to further
improve in the upcoming period, owing to the lagged effects of the fall in oil prices
and the slowdown in credit growth.
11. In September 2015, non-farm unemployment rate recorded a limited decline upon
the increase in employment. Labor force in non-farm sectors trended upwards in
this period. Among sectors, industrial employment claimed the highest rate of
increase in September following a decline of three quarters in a row. Employment in
the construction sector edged up, while that in the services sector followed a robust
course. Going ahead, industrial production and survey indicators signal a mild
increase in employment. Given the economic outlook, the current trends in services
and construction employment is expected to be maintained. Overall, non-farm
unemployment may recede in the last quarter of the year.
12. To sum up, recent indicators suggest that domestic demand follows a more
moderate course in the last quarter of the year, while external demand offers
positive contribution to growth. Although geopolitical tensions pose a downside risk
to external demand, the recovery in the European economies contributes to
external demand. Meanwhile, the recovery in consumer confidence as well as
investment and employment prospects amid waning domestic uncertainties is likely
to support domestic demand in the upcoming period. Hence, economic activity is
expected to maintain a stable growth trend.

Monetary Policy and Risks
13. Annual loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary
policy stance and macroprudential measures. Although loan growth has recently
displayed a downward trend, the recovery in financial conditions and higher
revenues due to wage hikes are expected to support loan growth in the upcoming
period. Commercial loans continue to grow at a faster pace than consumer loans.
Such a composition not only limits medium-term inflationary pressures but also
supports the improvement in the current account balance.
14. In the third quarter of the year, growth composition turned in favor of net exports
on a quarterly basis. Following a robust trend in the first half, domestic demand
displayed a milder course in the second half of the year, as projected. Although the
geopolitical tension resides as a downward risk to external demand, this risk is
contained by the flexibility of our exports in shifting markets. In fact, Turkish exports
towards the European Union countries recently gained considerable momentum.
Moreover, favorable developments in the terms of trade and the deceleration in
consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance.

Therefore, the annual current account deficit is expected to narrow further in the
upcoming period.
15. The Committee stated that the desired improvement in the inflation outlook is yet
to be seen. Although energy price developments continue to affect inflation
favorably, cumulative exchange rate movements delay the improvement in the core
inflation trend. Exchange rates followed a relatively stable course during the final
quarter of the year amid easing domestic uncertainties and the significant
improvement in the current account balance. However, the lagged pass-through
from the cumulative depreciation in the first three quarters continued to have an
adverse impact on inflation. Accordingly, core inflation indicators are expected to
remain at high levels in the short run. In addition, year-end unprocessed food
inflation is likely to exceed the October Inflation Report projections. The effect of
higher-than-targeted inflation on expectations and the acceleration in wage
increases necessitate close monitoring of the overall pricing behavior. Against this
backdrop, the Committee stated that the tight liquidity stance would be maintained
as long as deemed necessary.
16. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the factors affecting the
inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, the pricing behavior
and developments in other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy
stance will be maintained.
17. The Committee stated that the wide interest rate corridor has contributed to
containing exchange rate volatility in times of heightened global volatility. The need
for such an instrument would be reduced, should the decline in volatility observed
after the start of the global policy normalization prove persistent.
18. Another factor reducing the need for a wide interest rate corridor is the effective
use of policy instruments laid out in the roadmap published in August. Excessive
fluctuations both in exchange rates and loans have waned owing to the launch and
effective use of these instruments.
19. In this respect, the Committee highlighted the significance of the measures to
stabilize the foreign exchange liquidity during the simplification process. To this end,
it was indicated that the automatic stabilizer feature of the ROM will be
strengthened before the monetary policy simplification, as elaborated in the
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2016. Moreover, it was reiterated that
conditions and limits regarding the pledge of foreign currency deposits as collateral
against Turkish lira operations might be revised before and during simplification.
20. Against this background, monetary policy simplification steps would begin with the
next meeting, should the decline in volatility prove persistent. The interest rate
corridor is aimed to be narrower and more symmetrical around the one-week repo
rate. The nature and the pace of simplification steps will depend on the factors
affecting the volatility in global and domestic markets.

21. Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with
regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance
is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and
there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices. A revision of the
monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate
significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the
medium-term inflation outlook.
22. Sustained fiscal discipline has become a fundamental element in reducing the
sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years. Given the
current environment of highly uncertain global markets, maintaining and further
advancing these achievements is significant. Any measure to ensure the
sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support
macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping
interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels.
