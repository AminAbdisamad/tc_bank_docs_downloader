Press Release on Securities 
Maintenance  
18 October  2022 No: 2022-41 
 
 
The Central Bank started to promote  the conversion from foreign currency deposits to Turkish lira 
deposits in the scope of the “liraization strategy”  in December 2021  and thus, took an important 
step towards reinforcing the preference for Turkish lira deposits. As a result of this practice, the 
share of Turkish lira in the balance sheets of banks has increased while their funding maturities 
have extended. Accordingly, the practice has  strengthened bank s’ balance sheets, thereby 
supporting financial stability.  
In the meantime, banks have realized  their conversion targets set by the Central Bank at the end 
of 2021, and complied  with  the Turkish Lira -Denominated Securities M aintenance practice  initiated  
as part of the “liraization strategy” .  
With the amendment made in th e Securities  Maintenance practice,  the securities maintenance 
ratio is revised as 5%. By the beginning of 2023 securities will be maintained based on the targets 
of the Turkish lira deposits share , instead of the conversion rat e.  
Further steps as part of the “liraization strategy” will be taken  in the rest of the year and in 2023.
