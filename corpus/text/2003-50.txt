PRESS RELEASE 
  
The interest rate on TL required reserves of banks is decreased to 19 
percent, by cutting 2 percentage points, to be effe ctive from 15 October 2003. 
With the aim of contributing to the efficient and e ffective functioning of banks 
by alleviating their financial intermediation costs , TL required reserves and FX required 
reserves have begun to be remunerated starting from  8 August 2001 and from 24 May 
2002 respectively, in order to reduce the funding c osts of required reserves 
maintained in the Central Bank (CBRT) without being  remunerated. 
The interest rate applied to TL required reserves w as decreased recently to 21 
percent with a cut of 2 percentage points to be eff ective from 19 September 2003 and 
it was announced that the interest rate applied to TL required reserves would be held in 
the range between 75 to 80 percent of the simple we ighted average interest rate for 
Turkish lira denominated deposits and be determined  in line with the changes in 
interest rates applied by banks on deposits. 
The interest rate applied to TL required reserves h as been set as 19 percent, 
with a cut of 2 percentage points, to be effective from 15 October 2003, by taking into 
consideration the declines in interest rates applie d by banks for Turkish lira 
denominated deposits since 19 September 2003, influ enced also by the reduction in 
borrowing rates applied by the CBRT. 
As before, the interest rate applicable to FX requi red reserves shall continue to 
be determined weekly, and shall be equivalent to th e interest rate on 2-days notice FX 
deposits that the banks hold as free deposits with the CBRT.
