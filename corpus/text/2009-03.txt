PRESS RELEASE ON OCTOBER 2008 BALANCE OF PAYMENTS STATISTICS 
 
 Regarding the October 2008 Balance of Payments Statistics published on 
December 19, 2008, it was announced with the press release on the same day that 
the studies had been in progress about the Net Errors and Omissions item.  
 As a result of these studies, it appears that some noteworthy developments, 
which took place in October 2008 and are explained below, had important effects on 
the net errors and omissions item.  
  Transactions carried out through Turkish lira currency with non- residents and 
subject to the balance of payments statistics are followed with the changes in the resident Banksâ€™ related Turkish lira accounts with respect to previous month and for 
calculations of US Dollar equivalent of these transactions, average foreign exchange 
buying rate announced by the Central Bank of Turkey is used.  
 In October 2008, the change of foreign exc hange value of New Turkish Lira 
against US Dollar was in the direction of continuous and significant depreciation. As a 
result, the calculated value of the change in US Dollar equivalent of New Turkish Lira 
accounts by using average foreign exchange rate and converting US Dollar 
equivalent of corresponding foreign exchange accounts with foreign exchange rate 
prevailing at the time of the transaction causes discrepancy between US Dollar 
equivalents of the corresponding records of the same transaction because of 
applying different foreign exchange rates.  
 It was observed that there was a substantial increase in volume of sales of 
foreign currency from foreign exchange saving accounts of residents to banks, opened with the funds transferred from saving account s abroad, which are not 
recorded in Turkish balance of payments.  
 Compared with previous periods, there was a significant increase in sales of 
foreign exchange cash, from savings, which are held outside of the banking system by residents, to resident bank s in exchange for New Turkish Lira.  
  The exact quantities of the above- mentioned factors that constitute much of 
the net errors and omission item in October 2008 balance of payments statistics is 
not possible. In conclusion, as no error has been detected in other balance of 
payments items, there will not be any revision in the net errors and omission item of October 2008 balance of payments.
