Press Release on the Maximum Interest Rates for Credit Cards
in Q1 2017
Taking into consideration the recent economic developments and market conditions,
the calculation method of maximum interest rates for credit card borrowings has
been changed. According to the new method, maximum interest rates for credit card
borrowings will be determined by taking into account interest rates of consumer
loans as well as additional risks and costs of credit cards.
Accordingly, the monthly maximum interest rates that banks can charge on Turkish
lira and foreign exchange credit card borrowing have been decreased. To be effective
from 1 January 2017, for the credit card borrowings, the monthly maximum
contractual interest rate will be 1.84 percent for the Turkish lira and 1.47 percent for
foreign exchange transactions, whereas the monthly maximum overdue interest rate
will be 2.34 percent for the Turkish lira and 1.97 percent for foreign exchange
transactions.
Banks are not allowed to charge higher interest rates than the rates announced by
the CBRT for credit cards. Banks are free to determine their respective rates at their
own discretion provided that they are below these ceilings. The maximum
contractual and overdue interest rates for credit card transactions for the threemonth period starting on 1 April 2017 will be announced by the CBRT prior to that
date.
Banks in Turkey, as is the case in other countries, charge higher interest rates for
credit card borrowing than they do for consumer loans. The CBRT therefore advises
credit card holders with short-term credit needs to seek a consumer loan rather than
borrowing on personal credit cards.
