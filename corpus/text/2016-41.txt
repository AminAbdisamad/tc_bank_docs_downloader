SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 22 September 2016

Inflation Developments
1. In August, consumer prices decreased by 0.29 percent, and annual consumer
inflation went down by 0.74 points to 8.05 percent. As stated in the Summary of the
Monetary Policy Committee Meeting of August, this fall was driven by the correction
in the unprocessed food prices. Prices of tobacco products, on the other hand,
manifested the dragged effect of the July correction in August. In this period, core
indicators saw a decline in annual inflation, but a slight increase in underlying trends
driven by core goods.
2. Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages tumbled down to 6.19 percent
due mainly to the decline in the prices of fresh fruits and vegetables. Meanwhile,
inflation in food items excluding fresh fruits and vegetables has exhibited a
favorable course lately. Leading indicators regarding September hint at a prolonged
downward correction in unprocessed food inflation. On the energy front, prices
declined on account of the falling fuel prices. Annual energy inflation climbed to
2.97 percent due to the base effect. In September, lump-sum SCT applied to fuel
products was raised, which is expected to have direct effect on consumer inflation
by 0.3 points.
3. Prices of services increased by 0.71 percent, and the annual services inflation fell by
0.46 points to 8.09 percent in August. Annual inflation decreased in all sub-groups
except rents in this period. The fall in annual inflation was driven by the favorable
course of food prices in addition to the inflation in the prices of restaurant-hotel
services that lost pace due to the base effect. The surge in unit labor costs in the
first half of the year played a significant role in the high course of services inflation,
while the slowdown in the tourism sector restricts these effects to some extent. In
this respect, the underlying trend of services inflation exhibits a limited
deceleration.

4. Annual core goods inflation fell by 0.15 points to 8.67 percent in August. Annual
inflation crept up in durable goods, but decreased in other groups. Lagged effects of
the exchange rate on annual core goods inflation display a gradual decline.
However, following the July depreciation in the Turkish lira, the underlying trend in
core goods exhibited a slight increase in this period.
5. In sum, the slowdown in aggregate demand contributes to the gradual fall in core
inflation. With the help of falling food prices, headline inflation is expected to
display a decline in the short term. However, the recent tax adjustment in fuel prices
and other cost factors limit the improvement in inflation.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6. Second-quarter TurkStat data indicate that the GDP grew by an annual 3.1 percent.
Adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects, growth has lost some momentum in the
second quarter, up only by 0.3 percent after seeing a modest 0.7 percent increase in
the first quarter. Investments remained sluggish while private and public spending
provided a major boost to growth. The spillovers of the tourism slump became more
pervasive in the second quarter, causing net exports to have a heightened negative
impact on growth.
7. Recent data releases and indicators for the third quarter point to a deceleration in
economic activity. Calendar and seasonally-adjusted industrial production dipped
both monthly and annually due to the domestic turbulence of July and the extended
Ramadan holiday. This plunge is in part attributed to both the loss of working days
caused by this holiday extension (bridge-day effects) and the drop in effective
working days following July 15. In fact, recent indicators suggest that the recovery in
August and September partly compensated for July’s output loss. Nevertheless,
third-quarter industrial production is expected to be lower than in the second
quarter.
8. The increased EU demand continues to foster exports. Despite geopolitically-driven
negative effects on external demand, Turkey’s flexibility in market diversification
remains supportive of exports. Recent data on external trade signal that non-gold
exports were up in August, offsetting the July descent. Yet, spillovers from the
troubled tourism industry into net exports were more pronounced in the summer
months. The tourism slump is likely to have a short-lived negative impact on the
current account balance, but the lagged pass-through of terms-of-trade
developments and the moderate course of consumer loans help to improve the
current account balance. Meanwhile, commodity prices are expected to become
gradually less accommodative for the current account deficit in the coming months.
9. In June, seasonally-adjusted unemployment rates were up month-on-month due to
narrowing non-farm employment. Thus, with the deteriorating employment
outlook, unemployment rates jumped for the second month in a row. The
employment decline spread across all industries. Industrial and construction

employment dropped while services employment saw a weakening growth. In light
of actual data and leading indicators, unemployment rates are anticipated to surge
in the third quarter. Moreover, the SSI data indicate that the stagnant tourism
industry continues to weigh on services employment as of June.
10. In sum, economic activity is expected to post a quarterly fall in the third quarter.
However, it is envisaged that the negative impact of the downturn in tourism on
growth will be more restricted and domestic demand will start to recover on the
back of accommodative incentives and measures.
Monetary Policy and Risks
11. The Committee assesses that current financial conditions are tight. The rise in global
risk appetite helps to ease financial conditions, but loan standards remain tight. The
gradual fall in the marginal funding rate partly passed through into loan and deposit
rates. Loans are likely to see a moderate recovery over the upcoming period with
the support coming from accommodative macroprudential measures.
12. Recently released data and indicators regarding the third quarter display a
deceleration in the economic activity. Unemployment rates which have been on the
rise for the second consecutive month due to the worsening employment outlook
confirm the economic slowdown. However, leading indicators imply that the
significant slowdown in industrial production observed in July is not permanent.
Despite the adverse effects of geopolitical developments on external demand,
exports of goods to EU members remain strong. Restored relations with Russia may
also support external demand gradually. Accordingly, exports of goods are expected
to provide further contributions to growth in the upcoming period. Domestic
demand is likely to start recovering by the fourth quarter on account of
accommodative incentives and measures.
13. In terms of global economic developments, low levels of advanced economy interest
rates and commodity prices continue to affect the Turkish economy favorably.
Although the uncertainty over global monetary policies have somewhat heightened,
emerging economies continue to attract portfolio inflows.
14. In light of these developments and considering its contribution to the effectiveness
of monetary policy, the Committee decided to take a measured and prudent step
towards simplification. The ultimate aim of simplification is to achieve a narrow and
symmetrical corridor and provide funding via a single rate. The simplification of the
monetary policy is planned to be finalized within a reasonable schedule. The pace
and timing of simplification will depend on the developments regarding inflation
and financial stability.
15. Inflation was down in August owing to improving indicators for unprocessed food
and core inflation. The lagged effects of cumulative exchange rate movements on
annual inflation eased further. However, the implications of the Turkish lira’s July
depreciation for core goods and the pressures from unit labor costs and rigidities on

services caused the underlying core inflation to remain high. In spite of gains from
lower imported-input costs, the underlying inflation improved only marginally. For
the upcoming period, the slowing aggregate demand may contribute to the gradual
decline in core inflation while falling food prices are expected to pull inflation down
in the short term. Nevertheless, adjustments in fuel taxes and other cost-related
developments put upward pressure on inflation and require the maintenance of a
cautious monetary policy stance.
16. In the upcoming period, the monetary policy stance will be conditional on the
inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, the pricing behavior
and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the cautious monetary policy
stance will be maintained.
17. Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with
regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance
is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and
there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices. A revision of the
monetary policy stance may be considered should the fiscal policy deviate
significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the
medium-term inflation outlook.
18. Sustained fiscal discipline has become essential in reducing the sensitivity of the
Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years. In the current environment
of highly uncertain global markets, the gains from maintaining and further
advancing these achievements are significant. Any measure to provide permanent
fiscal discipline and reduction in the savings deficit will support macroeconomic
stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of longterm government securities at low levels.
