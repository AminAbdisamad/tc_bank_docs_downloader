With the increase in FX reserve requirement ratios, liquidity amounting to
approximately USD 1 billion will be withdrawn from the market and the effective
reserve requirement ratio for FX currently standing at 11.5 percent will become 11.9
percent.
Besides, in the context of the facility that allows banks to hold Turkish lira
required reserves in FX, one more tranche has been added to the existing tranches
by keeping the upper limit unchanged, and the reserve option coefficients (ROCs)
have been raised by 0.1 points for all tranches excluding the first tranche.
Accordingly, the revised ROCs are as follows:

FX Facility Tranches
(%)
0-30
30-35
35-40
40-45
45-50
50-55
55-60

Banks have been consistently using the facility of holding Turkish lira required
reserves in FX and the utilization ratio is 84.1 percent (50.5/60). At present, FX worth
USD 30.9 billion is being held for Turkish lira required reserves. Should the facility
continue to be used at the same level after the revisions, Central Bank FX reserves
are expected to increase approximately by USD 0.8 billion.
The revisions will be effective as of the calculation period dated 24 May 2013
and the maintenance period will begin on 7 June 2013.
