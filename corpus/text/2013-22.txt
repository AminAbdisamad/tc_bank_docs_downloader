With the increase in FX reserve requirement ratios,  liquidity amounting to 
approximately USD 1 billion will be withdrawn from the market and the effective 
reserve requirement ratio for FX currently standing  at 11.5 percent will become 11.9 
percent. 
Besides, in the context of the facility that allows  banks to hold Turkish lira 
required reserves in FX, one more tranche has been added to the existing tranches 
by keeping the upper limit unchanged, and the reser ve option coefficients (ROCs) 
have been raised by 0.1 points for all tranches exc luding the first tranche. 
Accordingly, the revised ROCs are as follows: 
 FX Facility Tranches 
(%) Current 
ROC New  
ROC 
0-30 1.4 1.4 
30-35 1.5 
35-40 1.7 1.8 
40-45 2.1 2.2 
45-50 2.4 2.5 
50-55 2.6 2.7 
55-60 2.7 2.8 
 
Banks have been consistently using the facility of holding Turkish lira required 
reserves in FX and the utilization ratio is 84.1 pe rcent (50.5/60). At present, FX worth 
USD 30.9 billion is being held for Turkish lira req uired reserves. Should the facility 
continue to be used at the same level after the rev isions, Central Bank FX reserves 
are expected to increase approximately by USD 0.8 b illion. 
The revisions will be effective as of the calculati on period dated 24 May 2013 
and the maintenance period will begin on 7 June 201 3.
