SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: March 18, 2010

Inflation Developments
1. Consumer prices increased by 1.45 percent in February, pushing annual
inflation up by 1.94 percentage points to 10.13 percent. As noted in February’s
Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) Meeting Summary, the recent
rise in annual inflation was driven by temporary factors such as soaring
unprocessed food prices, lagged impacts of tax adjustments, and base effects.
In fact, core inflation indicators have continued to hover at low levels,
notwithstanding the rise in annual inflation.
2. The steep increase in vegetable prices due to adverse weather conditions and
the ongoing surge in meat prices pushed annual unprocessed food inflation up
by about 10 percentage points in February. Nonetheless, there may be a
correction in vegetable prices during March.
3. Besides the developments in unprocessed food items, price hikes in energy
and tobacco also put upward pressure on inflation. Energy prices continued to
increase in February on the back of higher bottled gas and auto LPG prices.
Annual energy inflation is expected to rise further in coming months owing to
base effects. Meanwhile, tobacco inflation continued to accelerate due to the
spillover of January’s tax changes.
4. By contrast, weak aggregate demand has dampened the pass-through of price
hikes in food, energy and tobacco into overall pricing trends. The endFebruary annual inflation across core goods (excluding food, energy, alcoholic
beverages, tobacco and gold) was a modest 2.17 percent. The low level of
inflation in core goods was particularly driven by durable good items.
5. The impact of higher food and energy prices on catering and transport
services became more significant, while prices of other services continued to
rise at a slower pace. The Committee noted that, although seasonally adjusted
services inflation has been rising modestly for a while, underlying services
inflation is consistent with the medium-term targets. Nevertheless, Committee
members emphasized that overall pricing behavior needs to be closely
monitored.

Factors Affecting Inflation
6. Recent data releases suggest that a moderate recovery in economic activity is
ongoing. Industrial production grew by 12.1 percent year-on-year in January,
which is equivalent to 16.1 percent in calendar adjusted terms. The seasonally
adjusted industrial production index was up 0.3 percent month-on-month,
pointing to ongoing yet slower growth. Leading indicators suggest that
industrial production has continued to recover in February and March.
7. Domestic demand is following a gradual growth trend. The recent growth in
labor compensation and favorable developments across credit markets are
supporting the recovery in private consumption. Production and imports data
indicate that private consumption demand increased moderately during the
final quarter of 2009. Moreover, releases on consumer goods production in
January signal an ongoing recovery in private consumption demand. In
addition, new order indices in the PMI show that the recovery in private
consumption demand continued into the first quarter, albeit at a slower pace,
which is also supported by the flattening of consumer confidence indices.
8. Production and imports data for capital goods suggest that the recovery in
private investment demand has yet to gain momentum. Indicators of resource
utilization, such as capacity utilization in the manufacturing industry and hours
worked per capita, remain weak, while manufacturing firms continue to view
their production capacity as “more than sufficient”, considering their current
order books and demand expectations. Investment demand is expected to
continue to grow moderately in the upcoming period. Yet, insufficient and
uncertain aggregate demand is likely to restrain new investments in the
manufacturing industry, given the weak global growth outlook. Accordingly, the
Committee expects investment demand to remain below pre-crisis levels for a
while.
9. Uncertainty regarding foreign demand remains. The Committee emphasized
that the outlook for existing export markets, particularly the euro area, remains
weak, and reiterated that the recovery in exports would be gradual, which is
demonstrated by the recent trends in leading indicators for exports. Thus, it
will take a while before industrial capacity utilization rates return to pre-crisis
levels.
10. Although employment conditions continue to improve, unemployment rates
remain at high levels. Seasonally adjusted data for December indicate that
non-farm employment continues to recover. Weak foreign demand continued
to restrain industrial employment, while the recovery in construction and
services sectors helped non-farm employment return to pre-crisis levels.

11. Overall, recent data releases suggest that the economic recovery is ongoing.
The lagged effects of monetary policy actions on domestic demand have
become more pronounced, while the weak outlook for global growth continues
to dampen resource utilization in tradable sectors. Overall, the Committee
continues to expect the economic recovery to be gradual.
Monetary Policy and Risks
12. Monetary policy decisions are based on the medium-term outlook for inflation,
rather than temporary price developments. However, the Committee members
indicated that, for the purpose of managing expectations, it might be useful to
inform economic agents about the likely path of inflation in the short term,
given that inflation currently hovers significantly above the target.
13. With the partial correction in unprocessed food prices, the Committee
members expect inflation to drop to single digit levels in March. However, the
Committee indicated that inflation would display fluctuations in 2010 owing to
the base effects driven by the temporary tax cuts and volatile unprocessed
food prices during 2009. Temporary tax cuts implemented in March 2009,
which were withdrawn partly in June and fully in October, would lead to rising
inflation rates during March and April, and a decrease in inflation rates during
June and October of 2010. Moreover, unprocessed food inflation registered a
historically high print in the last quarter of 2009, following a historical low
during the third quarter. These strong base effects would likely lead to
fluctuations in headline inflation throughout 2010, therefore making it difficult to
assess underlying trend inflation. In this respect, the Committee underscored
that economic agents should closely monitor the Central Bank’s reports and
statements regarding inflation developments.
14. The Committee stated that the impact of the sharp increases in unprocessed
food prices during the last quarter of 2009 would ease in the final quarter of
2010. Likewise, the 1.9 percentage point impact of the recent tax hikes on
inflation would dissipate during the January-February period of 2011.
Accordingly, inflation would continue to hover significantly above target for
some time, however, it would then revert to a downward trend as the
temporary factors taper off starting in the last quarter of the year, and decline
to levels consistent with inflation targets by early 2011.
15. Core inflation indicators would increase in the short term as well, especially
during March and April, owing to the base effects driven by the temporary tax
cuts of the previous year. However, in line with the modest recovery in
aggregate demand conditions, core inflation indicators would continue to
remain below the target.

16. Increasing headline inflation is having an adverse impact on inflation
expectations. The current state of aggregate demand conditions is expected to
dampen the pass-through of the rise in unprocessed food and administered
prices on overall prices. Still, the Committee members underscored the
importance of closely monitoring price setting behavior, given that Turkey has
had to cope with high levels of inflation in the past.
17. Credit markets have continued to improve in response to the monetary easing.
Committee members noted that easing financial conditions have been
strengthening the expansionary impact of monetary policy. Commercial loans
have recovered significantly in the first two months of the year, while the
recovery in consumer loans has been relatively more moderate. The
Committee indicated that lagged impacts of the monetary easing would
continue to support the credit markets, yet high levels of unemployment rates
and relatively tight external financing conditions would restrain credit growth.
18. The global economy continues to recover. However, the high levels of budget
deficits on a global scale and ongoing problems in credit and real estate
markets continue to pose downside risks on global activity, particularly in
developed economies.
19. Overall, despite recent improvements, there are still lingering problems across
the global economy. Accordingly, the Committee has reiterated that it would
be necessary to keep policy rates at low levels for a long period of time.
However, the CBT will not hesitate to tighten monetary policy sooner than
envisaged in the baseline scenario of the Inflation Report, should the recent
increase in inflation expectations lead to a deterioration in price setting
behavior.
20. Increasing budget deficits on a worldwide scale, particularly across developed
economies, continue to pose risks on inflation expectations and thus on
longer-term global interest rates. In fact, recently, long-term interest rates
across developed economies have been displaying significant increases.
Countries with relatively sounder banking systems and prudent fiscal policies
would be more resilient against such risks. In this respect, the Committee will
continue to monitor fiscal policy developments closely while formulating
monetary policy. Should the goals set out in the Medium Term Program be
implemented through institutional and structural improvements, rather than tax
and administered price hikes, it would be possible to keep policy rates at
single digit levels over the medium term.
21. Since the last quarter of 2008, the CBT, without prejudice to its primary
objective of price stability, has focused on containing the adverse effects of the
global crisis on the domestic economy—which has been achieved to a large
extent. Monetary policy will continue to focus on price stability in the period

ahead. Strengthening the commitment to fiscal discipline and the structural
reform agenda would support the improvement of Turkey’s sovereign risk, and
thus facilitate macroeconomic and price stability. In this respect, timely
implementation of the structural reforms envisaged by the Medium Term
Program and the European Union accession process remains to be of utmost
importance.
