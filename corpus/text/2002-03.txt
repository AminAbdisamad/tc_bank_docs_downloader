PRESS RELEASE  
End of year balance sheet targets of the Central Bank (CB), as were determined by letter of intend 
(loi) dated November 20, 2001, have been met. The detaÄ±ls of these targets and their realisations 
are as follows:  
 
1) As indicated in loi, Net Domestic Assets (NDA) was converted into Turkish Lira (TRL) at 
end-July 2001 exchange rates for the period November -December. The NDA average of last 
five working days of December was realised as 19.493 billion TRL , which was below the 
indicative ceiling set at 22.400 billion TRL.  
2) In the loi the limits on the changes in Net International Reserves (NIR) was set as 600 million 
US dollars (USD), however, the unused portion of September -October period was transferred 
to November -December period. Within this framework, since only 304 mio USD portion of 
the limit on the changes in NIR, which was 3.250 mio USD, was used during September -
October period, the unused portion of 2.946 mio USD was transferred to November -
December  period, therefore, the limits on the changes in NIR for the period November -
December raised to 3.546 mio USD.  
The decline in NIR during November -December was realised as 1.730 mio USD which 
was below the performance criteria set as 3.546 mio USD.
