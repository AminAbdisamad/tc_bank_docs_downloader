SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: August 23, 2011

Inflation Developments
1. Consumer prices went down by 0.41 percent in July, whereas annual inflation
edged up to 6.31 percent as envisaged in the July Inflation Report. Core
goods (excluding food, energy, alcoholic beverages, tobacco and gold)
inflation remained flat in this period, while the services inflation went up.
Therefore, core inflation indicators continued to increase.
2. Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages declined to 7.65 percent.
Despite the rise in vegetable and meat prices, unprocessed food prices
decreased by 3.65 percent amid the decline in fruit prices. On the processed
food front, prices of bread, cereals and processed meat went up. Moreover,
the rising trend in prices of fats and oils continued, and sugar prices posted an
increase. Accordingly, annual processed food inflation rose to 8.25 percent.
The uptrend in processed food prices is expected to continue in August as
well.
3. Prices of services were up 0.74 percent, while annual services inflation
increased to 5.39 percent. Prices of transport services continued to increase
due to higher fuel prices and are expected to remain on the rise over the
forthcoming period. While rents maintained their moderate increase, prices of
tour packages soared. Consequently, the underlying trend of services inflation
posted a limited increase.
4. The recent upward trend in annual core goods inflation halted in July. Annual
inflation maintained its uptrend in clothing but went down in durable goods
(excluding gold). On a month-on-month basis, furniture prices increased,
whereas prices of white goods declined. Meanwhile, the Monetary Policy
Committee (the Committee) has noted that core goods inflation may increase
temporarily in the short term due to exchange rate pass-through.
5. Although annual core inflation indicators continued to increase in July,
seasonally adjusted monthly data pointed a decline in the recent underlying
trend. Yet, due to exchange rate pass-through, core inflation is expected to
increase slightly in August.

Factors Affecting Inflation
6. Recent data releases confirm the Committee’s assessment that global
economic activity continues to decelerate. Accordingly, external demand
remains weak. Core euro area economies grew at a slower-than-expected
pace in the second quarter and July’s PMI data point to a worsening outlook.
In addition, short and medium-term US growth forecasts of various institutions
have been revised downward. The Committee has stated that the global
growth outlook is deteriorating amid recent developments in August. The
Committee members have noted that, despite the competitiveness gains due
to the recent exchange rate movements, global developments would continue
to restrain external demand.
7. Signals of a slowdown in economic activity are growing stronger. Seasonally
adjusted industrial production data posted a month-on-month decrease of 0.9
percent in June, recording a decline for five consecutive months. The
slowdown in capacity utilization since February became more evident in July,
leading to a cumulative decline of about 4 percentage points compared to
January. July data on the expectations for new orders, which serve as a
leading indicator, signals that manufacturing activity might remain weak in the
third quarter as well.
8. There is an ongoing slowdown in final domestic demand since the second
quarter. Leading indicators for August suggest that the ongoing weakening in
consumer confidence has become more pronounced. Moreover, investment
appetite has decelerated for the first time in a long while. Domestic sales of
automobiles and light commercial vehicles, which remained below the
previous quarter’s average in July, are expected to decrease further amid the
weakening Turkish lira. All these developments signal that the slowdown in
domestic demand may deepen.
9. The unemployment rate hovers around pre-crisis levels. Yet, due to the
decline in industrial employment in May, non-farm employment growth slowed
and unemployment rates posted a slight quarter-on-quarter increase in
seasonally adjusted terms. Leading indicators suggest that this slowdown in
employment would continue in the third quarter as well.

Monetary Policy and Risks
10. The Committee has noted that inflation may temporarily hover slightly above
the levels envisaged in the July Inflation Report and core inflation may
continue to rise for some time. However, due to the slowdown in the economic

activity, it is expected that the second round effects of exchange rate
movements would be limited, and thus the increase in inflation would be
temporary. Core inflation indicators are expected to start falling again by the
end of the year. Moreover, inflation outlook for the end of 2012 is seen
consistent with the 5 percent target.
11. According to the Committee, in an environment of increasingly slowing
economic activity and ongoing macro financial risks, it would not be an optimal
response to react to temporary price movements. However, it was stated that
it is important to monitor inflation expectations closely and take the necessary
measures if there is a deterioration in the pricing behavior that may hamper
the attainment of medium term targets.
12. The slowdown in credit growth and domestic demand combined with the
exchange rate movements have been contributing to the rebalancing of
domestic and external demand. Credit growth continues to slow down across
all subcategories, with the deceleration in general purpose consumer loans
being more pronounced. Moreover, cumulative movements in the exchange
rate would put a significant restraint on the import demand in the second half
of the year. Accordingly, the Committee expects a notable improvement in the
current account balance in the forthcoming period. It was reiterated that
monitoring the seasonally adjusted monthly data is more informative in
assessing the underlying trend of the current account balance. Still, the
Committee members have highlighted the important role of structural
measures that would boost productivity and increase the saving rate, in order
to stabilize the current account deficit at reasonable levels in the medium to
long term.
13. The Committee has agreed that the measures taken at the interim meeting on
August 4, 2011 have contained the downside risks for the economy for the
time being, and thus decided to keep the policy instruments unchanged at this
meeting. However, given the uncertainties regarding the global economy, it is
important to monitor all developments closely, and to deliver the required
policy response in a timely manner. The Committee has also reiterated that all
policy instruments may be eased should global economic problems further
intensify and the slowdown in domestic economic activity becomes more
pronounced.
14. Monetary policy will continue to focus on price stability while preserving
financial stability as a supplementary objective. To this end, the impact of the
macroprudential measures taken by the Central Bank and other institutions on
the inflation outlook will be assessed carefully. Strengthening the commitment
to fiscal discipline and the structural reform agenda in the medium term would
support the relative improvement of Turkey's sovereign risk, and thus facilitate

macroeconomic and price stability. Sustaining the fiscal discipline will also
provide more flexibility for monetary policy and support the social welfare by
keeping interest rates permanently at low levels. Therefore, addressing these
issues in the new Medium Term Program and progressing with the structural
reforms envisaged by the European Union acquis communautaire remains of
utmost importance.
