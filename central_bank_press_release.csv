Press Release on Macroprudential Measures
As a result of the Liraization Strategy implemented by the Central Bank, banks in general have reached the 50% liraization target in deposits announced for 2022. In its Monetary Policy and Liraization Strategy for 2023, the CBRT shared with the public that the liraization target in deposits for the first half of 2023 was set at 60%. 
Accordingly, the following changes have been made in the securities maintenance practice effective from 24 February 2023. 

1. The securities maintenance ratio has been raised to 10% from 5%. 
2. Banks that exceed the 60% Turkish lira share target in real and legal person deposits will be subject to a discounted securities maintenance ratio. Accordingly, the banks, of which the lower of these shares for real and legal person is:
a. between 60% (included) and 70%, will get a 5-point discount, and
b. above 70%, will get a 7-point discount 
on the securities maintenance ratio. 
3. For banks with Turkish lira shares below the 60% target, the previously determined additional ratios will continue to be applied by adding them to the securities maintenance ratio.

Press Release on Macroprudential Measures
In its Monetary Policy and Liraization Strategy for 2023 document, the CBRT stated that policies to be implemented under the Liraization strategy would continue to be used in a strengthened manner to permanently increase the weight of the Turkish lira (TL) in both assets and liabilities of the banking system. Moreover, the Bank announced that by considering incentives mainly for TL deposits not included in the FX-protected deposits (KKM), further steps would be taken to invigorate the attraction of TL deposits.
In this context, to encourage maturity extension of TL deposits, the CBRT has decided to set reserve requirement ratios for TL deposit accounts with maturities longer than three months at zero percent.
Additionally, it has been decided to set reserve requirement ratios at zero percent for the increase in FX liabilities with maturities longer than 6 months provided directly from abroad until the end of 2023. 
These changes will be effective from the calculation date of 20 January 2023 with the maintenance period starting on 3 February 2023.

Press Release on Interest Rates

Şahap Kavcıoğlu (Governor), Taha Çakmak, Mustafa Duman, Elif Haykır Hobikoğlu, Emrah Şener.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 9 percent.
Although recently released data point to a stronger economic activity than anticipated, recession concerns in developed economies as a result of ongoing geopolitical risks and interest rate hikes continue. While the negative consequences of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly basic food, have been alleviated by the strategic solutions facilitated by Türkiye, the high level in producer and consumer inflation continues on an international scale. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. The divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies continue to increase due to their diverse economic outlook. It is observed that central banks continue their efforts to develop new supportive measures and tools to cope with the increasing uncertainties in financial markets. Additionally, financial markets started to adjust their expectations that the central banks would end the rate hike cycles in the near term on the back of the increasing recession risks.
A strong growth was observed in the first three quarters of 2022. Indicators for the last quarter of the year show that a slowdown in growth due to the weakening foreign demand is compensated by the relatively strong course in domestic demand. The effects of foreign demand-based pressures observed in the manufacturing industry on domestic demand and supply capacity currently remain limited. Compared to peer economies, job creation has been stronger. Considering the sectors that contribute to the employment increase, it is observed that the growth dynamics are supported by structural gains. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, the stronger than expected contribution of tourism revenues to the current account balance continues throughout the year. On the other hand, domestic consumption demand, high level of energy prices and the likelihood of a recession in main trade partners keep the risks on current account balance alive. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability. The rate of credit growth and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes are closely monitored. As announced in the 2023 Monetary Policy and Liraization Strategy document, the Committee will continue to decisively use the tools supporting the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism and the entire policy toolset, particularly funding channels, will be aligned with liraization targets.
Level and underlying trend of inflation have been improved with the support of the integrated policy approach implemented to strengthen sustainable price stability and financial stability. The effects of slowing foreign demand on aggregate demand conditions and production are closely monitored. It is critically important that financial conditions remain supportive for the sustainability of structural gains in supply and investment capacity by preserving the growth momentum in industrial production and the positive trend in employment in a period of increasing uncertainties regarding global growth as well as further escalation of geopolitical risks. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged.
The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. The CBRT will implement Liraization Strategy in order to create an institutional basis for permanent and sustainable price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.
The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

Press Release on Supporting Conversion of Firms’ Foreign Exchange Obtained From Abroad Into Turkish Liras
As part of its Monetary Policy and Liraization Strategy for 2023, the Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye (CBRT) has decided to provide support for the conversion of firms’ foreign exchange (FX) obtained from abroad into Turkish liras to support liraization in commercial activities.
Accordingly,

When selling their FX obtained from abroad to the CBRT, firms will be provided with a FX conversion support corresponding to 2% of the amount converted into Turkish liras, in return for their pledge.
After firms sell at least 40% of the FX they have brought into the country from abroad to the CBRT, they will be able to deposit the remaining part of the FX they brought from abroad into FX-protected conversion accounts, and in return for their pledge, firms will be provided with a FX conversion support of 2% of the amount converted into Turkish liras.

Banks will be in charge of confirming that the FX sold to the CBRT and FX to be converted into Turkish lira deposit and participation accounts have been obtained from abroad.

26 January 2023
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting 
Meeting Date: 19 January 2023
Inflation Developments
1.    Consumer prices rose by 1.18%, and annual inflation decreased by 20.12 points to 64.27% in December. Mild price movements pulled annual inflation down across all subgroups, while core goods and food groups became the main contributors of this fall. Annual inflation decreased across all subgroups of core goods, with durable goods in the lead. Prices in the energy group registered a decline due mainly to the fall in fuel prices. Price increases in the food group remained more limited compared to previous months due to the correction in the prices of fresh fruits and vegetables. Producer prices declined due to tumbling prices in petroleum and petroleum products as well as electricity and natural gas, while, sectors excluding energy recorded mild price increases. The fall in headline producer prices led to a sustained decline in annual producer inflation. Against this background, according to the seasonally adjusted data, the slowdown in monthly change in the B index continued, while the C index crept up, and annual inflation of both indices decreased significantly.
2.    Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages fell by 24.68 points to 77.87%. Annual inflation fell by 23.99 points to 73.25% in unprocessed food, and by 25.35 points to 82.00% in processed food, respectively. Seasonally-adjusted data for the unprocessed food group points to a decline in the prices of fresh fruits and vegetables in December, with a more pronounced fall in vegetable prices. In the other unprocessed food subgroup, price hikes in red meat as well as rice and potato stood out. In the unprocessed food group, monthly price increases decelerated to 2.23%. The bread and cereals item recorded further increases in December, while fats and oils as well as canned vegetables in the other processed food group exhibited high price increases. 
3.    Energy prices decreased by 2.12% in December, and annual inflation in this group dropped by 23.57 points to 94.43%. Despite the hike in municipal water prices, energy prices fell in this period due to tumbling fuel prices in tandem with the decline in international crude oil prices. 
4.    Services prices rose by 1.85% in December, and the group’s annual inflation decreased by 5.23 points to 55.49%. Annual inflation dropped significantly in restaurants-hotels, transport and other services, while it increased in rents and communication. Seasonally-adjusted data suggest that the monthly increase in the rent subgroup remained almost flat, but annual rent inflation increased further. Prices in the restaurants-hotels subgroup were up by 2.61% in December, driven by catering services due to the recent developments in food prices. Prices in the other services subgroup climbed by 1.65%, due to maintenance and repair, health, and recreational and cultural services. The positive outlook for fuel prices was mirrored in transport services, and prices in this subgroup declined by 0.52%.   
5.    Annual inflation in core goods dropped by 27.15 points to 48.96%. Annual inflation decreased across subgroups, more markedly in durable goods. In durable goods, the tax base adjustment led to a decrease in automobile prices, while the ongoing upward trend in white goods and furniture prices pushed the prices in this subgroup up by 1.88%. Medicine prices increased due to the revision of the reference euro exchange rate, and accelerated other core goods inflation (3.56%). Prices of clothing and footwear fell by 1.46%, pulling annual inflation down by 25.01%, and continued to affect annual core goods inflation favorably.
6.    The January results of the Survey of Market Participants suggested that inflation expectations decreased further. The 12-month ahead inflation expectation was down by 4.48 points to 30.44%, and the 24-month ahead inflation expectation was down by 3.38 points to 17.18%. Meanwhile, the five-year ahead expectation was revised down by 0.44 points to 8.67%.
Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks
7.    Although recently released data point to a stronger economic activity than anticipated, recession concerns in developed economies as a result of ongoing geopolitical risks and interest rate hikes continue.
8.    While the negative consequences of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly basic food, have been alleviated by the strategic solutions facilitated by Türkiye, the high level in producer and consumer inflation continues on an international scale. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored.
9.    The divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies continue to increase due to their diverse economic outlook. It is observed that central banks continue their efforts to develop new supportive measures and tools to cope with the increasing uncertainties in financial markets. Additionally, financial markets started to adjust their expectations that the central banks would end the rate hike cycles in the near term on the back of the increasing recession risks.
10.    Regarding portfolio flows to emerging economies, bond and equity markets saw inflows in January parallel to the improved global risk appetite. On the other hand, the volatility in the long-term bond yields in advanced economies and the course of global financial conditions keep the risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies alive.
11.    The favorable outlook in international commodity prices prevailing in the second half of 2022 continued into December, and price decreases were registered in subgroups excluding industrial metal. Although crude oil prices assumed an upward trend as of mid-December due to the easing of lockdown measures in China, their January average remains close to the December average. The fall in natural gas prices observed in December became more evident in January on the back of mild winter conditions. The deceleration in global demand conditions also triggered a decline in international transportation costs. The mild course in exchange rates was maintained in December. Against this background, producer prices decreased by 0.24% in December, led by energy items. Following the monthly decline in producer prices, annual producer inflation dropped by 38.30 points to 97.72%. Across main industrial groupings, annual inflation decreased in all subgroups, most notably in energy. An analysis of monthly price developments by sectors indicates that prices of refined petroleum products as well as electricity and natural gas production declined whereas price increases continued in sectors other than energy.
12.    The level and underlying trend of inflation have been improved with the support of the integrated policy approach implemented to strengthen sustainable price stability and financial stability. The effects of slowing foreign demand on aggregate demand conditions and production are closely monitored.
13.    A strong growth was observed in the first three quarters of 2022. Indicators for the last quarter of the year show that a slowdown in growth due to the weakening foreign demand is compensated for by the relatively strong course in domestic demand. In November, industrial production declined by 1.1%, adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects, on a monthly basis and it decreased by 1.2% on an annual basis. However, when sectors typically exhibiting high volatility such as other transport that posted a strong increase in the previous month are excluded, the monthly decline in manufacturing industry production was more limited at 0.9%. An analysis of production developments with respect to export share suggests that the fall in industrial production in November was stronger in sectors with high export intensity. On a quarterly basis, the rise in industrial production in the fourth quarter was 1.9% as of November, while it remained limited at 0.5% when typically volatile sectors were excluded.
14.    The effects of foreign demand-based pressures observed in the manufacturing industry on domestic demand and supply capacity currently remain limited. Manufacturing industry firms’ registered domestic and external orders and future order expectations reveal that the weak course in export order expectations continued in the last quarter, while domestic market order expectations increased. In this context, despite the continued weakening in external demand, domestic demand followed a relatively stronger course. As a matter of fact, while the retail sales volume index increased by 1.5% on a monthly basis in November, the increase on a quarterly basis reached 4.5%. The uptrend in credit card expenditures also continued in the last quarter. Meanwhile, firms’ investment and employment expectations for the future decreased slightly in the last quarter.
15.    In November, seasonally-adjusted employment increased by 0.9% on a monthly basis and by 1.6% on a quarterly basis. The seasonally adjusted labor force participation rate increased by 0.4 points monthly to 54.1%. In this period, despite the rise in employment, the seasonally-adjusted total unemployment rate remained unchanged compared to the previous month and stayed at 10.2% due to the increase in labor force participation. Survey indicators and high-frequency data indicate that the upward trend in employment is maintained. Compared to peer economies, job creation has been stronger when the post-pandemic period is examined. Considering the sectors that contribute to the employment increase, it is observed that the growth dynamics are supported by structural gains.
16.    The strong course of energy and gold imports still affects the current account balance negatively. While the current account balance posted a deficit of 3.7 billion dollars in November, the annualized current account deficit increased by 1.6 billion dollars to 45 billion dollars. The provisional foreign trade data for December suggest that seasonally adjusted exports and imports increased on a monthly basis. In 2022, exports and imports reached 254.2 billion dollars and 364.4 billion dollars, respectively, while foreign trade deficit realized 110.2 billion dollars, mainly due to the annual increase in gold and energy imports. Despite the increase in the foreign trade deficit led by the surge in commodity prices, mainly energy prices, coupled with the acceleration in gold imports, the ongoing upward trend in services revenues continues to support the current account balance. While the share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, the stronger-than-expected contribution of tourism revenues to the current account balance continues throughout the year. On the other hand, domestic consumption demand, high level of energy prices and the likelihood of a recession in main trade partners keep the risks on current account balance alive. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability.
Monetary Policy
17.    The monetary policy stance will be determined by taking into account the evaluations on the source and permanence of risks, along with the extent to which they can be contained by monetary policy, and with a focus on achieving the sustainable price stability target, in a cautious manner.
18.    In formulating the monetary policy towards achieving the sustainable price stability objective, a liraization-oriented approach will be maintained that also addresses risks to financial stability. The rate of credit growth and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes are closely monitored.
19.    As announced in the 2023 Monetary Policy and Liraization Strategy document, the Committee will continue to decisively use the tools supporting the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism; and the entire policy toolset, particularly funding channels, will be aligned with liraization targets.
20.    It is critically important that financial conditions remain supportive for the sustainability of structural gains in supply and investment capacity by preserving the growth momentum in industrial production and the positive trend in employment in a period of increasing uncertainties regarding global growth as well as further escalation of geopolitical risks. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged.
21.    The CBRT will implement the Liraization Strategy in order to create an institutional basis for permanent and sustainable price stability. The focus of this process will be on developing policy instruments to support the improvement of Turkish lira deposits, to increase Turkish lira-denominated assets in the collateral structure of Open Market Operations funding, to gradually reduce the volume of swaps, and to strengthen foreign exchange reserves.
22.    The rise in the demand for long-term, fixed-income and Turkish lira-denominated assets and the course of the yield curve in tandem with the direction of the efficiency of monetary transmission are closely monitored. Along with credit growth, the Committee will also consider the improvement in financing costs of loans providing efficiency gains in targeted areas so as to maintain the transmission.
23.    Accordingly, the effects of liquidity and distribution developments of the Turkish lira on deposits and loan pricing, the effects of exchange rate developments on inflation, and the impact of the developments regarding FX-protected deposit products on reverse currency substitution, the depth and stability of the foreign exchange market, and price stability are being analyzed, and necessary policy measures are being taken.
24.    The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5% target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. 
25.    Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.
26.    The Committee supports building strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders in order to achieve price stability.
27.    The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework."

Press Release on Interest Rates
Participating Committee Members
Şahap Kavcıoğlu (Governor), Taha Çakmak, Mustafa Duman, Elif Haykır Hobikoğlu, Emrah Şener.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 9 percent to 8.5 percent.
Although recently released data point to a stronger economic activity than anticipated, recession concerns in developed economies as a result of ongoing geopolitical risks and interest rate hikes continue. While the negative consequences of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly basic food, have been alleviated by the strategic solutions facilitated by Türkiye, the high level in producer and consumer inflation continues on an international scale. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. The divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies continue to increase due to their diverse economic outlook. It is observed that central banks continue their efforts to develop new supportive measures and tools to cope with the increasing uncertainties in financial markets. Additionally, financial markets have been adjusting their expectations that the central banks would end the rate hike cycles in the near term on the back of the recession risks.
Before the worst natural disaster of the last century, leading indicators have been pointing to a stronger domestic demand compared to foreign demand as well as an increase in the growth trend in the first quarter of 2023. The impact of the earthquake on production, consumption, employment and expectations is being extensively evaluated. While the earthquake is expected to affect economic activity in the near term, it is anticipated that it will not have a permanent impact on performance of the Turkish economy in the medium term. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, the stronger than expected contribution of tourism revenues to the current account balance continues throughout the year. On the other hand, domestic consumption demand, high level of energy prices and the weak economic activity in main trade partners keep the risks on current account balance alive. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability. The rate of credit growth and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes are closely monitored. As announced in the 2023 Monetary Policy and Liraization Strategy document, the Committee will continue to decisively use the tools supporting the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism and the entire policy toolset, particularly funding channels, will be aligned with liraization targets. The Committee will prioritize the creation of supportive financial conditions in order to minimize the effects of the disaster and support the necessary recovery.
While level and underlying trend of inflation have been improved with the support of the implemented integrated policy approach, the effect of earthquake driven supply-demand imbalances on inflation is closely monitored. It has become even more important to keep financial conditions supportive to preserve the growth momentum in industrial production and the positive trend in employment after the earthquake. Accordingly, the Committee decided to reduce the policy rate by 50 basis. The Committee assessed that the current monetary policy stance after the measured reduction is adequate to support the necessary recovery in the aftermath of the earthquake by maintaining price stability and financial stability. The effects of the earthquake in the first half of 2023 will be closely monitored.
The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. The CBRT will implement Liraization Strategy in order to create an institutional basis for permanent and sustainable price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.

Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 23 February 2023
Inflation Developments
1.    In January, consumer prices increased by 6.65% while annual inflation decreased by 6.59 points to 57.68%. Annual inflation rose in the services group against a significant decline in all subgroups, being more pronounced in the energy group. In this period, the month-on-month rise in energy prices remained moderate, while the highest rise was observed in services. The course of services prices was affected by developments in food and minimum wage as well as groups affected by the revaluation rate and groups with time-dependent pricing behavior. Supported by the fall in energy prices, producer prices continued to decrease on an annual basis in January. Against this background, the annual rate of change in the B index decreased while that in the C index increased.
2.    Prices in the food and non-alcoholic beverages group increased by 6.62% month-on-month, exceeding its historical January average of recent years. In this group, annual inflation fell by 6.87 points to 71.00%. Annual inflation fell by 4.45 points to 68.80% in unprocessed food and by 8.44 points to 73.56% in processed food. In the unprocessed food group, seasonally adjusted data points to a decline in the prices of fresh fruits and vegetables, more pronounced in the vegetables group. In January, almost three-quarters of the rise in food prices was mainly driven by price developments in bread-cereals, as well as meat, milk and related products.
3.    In January, energy prices increased by 1.59%, and annual inflation in this group dropped by 39.40 points to 55.03%. In this period, the rise in municipal water prices continued, while prices of fuels and bottled gas increased due to the rise in the international oil, propane and butane prices. Meanwhile, there has been a decrease in natural gas prices.
4.    Services prices increased by 12.70% in January, and the group's annual inflation rose by 6.93 points to 62.42%. Annual inflation decreased in transport services but went up in other subgroups. The most significant rise in monthly price increases in the services group was registered in the other services subgroup with 16.10%. This monthly rise in the other services subgroup was driven by maintenance-repair, health, revaluation-related items and recreation-culture services. In the restaurants-hotels subgroup, prices were up by 12.73%, and annual inflation reached 75.13%. In transport services, prices rose by 10.23% driven by administered services whereas annual inflation receded to 77.97%. Communication services saw a monthly price increase of 8.14% led by mobile phone call charges while annual inflation climbed to 37.42%. The monthly increase in rents was 9.75% in January, and annual inflation in rents reached 57.07%.
5.    Annual inflation in core goods declined by 4.14 points to 44.82%. Annual inflation fell across all subgroups, more markedly in other core goods. Prices of durable goods rose by 4.92% in this period triggered by automobiles, furniture and white goods. In other core goods, prices increased by 4.01% in January led by the carry-over effect of medicine prices. Prices in the clothing and footwear subgroup were down by 1.75%, and annual inflation dropped by 1.69 points to 23.32% due to a stronger seasonal effect than the last year’s.
6.    Prices in the alcoholic beverages and tobacco products group increased by 11.19% in January, while annual inflation of the group decreased by 14.51 points to 50.60%. The automatic hike in taxes, which is linked to producer price developments in the second half of 2022, was the main factor driving prices in the group upwards.
7.    According to the February results of the Survey of Market Participants, inflation expectations remained almost flat as the 12-month ahead inflation expectation edged up by 0.31 points to 30.75%, and the 24-month ahead inflation expectation rose by 0.93 points to 18.11%.
Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks
8.    Although recently released data point to a stronger economic activity than anticipated, recession concerns in developed economies as a result of ongoing geopolitical risks and interest rate hikes continue.
9.    While the negative consequences of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly basic food, have been alleviated by the strategic solutions facilitated by Türkiye, the high level in producer and consumer inflation continues on an international scale. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored.
10.    The divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies continue to increase due to their diverse economic outlook. It is observed that central banks continue their efforts to develop new supportive measures and tools to cope with the increasing uncertainties in financial markets. Additionally, financial markets have been adjusting their expectations that the central banks would end the rate hike cycles in the near term on the back of the recession risks.
11.    Regarding portfolio flows to emerging economies, bond and equity markets saw inflows in February parallel to the improved global risk appetite. On the other hand, the volatility in the long-term bond yields in advanced economies and the course of global financial conditions keep the risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies alive.
12.    In January, international commodity prices recorded a limited increase while energy prices remained relatively flat across subcategories, and non-energy commodity prices edged up. On the back of the grain corridor, agricultural commodity prices remained moderate. A notable decline was seen in natural gas prices in January and February amid mild weather conditions and the significant build-up of gas stocks. International transportation costs fell further in January, while the recent stable course of exchange rates was maintained. Thus, annual producer inflation continued to decline.
13.    While level and underlying trend of inflation have been improved with the support of the implemented integrated policy approach, the effect of earthquake driven supply-demand imbalances on inflation is closely monitored.
14.    Indicators for the last quarter of 2022 show that a slowdown in growth due to the weakening foreign demand is compensated for by the relatively strong course in domestic demand. In December, industrial production rose by 1.6%, adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects, on a monthly basis but it decreased by 1.2% on an annual basis. On a quarterly basis, industrial production increased by 2% in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, retail sales volume index rose by 4.8% and 7.2% on a monthly and quarterly basis, respectively in December.
15.    Before the earthquakes, leading indicators were pointing to a stronger domestic demand compared to foreign demand as well as an increase in the growth trend in the first quarter of 2023. Manufacturing industry firms’ registered external and domestic orders increased on a quarterly basis, with a stronger uptick in domestic market orders. The upward trend in card expenditures also continued in the first quarter. Accordingly, indicators, which mostly reflect pre-earthquake data, suggest that domestic demand remained stronger compared to external demand in the first quarter.
16.    After the earthquake, uncertainty loomed over the indicators related to economic activity. In addition to direct effects, the earthquake will have indirect effects through reconstruction activities and supportive policies, which will cause various sectoral and regional repercussions changing over time. The impact of the earthquake on production, consumption, employment and expectations is being extensively evaluated. The short-run effects of the earthquake seem to have been partly reflected on production and order expectations of manufacturing industry firms in February. Real sector and sectoral confidence indices also declined on a monthly basis in February. High-frequency foreign trade data for February, on the other hand, suggest that exports from the earthquake-hit zone have shown a recovery trend after the post-disaster decline. Participation in production is expected to gradually pick up in the upcoming weeks on the back of intensive measures taken for employees. In the meantime, detailed information obtained from field interviews indicate that the industrial production infrastructure in the affected region has been largely maintained and production has been sustained. While the earthquake is expected to affect economic activity in the near term, it is anticipated that it will not have a permanent impact on performance of the Turkish economy in the medium term.
17.    In December 2022, seasonally adjusted employment remained almost flat compared to the previous month, while increasing by 1.8% on a quarterly basis. The seasonally adjusted labor force participation rate increased by 0.1 points monthly to 54.1%, yet the unemployment rate went up by 0.1 points month-on-month to 10.3%. In the last quarter of 2022, employment posted quarterly growth across all sectors. Survey indicators and high-frequency data indicate that the upward trend in employment is maintained.
18.    Despite the increase in the foreign trade deficit led by the acceleration in gold imports, the ongoing upward trend in services revenues continues to support the current account balance. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, the stronger than expected contribution of tourism revenues to the current account balance continues throughout the year. On the other hand, domestic consumption demand, high level of energy prices and the weak economic activity in main trade partners keep the risks on current account balance alive. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability.
Monetary Policy
19.    The monetary policy stance will be determined by taking into account the evaluations on the source and permanence of risks, along with the extent to which they can be contained by monetary policy, and with a focus on achieving the sustainable price stability target, in a cautious manner.
20.    In formulating the monetary policy towards achieving the sustainable price stability objective, a liraization-oriented approach will be maintained that also addresses risks to financial stability. The rate of credit growth and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes are closely monitored.
21.    The Committee will prioritize the creation of supportive financial conditions in order to minimize the effects of the disaster and support the necessary recovery. Accordingly, in addition to the existing supportive measures, the Committee considered the issue of making a revision in the tools that support the liquidity conditions, if necessary, as stated in the Monetary Policy and Liraization Strategy for 2023.
22.    After the earthquake, it has become even more important to keep financial conditions supportive to preserve the growth momentum in industrial production and the positive trend in employment. Accordingly, the Committee decided to reduce the policy rate by 50 basis points. The Committee assessed that the current monetary policy stance after the measured reduction is adequate to support the necessary recovery in the aftermath of the earthquake by maintaining price stability and financial stability. The effects of the earthquake in the first half of 2023 will be closely monitored.
23.    The CBRT will implement Liraization Strategy in order to create an institutional basis for permanent and sustainable price stability. As announced in the 2023 Monetary Policy and Liraization Strategy document, the Committee will continue to decisively use the tools supporting the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism and the entire policy toolset, particularly funding channels, will be aligned with liraization targets. The focus of this process will be on developing policy instruments to support the improvement of Turkish lira deposits, to increase Turkish lira-denominated assets in the collateral structure of Open Market Operations funding, to reduce the weight of swaps in the composition of funding, and to strengthen foreign exchange reserves.
24.    The rise in the demand for long-term, fixed-income and Turkish lira-denominated assets and the course of the yield curve in tandem with the direction of the efficiency of monetary transmission are closely monitored. Along with credit growth, the Committee will also consider the improvement in financing costs of loans providing efficiency gains in targeted areas so as to maintain the transmission.
25.    Accordingly, the effects of liquidity and distribution developments of the Turkish lira on deposits and loan pricing, the effects of exchange rate developments on inflation, and the impact of the developments regarding FX-protected deposit products on reverse currency substitution, the depth and stability of the foreign exchange market, and price stability are being analyzed, and necessary policy measures are being taken.
26.    The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5% target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability.
27.    Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.
28.    The Committee supports building strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders in order to achieve price stability.
29.    The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework."

Şahap Kavcıoğlu (Governor), Taha Çakmak, Mustafa Duman, Elif Haykır Hobikoğlu, Emrah Şener.
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 8.5 percent.
Although recently released data point to a stronger economic activity than anticipated, recession concerns in developed economies as a result of geopolitical risks and interest rate hikes continue, and conditions threatening financial stability have emerged. While the negative consequences of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly basic food, have been alleviated by the strategic solutions facilitated by Türkiye, the high level in producer and consumer inflation continues on an international scale. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. While the divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies continue due to their diverse economic outlook, coordinated steps are taken that prioritize financial stability through swap agreements and new liquidity facilities. Financial markets have been adjusting their expectations that the central banks would end the rate hike cycles in the near term.
Before the disaster of the century, leading indicators have been pointing to a stronger domestic demand compared to foreign demand as well as an increase in the growth trend in the first quarter of 2023.

2023,30 March 2023,Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting,"No: 2023-14
30 March 2023
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 23 March 2023
Inflation Developments
1.    In February, consumer prices increased by 3.15%, while annual inflation decreased by 2.50 points to 55.18%. The annual inflation decreased across all groups, being more pronounced in the energy group. On a monthly basis, the rise in food and services groups stood out with price increases. Supported by the significant fall in energy prices, producer prices remained limited and the decline in annual producer inflation continued in February. Against this background, seasonally adjusted data point that the monthly increase in B and C indices slowed down significantly compared to January, while annual inflation decreased in both indices.
2.    In February, prices in the food and non-alcoholic beverages group increased by 7.36%, while annual inflation in this group fell by 1.67 points to 69.33%. Annual inflation fell by 2.67 points to 66.13% in unprocessed food and increased by 0.31 points to 73.87% in processed food. Seasonally adjusted data point that prices of fresh fruits and vegetables increased in February, more visibly in the vegetables group. Besides fresh fruits and vegetables prices, the red meat prices stood out with price increases, while prices of processed food items related to these products displayed a similar course. On the other hand, as the fixed price campaigns in the retail sector ended, prices of milk and dairy products increased.
3.    In February, energy prices rose by 0.64%, and annual inflation in this group dropped by 5.02 points to 50.01%. The stable course of exchange rates and the favorable outlook in international energy prices led to moderate price movements in this group. Due to developments in international propane and butane prices, bottled gas prices diverged from the general trend.
4.    Prices in the services group increased by 3.14% while the group's annual inflation decreased by 0.78 points to 61.64%. While annual inflation rose to a limited extent in the rents subgroup, it remained flat in communication and other services, and declined in transport and restaurants-hotels subgroups. As effects arising from time-dependent price adjustments and the minimum wage adjustment faded, the rise in services group prices weakened in February. Due to the moderate course of fuel prices as well as the fall in passenger transport by air tariffs, the monthly rise in the prices of transport services remained limited, and annual inflation in the subgroup decreased by 7.70 points to 70.27%. The monthly increase in the rents subgroup significantly decelerated compared to January and remained at 2.66%. Prices in the other services subgroup increased by 3.64%, while maintenance and repair of personal transport equipment and education services prices were remarkable. Meanwhile, in the restaurants-hotels subgroup, prices were up by 4.07% while annual inflation in the subgroup displayed a limited fall and came down to 74.34%.
5.    Annual inflation in core goods declined by 3.76 points to 41.06% in February. Annual inflation fell across all subgroups, more markedly in other core goods. In February, prices of durable goods (excluding gold) rose by 2.49%, driven by automobiles and furniture, while prices of white goods remained flat as opposed to previous months. Against this background, annual inflation in the durable goods subgroup decreased by 1.09 points to 44.93%. In other core goods, prices were up by 1.14% in February, showing a significant slowdown compared to previous months, and annual inflation in this subgroup dropped by 8.38 points to 48.48%. Prices in the clothing and footwear subgroup were down by 1.89% on the back of the ongoing seasonal discounts, pulling annual inflation down by 2.61 points to 20.71%.
6.    According to the March results of the Survey of Market Participants, the 12-month ahead inflation expectation edged up by 0.88 points to 31.63%, while the 24-month ahead inflation expectation declined by 0.20 points to 17.91%. The five-year ahead inflation expectation, on the other hand, was measured as 9.00%.
Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks
7.    Although recently released data point to a stronger economic activity than anticipated, recession concerns in developed economies as a result of geopolitical risks and interest rate hikes continue, and conditions threatening financial stability have emerged.
8.    While the negative consequences of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly basic food, have been alleviated by the strategic solutions facilitated by Türkiye, the high level in producer and consumer inflation continues on an international scale. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored.
9.    While the divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies continue due to their diverse economic outlook, coordinated steps are taken that prioritize financial stability through swap agreements and new liquidity facilities. Financial markets have been adjusting their expectations that the central banks would end the rate hike cycles in the near term.
10.    Regarding portfolio flows to emerging economies, bond and equity markets saw outflows in March parallel to the decline in the global risk appetite. In the meantime, the volatility in the long-term bond yields in advanced economies and the course of global financial conditions keep the risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies alive.
11.    International commodity prices went down in February, driven by energy and industrial metal sub-indices, whereas the agriculture sub-index posted a limited increase. The fall in international natural gas prices continued in March amid mild weather conditions and the significant build-up of gas stocks. Accordingly, industrial natural gas tariffs were revised down further in March. International transportation costs remained on a downward trend in February, while the recent stable course of exchange rates was maintained. Against this background, the rise in producer prices decelerated compared to January, and the downward trend in annual producer inflation continued.
12.    While level and underlying trend of inflation have been improved with the support of the implemented integrated policy approach, the effect of earthquake-driven supply-demand imbalances on inflation is closely monitored.
13.    Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data for the last quarter of 2022 indicate a quarterly recovery in economic activity despite a slight decline in the growth rate in annual terms compared to the third quarter. GDP rose by 3.5% on an annual basis in this period, while it increased quarter-on-quarter by 0.9% in seasonally and calendar adjusted terms. Thus, the overall growth in 2022 stood at 5.6%. Throughout the year, the share of net exports and investments in GDP remained above historical averages. Machinery-equipment investments, one of the sub-items of investments, maintained their upward trend in annual terms for the thirteenth consecutive quarter. While the largest contribution to growth came from domestic demand in the last quarter of 2022, the impact of weak foreign demand was mirrored in the industrial sector’s contribution to growth.
14.    Before the disaster of the century, leading indicators have been pointing to a stronger domestic demand compared to foreign demand as well as an increase in the growth trend in the first quarter of 2023. In January, industrial production rose by 1.9% in seasonally and calendar adjusted terms on a monthly basis and by 7% on an annual basis. Thus, industrial production increased by 2.6% quarterly as of January. Meanwhile, the retail sales volume index increased by 5.4% on a monthly basis in January. The quarterly flat course in registered export orders of manufacturing firms as well as the increase in registered domestic orders confirm that domestic demand was stronger compared to foreign demand.
15.    After the earthquake, uncertainty loomed over the indicators related to economic activity. In addition to direct effects, the earthquake will have indirect effects through reconstruction activities and supportive policies, which will cause various sectoral and regional repercussions changing over time. The impact of the earthquake on production, consumption, employment and expectations is being extensively evaluated. High-frequency foreign trade data for March, on the other hand, suggest that exports from the earthquake-hit zone have shown a recovery trend following the post-disaster decline. Likewise, high-frequency labor market data imply that job posts and applications across the country recovered in the following weeks despite a limited loss of momentum in the aftermath of the earthquake. Card expenditures, on the other hand, are slightly below the pre-earthquake trend in the disaster zone. In the meantime, detailed information obtained from field interviews indicate that the industrial production infrastructure in the affected region has been largely maintained and production has been sustained. While the earthquake is expected to affect economic activity in the near term, it is anticipated that it will not have a permanent impact on performance of the Turkish economy in the medium term.
16.    In January 2023, seasonally adjusted employment increased by 0.8% (264 thousand people) compared to the previous month, while it rose by 1.2% (377 thousand people) on a quarterly basis. The seasonally adjusted labor force participation rate remained unchanged compared to previous month and stood at 54.1%, while the unemployment rate fell by 0.6 points to 9.7% on a monthly basis. Survey indicators and high-frequency data indicate that the upward trend in employment has been maintained, albeit a slight deceleration after the earthquake.
17.    Despite the increase in the foreign trade deficit led by the acceleration in gold imports, the ongoing upward trend in services revenues continues to support the current account balance. While share of sustainable components of economic growth remains high, the stronger-than-expected contribution of tourism revenues to the current account balance continues throughout the year. On the other hand, domestic consumption demand, high level of energy prices and the weak economic activity in main trade partners keep the risks on current account balance alive. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability.
Monetary Policy
18.    The monetary policy stance will be determined by taking into account the evaluations on the source and permanence of risks, along with the extent to which they can be contained by monetary policy, and with a focus on achieving the sustainable price stability target, in a cautious manner.
19.    In formulating the monetary policy towards achieving the sustainable price stability objective, a liraization-oriented approach will be maintained that also addresses risks to financial stability. The rate of credit growth and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes are closely monitored.
20.    The Committee will prioritize the creation of supportive financial conditions in order to minimize the effects of the disaster and support the necessary recovery. Accordingly, in addition to the existing supportive measures, the Committee considered the issue of making a revision in the tools that support the liquidity conditions, if necessary, as stated in the Monetary Policy and Liraization Strategy for 2023.
21.    It has become even more important to keep financial conditions supportive to preserve the growth momentum in industrial production and the positive trend in employment after the earthquake. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. The Committee assessed that the current monetary policy stance is adequate to support the necessary recovery in the aftermath of the earthquake by maintaining price stability and financial stability. The effects of the earthquake in the first half of 2023 will be closely monitored.
22.    The CBRT will implement Liraization Strategy in order to create an institutional basis for permanent and sustainable price stability. As announced in the 2023 Monetary Policy and Liraization Strategy document, the Committee will continue to decisively use the tools supporting the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism and the entire policy toolset, particularly funding channels, will be aligned with liraization targets. The focus of this process will be on developing policy instruments to support the improvement of Turkish lira deposits, to increase Turkish lira-denominated assets in the collateral structure of Open Market Operations funding, to reduce the weight of swaps in the composition of funding, and to strengthen foreign exchange reserves.
23.    The rise in the demand for long-term, fixed-income and Turkish lira-denominated assets and the course of the yield curve in tandem with the direction of the efficiency of monetary transmission are closely monitored. Along with credit growth, the Committee will also consider the improvement in financing costs of loans providing efficiency gains in targeted areas so as to maintain the transmission.
24.    Accordingly, the effects of liquidity and distribution developments of the Turkish lira on deposits and loan pricing, the effects of exchange rate developments on inflation, and the impact of the developments regarding FX-protected deposit products on reverse currency substitution, the depth and stability of the foreign exchange market, and price stability are being analyzed, and necessary policy measures are being taken.

Although recently released data point to a stronger economic activity than anticipated, recession concerns in developed economies as a result of geopolitical risks and interest rate hikes continue, and conditions threatening financial stability, triggered by successive bank failures, have emerged.

3 May 2023
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 27 April 2023
Inflation Developments
1.    In March, consumer prices increased by 2.29%, while annual inflation decreased by 4.67 points to 50.51%. Annual inflation decreased across all groups, being more pronounced in the energy group. On a monthly basis, the food and services groups stood out with price increases. Supported by the significant fall in energy prices, the rise in producer prices remained limited and the decline in annual producer inflation was sustained in March. Against this background, seasonally adjusted B and C core indicators have recorded the lowest monthly increase since October 2021, while annual inflation receded in both indicators.
2.    Prices of the food and non-alcoholic beverages group increased by 3.84% in March, while annual inflation in this group fell by 1.44 points to 67.89%. Annual inflation dropped by 0.19 points to 65.94% in unprocessed food and by 2.19 points to 71.68% in processed food. Seasonally adjusted data point that prices of fresh fruits and vegetables decreased in March, more visibly in vegetables. Price developments excluding fresh fruits and vegetables reveal that red meat and white meat as well as related processed food items diverged with price increases. On the other hand, non-alcoholic beverages and fruit juices, sugar and related products as well as eggs were other items that stood out. Meanwhile, price increases continued in the bread and cereals group in March.
3.    Energy prices rose by 0.38% on a monthly basis, while annual inflation in this group dropped by 14.35 points to 35.66%. Receding international energy prices coupled with the stable course of exchange rates led to moderate price movements across the group in March. Municipal water tariffs diverged from the group’s outlook with a price increase (1.97%). The mild course in the group’s prices is projected to continue due to the reduction in residential electricity tariffs in April and the expected fall in residential natural gas bills in the period ahead.
4.    Prices in the services group increased by 3.08% while the group's annual inflation decreased by 1.71 points to 59.93%. In this period, annual inflation declined in restaurants-hotels, communication, other services, and particularly in transport, while it recorded an increase in rents. The rent and restaurants-hotels subgroups stood out with monthly price increases. Prices in transport services edged up by 1.01% amid the positive outlook for fuel prices, while annual inflation in this subgroup declined by 13.15 points to 57.12%. The outlook for food, particularly red meat prices, brought prices of restaurants-hotels up (3.85%), pulling the subgroup’s annual inflation down by 3.61 points to 70.73%. Other services prices were up by 2.65% in March, driven by package tours and education services due to higher private school fees. The monthly increase in the rent subgroup accelerated by 4.89%, and the group's annual inflation reached 62.76%.
5.    Annual inflation in core goods declined by 4.48 points to 36.58%. Annual inflation fell across subgroups in March. Prices of durable goods (excluding gold) rose by 1.67% month-on-month, and the subgroup’s annual inflation dropped by 4.72 points to 40.21%.  In durable goods, the furniture item stood out with price increases, while prices of white goods and automobiles rose relatively moderately. In other core goods, prices edged up by 2.52%, while annual inflation fell by 4.00 points to 44.48%. In this period, following the regulation in legal profitability scales at mid-month, medicine prices increased by 5.38%, led by low-priced products. The effects of this increase in medicine prices are expected to carry over into April.  Household cleaning products were another item that came to the forefront in the subgroup with price increases in March. Prices in the clothing and footwear subgroup went down by 2.02% due to the ongoing seasonal discounts unlike previous years. Accordingly, annual inflation in this subgroup dropped by 4.45 points to 16.26%. 
6.    According to the April results of the Survey of Market Participants, the 12-month ahead inflation expectation decreased by 0.61 points to 31.02%. The 24-month ahead inflation expectation was revised down by 0.37 points to 17.54%. The five-year ahead inflation expectation, on the other hand, was measured as 9.03%.
Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks 
7.    Although recently released data point to a stronger economic activity than anticipated, recession concerns in developed economies as a result of geopolitical risks and interest rate hikes continue, and conditions threatening financial stability, triggered by successive bank failures, have emerged.
8.    While the negative consequences of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly basic food, have been alleviated by the strategic solutions facilitated by Türkiye, the high level in producer and consumer inflation continues on an international scale. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored.
9.    While the divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies continues due to their diverse economic outlook, coordinated steps are taken that prioritize financial stability through swap agreements and new liquidity facilities. Financial markets have been adjusting their expectations that the central banks would end the rate hike cycles in the near term.
10.    Regarding portfolio flows to emerging economies, bond and equity markets saw inflows in April parallel to the improvement in the global risk appetite. In the meantime, the volatility in the long-term bond yields in advanced economies and the course of global financial conditions keep the risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies alive.
11.    In March, international commodity prices posted a decline that spread across subgroups. Global food prices continued to decrease led by cereals and vegetable oils. After having dropped in March, crude oil prices increased in early April following the OPEC’s quota cut decision, but prices returned to their pre-decision levels by the end of the month. The downward trend in international natural gas prices continued in April, albeit at a slower pace. Accordingly, domestic industrial natural gas tariffs were reduced further in April. While the indicator regarding the pressures on the global supply chain hovered below its historical trend, domestic problems faced after the earthquake were largely eliminated by March. The favorable outlook of international transportation costs was maintained in March. Against this background, producer prices increased slightly by 0.44%, led by the energy group, and the downward trend in annual producer inflation continued.
12.    While level and underlying trend of inflation have been improved with the support of the implemented integrated policy approach, the effect of earthquake-driven supply-demand imbalances on inflation is closely monitored.
13.    Before the disaster of the century, leading indicators have been pointing to a stronger domestic demand compared to foreign demand as well as an increase in the growth trend in the first quarter of 2023. Following the rise in January, the seasonally and calendar adjusted industrial production index declined by 6% on a monthly basis in February due to the earthquake. In the January-February period, industrial production edged down by 0.4% in quarterly terms. Meanwhile, the seasonally and calendar adjusted retail sales volume index increased by 5.1% on a quarterly basis in the January-February period despite having decreased on a monthly basis in February following the strong rise in January. Other indicators of consumption demand and the survey data suggest that production and consumption, which dropped due to the disaster-related effects in February, posted a strong recovery trend in March that was driven more by domestic demand than foreign demand.
14.    The impact of the earthquake on production, consumption, employment and expectations is being extensively evaluated. While the earthquake is expected to affect economic activity in the near term, it is anticipated that it will not have a permanent impact on the performance of the Turkish economy in the medium term.
15.    Leading indicators show that the economic activity in the earthquake zone has been recovering faster than expected. Credit card expenditures continued to recover towards pre-disaster levels as of end-March in the most severely affected provinces, while they exceeded pre-disaster levels in other provinces in the disaster zone. Similarly, in seasonally adjusted terms, after a decline in February, exports from the disaster zone in March converged to their pre-disaster level. An analysis of the Business Tendency Survey (BTS) data by provinces reveals that production and demand expectations also increased in March in provinces with high economic weight in the disaster area. Detailed information derived from field interviews also confirms that the strong recovery trend in the disaster area continues.
16.    After a rise in January, seasonally adjusted employment declined in February, but increased by 0.8% (260 thousand people) on a quarterly basis in the January-February period. In February, the unemployment rate rose by 0.3 percentage points to 10% due to the decline in the seasonally adjusted labor force participation rate as well as the decrease in employment. On a quarterly basis, the labor force participation rate increased by 0.2 points quarter-on-quarter to 53.9% in the January-February period, while the unemployment rate fell by 0.3 points to 9.9%. The impact of the earthquake on the labor market in the disaster zone will be evaluated more clearly in the coming months. Along with the flow of data on employment, survey indicators and high-frequency data are also closely monitored. Data on employment expectations, job vacancies and job applications suggest that despite a limited deceleration in the aftermath of the disaster, the upward trend in employment has been maintained across the country owing to the strong recovery that followed the deceleration.
17.    While share of sustainable components of economic growth remains high, the stronger-than-expected contribution of tourism revenues to the current account balance continues throughout the year. On the other hand, domestic consumption demand, high level of energy prices and the weak economic activity in main trade partners keep the risks on current account balance alive. Despite the widening foreign trade deficit in consumption goods, the decline in energy imports and the ongoing upward trend in services revenues continue to support the current account balance. Meanwhile, gold imports have been decelerating over the last few weeks. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability.
Monetary Policy
18.    The monetary policy stance will be determined by taking into account the evaluations on the source and permanence of risks, along with the extent to which they can be contained by monetary policy, and with a focus on achieving the sustainable price stability target, in a cautious manner.
19.    In formulating the monetary policy towards achieving the sustainable price stability objective, a liraization-oriented approach will be maintained that also addresses risks to financial stability. The rate of credit growth and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes are closely monitored.
20.    The Committee will prioritize the creation of supportive financial conditions in order to minimize the effects of the disaster and support the necessary recovery. It has become even more important to keep financial conditions supportive to preserve the growth momentum in industrial production and the positive trend in employment after the earthquake. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. The Committee assessed that the current monetary policy stance is adequate to support the necessary recovery in the aftermath of the earthquake by maintaining price stability and financial stability. The effects of the earthquake in the first half of 2023 will be closely monitored.
21.    The CBRT will implement Liraization Strategy in order to create an institutional basis for permanent and sustainable price stability. As announced in the 2023 Monetary Policy and Liraization Strategy document, the Committee will continue to decisively use the tools supporting the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism and the entire policy toolset, particularly funding channels, will be aligned with liraization targets. The focus of this process will be on developing policy instruments to support the improvement of Turkish lira deposits, to increase Turkish lira-denominated assets in the collateral structure of Open Market Operations funding, to reduce the weight of swaps in the composition of funding, and to strengthen foreign exchange reserves.
22.    The rise in the demand for long-term, fixed-income and Turkish lira-denominated assets and the course of the yield curve in tandem with the direction of the efficiency of monetary transmission are closely monitored. Along with credit growth, the Committee will also consider the improvement in financing costs of loans providing efficiency gains in targeted areas so as to maintain the transmission.
23.    Accordingly, the effects of liquidity and distribution developments of the Turkish lira on deposits and loan pricing, the effects of exchange rate developments on inflation, and the impact of the developments regarding FX-protected deposit products on reverse currency substitution, the depth and stability of the foreign exchange market, and price stability are being analyzed, and necessary policy measures are being taken.
24.    The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability.
25.    Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.
26.    The Committee supports building strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders in order to achieve price stability.
27.    The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework."

The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 8.5 percent.
Although recently released data point to a stronger economic activity than anticipated, recession concerns in developed economies as a result of geopolitical risks and interest rate hikes continue, and conditions threatening financial stability, triggered by successive bank failures, have emerged.

Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 25 May 2023
Inflation Developments
1.    Consumer prices rose by 2.39% in April while annual inflation decreased by 6.83 points to 43.68%. Annual inflation declined across all groups, more visibly in energy and food groups. On a monthly basis, prices dropped in the energy group but increased in food and services groups. Supported by the ongoing significant fall in energy prices, the monthly rise in producer prices remained limited and the fall in annual producer inflation continued. Against this background, in seasonally adjusted terms, monthly increases remained on the decline in the B index but edged up in the C index, while annual inflation receded in both indicators.
2.    Prices of the food and non-alcoholic beverages group increased by 3.95% in April, while annual inflation in this group fell by 13.97 points to 53.92%. Annual inflation dropped by 13.24 points to 52.70% in unprocessed food and by 13.93 points to 57.75% in processed food. Seasonally adjusted data point that prices of fresh fruits and vegetables rose in April, driven by vegetables. An analysis of unprocessed food price developments excluding fresh fruits and vegetables reveals that the rise in red meat and white meat prices continued. The monthly price increase in the processed food subgroup continued to decelerate, posting a limited rise of 0.97%. Excluding processed meat products, price movements were moderate across the group, while the deceleration of the price increase in bread and cereals was noticeable.
3.    Energy prices receded significantly by 3.86% on a monthly basis, while annual inflation in this group dropped by 14.47 points to 21.19%. This was driven by the favorable course of global price movements. While residential electricity tariffs decreased by 15% in this period, fuel (-1.24%) and bottled gas (-4.66%) prices also declined. Meanwhile, municipal water tariffs continued to diverge from the group’s outlook with a price increase (1.74%). The fall in energy prices is projected to continue also in May.
4.    Prices in the services group rose by 3.89%, while the group’s annual inflation decreased by 1.31 points to 58.62%. In this period, annual inflation decreased in the transport and restaurants-hotels subgroups, more visibly in the transport, while it remained flat in other services, and increased in rents and communication. On a monthly basis, prices in transport services, driven by the rise in intercity passenger transportation by road, rose by 3.08%, while annual inflation in the subgroup decreased by 11.68 points to 45.44%. Due to the outlook for food prices, particularly for red meat prices, monthly price increases in the restaurants-hotels group remained high (4.24%), and annual inflation in the subgroup decreased by 4.32 points to 66.41%. The rise in the other services subgroup (2.70%) was mainly driven by package tours, maintenance-repair and education items. Annual inflation in rents increased to 66.76% following the monthly increase of 4.37%. In the communication subgroup, prices rose significantly by 8.02%, mainly due to the increases in mobile phone call and internet charges.
5.    Annual inflation in core goods decreased by 2.42 points to 34.16%. Annual inflation fell across subgroups. Prices of durable goods (excluding gold) increased by 3.05% month-on-month, while annual inflation in this subgroup fell by 2.74 points to 37.47%. In April, prices in automobiles and white goods further increased, whereas slowed down in furniture. Prices in other core goods subgroup rose by 1.09%, while annual inflation in this subgroup decreased by 1.15 points to 43.33%. Due to the carryover effects of the revision made in the legal profitability scales of the retail sale of pharmaceuticals in mid- March, medicine prices increased by 5.36% becoming the main driver of the monthly price increases in the subgroup. In the clothing and footwear subgroup, prices increased by 3.80%, while annual inflation fell by 3.49 points to 12.77%. The change in the methodology, which includes the shift of the month of entry of summer products in the clothing and footwear group into the index from April to May, also has the expected effects on the index in these two months.
6.    According to the May results of the Survey of Market Participants, the 12-month ahead inflation expectation decreased by 1.18 points to 29.84%. The 24-month ahead inflation expectation and the five-year ahead inflation expectation were measured as 17.74% and 8.22%, respectively.
Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks
7.    Although recently released data point to a stronger economic activity than anticipated, recession concerns in developed economies as a result of geopolitical risks and interest rate hikes continue, and conditions threatening financial stability, triggered by successive bank failures, have emerged.
8.    While the negative consequences of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly basic food, have been alleviated by the strategic solutions facilitated by Türkiye, the high level in producer and consumer inflation continues on an international scale. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored.
9.    While the divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies continue due to their diverse economic outlook, coordinated steps are taken that prioritize financial stability through swap agreements and new liquidity facilities. Financial markets have been adjusting their expectations that the central banks would end the rate hike cycles in the near term.
10.    Regarding portfolio flows to emerging economies, equity markets continued to see inflows in May, while bond markets posted outflows. In the meantime, the volatility in the long-term bond yields in advanced economies and the course of global financial conditions keep the risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies alive.
11.    Having increased until mid-April, international commodity prices resumed their downtrend. This decline became broad-based across subgroups, with the energy sub-index falling more noticeably. The retreat in the energy sub-index was not limited to crude oil, but rather spread to products such as propane, butane and natural gas. Indicators for pressures on the global supply chain continued to hover below their historical trend, while international transportation costs remained mild in April. Against this background, producer prices increased slightly by 0.81%, and annual producer inflation decreased by 10.34 points to 52.11%.
12.    In addition to international developments, energy consumption supports, natural gas in particular, have been affecting the disinflation process favorably. The decision to provide household natural gas free of charge for full use in May and for use of 25 cubic meters for the following 11 months is likely to have a stronger-than-expected downward effect on prices in the coming months, due to the significant weight of natural gas in the consumption basket and the country-wide coverage of this support. In the absence of additional supports, this downward effect will gradually become neutralized within the index in the last quarter of the year, as cold weather and consumption of energy for heating purposes come into effect.
13.    While level and underlying trend of inflation continue to improve with the support of the implemented integrated policy approach, the effect of earthquake-driven supply-demand imbalances on inflation is closely monitored.
14.    Before the disaster of the century, leading indicators were pointing to a stronger domestic demand compared to foreign demand as well as an increase in the growth trend in the first quarter of 2023. The seasonally and calendar adjusted industrial production index fell by 5.9% on a monthly basis in February, but showed a significant recovery in March by 5.5%. Thus, in the first quarter, the industrial production index increased by 0.4% on a quarterly basis despite the impact of the disaster. Meanwhile, having contracted in February, the seasonally and calendar adjusted retail sales volume index increased by 7.3% on a monthly basis in March, exceeding its pre-disaster level. Thus, in the first quarter, the index recorded an increase of 6.5% quarter-on-quarter, thereby confirming the strong course of domestic demand. Other indicators of consumption demand and the survey data suggest that production and consumption, which dropped due to the disaster-related effects in February, have posted a strong recovery trend since March, and that domestic demand has been stronger than foreign demand.
15.    Recent data show that economic activity in the earthquake zone has been recovering faster than expected, and it is becoming evident that the earthquake will not have a permanent impact on performance of the Turkish economy in the medium term. Credit card expenditures continued to recover towards pre-disaster levels as of mid-May in the most severely affected provinces, while they are above the pre-disaster levels in other provinces in the disaster zone. Similarly, in seasonally adjusted terms, after a decline in February, exports from the disaster zone as of May are converging further to their pre-disaster level. Detailed information derived from field interviews also confirms that the strong recovery trend in the disaster area continues and there is no medium-term loss in production capacity on a sectoral basis.
16.    After a decline in February, seasonally adjusted employment remained flat in March. Thus, employment increased by 195 thousand people in the first quarter and rose by 0.6% on a quarterly basis. In March, the seasonally adjusted labor force participation rate remained almost unchanged, while the unemployment rate remained intact at 10% due to the limited rise in employment. On a quarterly basis, the labor force participation rate stood at 53.7% in the first quarter, while the unemployment rate fell by 0.3 points to 9.9%. The impact of the earthquake on the labor market in the disaster zone will be evaluated more clearly in the coming months. Along with the flow of data on employment, survey indicators and high-frequency data are also closely monitored. Data on employment expectations, job vacancies and job applications suggest that despite a limited deceleration in the aftermath of the disaster, the upward trend in employment has been maintained across the country owing to the strong recovery that followed the deceleration.
17.    While the share of sustainable components of economic growth remains high, the stronger-than-expected contribution of tourism revenues to the current account balance continues throughout the year. On the other hand, the ongoing increase in domestic consumption demand, high level of energy prices and the weak economic activity in main trade partners keep the risks on current account balance alive. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability.

Participating Committee Members
Hafize Gaye Erkan (Governor), Taha Çakmak, Mustafa Duman, Elif Haykır Hobikoğlu, Emrah Şener.
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to increase the policy rate (the one-week repo auction rate) from 8.5 percent to 15 percent.
The Committee decided to begin the monetary tightening process in order to establish the disinflation course as soon as possible, to anchor inflation expectations, and to control the deterioration in pricing behavior.
While inflation in the world has been declining, it remains well above the long-term averages. As a result, central banks across the globe continue to take measures to reduce inflation.
In our country, recent indicators point to an increase in the underlying trend of inflation. The strong course of domestic demand, cost pressures and the stickiness of services inflation have been the main drivers. In addition to these factors, the Committee anticipates that the deterioration in pricing behavior will put further pressure on inflation.
The Committee will determine the policy rate in a way that will create monetary and financial conditions necessary to ensure a decline in the underlying trend of inflation and to reach the 5 percent inflation target in the medium term. Monetary tightening will be further strengthened as much as needed in a timely and gradual manner until a significant improvement in the inflation outlook is achieved. Indicators of inflation and the underlying inflation trend will be closely monitored and the CBRT will continue to decisively use all the tools at its disposal in line with its main objective of price stability.
The monetary tightening process will increase the effectiveness of monetary policy. In addition, in order to be able to sustain price stability in the long-term, the CBRT will continue to support strategic investments that will improve the current account balance.
To increase the functionality of market mechanisms and strengthen macro financial stability, the Committee will simplify and improve the existing micro- and macroprudential framework. Guided by impact analyses, the simplification process will be gradual.
The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a predictable, data-driven and transparent framework.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 22 June 2023
Global Economy
1.    While global inflation has decreased, it is still above the long-term averages. In the last ten years, the average inflation was 2.2% in advanced economies and 5.6% in emerging economies. In 2023, inflation is expected to be 3.3% in advanced economies and 8.1% in emerging economies. Although the downward trend in commodity prices that started in the middle of last year continues, the current level of the Commodity Price Index is 23.2% above the average of the last ten years. The index decreased by 29.4% compared to the highest level reached in June last year. Similarly, the Agricultural Commodity Price Index, which declined by 22.0% compared to the peak it reached in April last year, is 14.3% above the average of the last ten years. This still has an impact on inflation due to the high share of food in the consumer basket. In 2023, year-end inflation expectations in the USA and the Euro area are 3.0% and 3.8%, respectively; while core inflation expectations are 4.3% and 5.1%, respectively.
2.    High levels of core inflation and inflation expectations imply that global inflation will continue to remain above the targets of central banks for a while. For this reason, central banks all over the world take measures to reduce inflation. The central banks of 12 advanced countries held a total of 123 meetings in the last 16 months, and policy rates were increased in 89 of these meetings. During the same period, 15 emerging countries' central banks held a total of 182 meetings, and policy rates were increased in 97 of these meetings. The results of the implemented monetary policy have begun affecting financial conditions, and central banks' emphasis on tightening financing and credit conditions has strengthened.
3.    Despite the flat global growth outlook, relatively strong demand and tight labor markets persist. The global growth index, which is weighted with export shares of Türkiye’s foreign trade partners, has continued its flat course compared to the previous MPC meeting period. The index is projected to grow by 1.6% in 2023, which is approximately 0.3 points higher than the trough in January. However, when the 3.5% growth of the index in 2022 is considered, a notable slowdown in foreign demand, on an annual basis, in 2023 is evident. Global PMI indices indicate that the services sector activity remains robust, while the manufacturing industry continues to follow a flat course just below the threshold value. As of May, the global services PMI rose by 3.1 points quarter-on-quarter to 55.4 in the second quarter of the year, while the manufacturing PMI increased by 0.1 points to 49.6. The composite PMI index was 54.4 in May with an increase of 0.2 points compared to the level in April at the global level, remained flat at 53.7 in advanced economies, and rose to 55.6 with an increase of 0.7 points in emerging economies. While the composite PMI indicator in China was 55.6 with an increase of 2 points compared to April, the index was above the 50-threshold level in both the manufacturing and services sectors in May. Besides, it was observed that the recovery in services was more pronounced after the relaxation of pandemic measures. On the other hand, expectations for a slowdown in economic activity in advanced economies due to financial conditions continue. In the euro area, one of Türkiye's major trading partners, the manufacturing PMI fell to 44.8 in May, the lowest level since the pandemic.
4.    Portfolio flows to emerging markets continued in June on the back of improving risk sentiment. While there is an inflow of approximately 46.4 billion dollars to equity markets from the beginnig of the year until May, there is an outflow of around 4.3 billion dollars in bond markets. In June capital flows amounted to 9.2 billion dollars in total of which 8.3 billion dollars were inflows to equity markets.
Inflation Developments
5.    Although consumer inflation decreased by 45.92 points compared to the peak reached in October 2022, it still maintains its high level. Consumer prices inched up by 0.04% in May, and annual inflation decreased by 4.09 points from 43.68% to 39.59%. Recent indicators point to an increase in the underlying trend of inflation. The strong course of domestic demand, exchange rate developments and the stickiness of services inflation have been the main drivers.
6.    Contributions of subgroups to annual inflation rose from 14.62 points to 15.17 points in the services group (0.55 points of increase); rose from 9.80 points to 10.17 points in the core goods group (0.37 points of increase); dropped from 1.81 points to 1.50 points in the total of alcohol, tobacco and gold groups (0.31 points of decrease); dropped from 14.22 points to 13.64 points in the food and non-alcoholic beverages group (0.58 points of decrease); dropped from 3.24 points to -0.88 points in the energy group (4.12 points of decrease).
7.    Food prices edged up by 0.71% in May, while annual inflation fell by 1.40 points from 53.92% to 52.52%. The seasonally adjusted monthly rate of increase in food prices decreased compared to the previous month. While the rise in red meat prices decelerated in this period, seasonally adjusted data pointed to an increase in the prices of fresh fruits and vegetables in May, being more pronounced in vegetables. Volatilities in the prices of fresh fruits and vegetables keep the domestic food prices-driven risks alive. Processed food prices registered an uptick by 1.08% in monthly terms. Excluding processed meat products, price movements were moderate across the group, while the deceleration of the price increase in bread and cereals continued in May.
8.    Energy prices fell significantly by 21.00% in May, and annual inflation in this group declined by 28.16 points from 21.19% to -6.97%. The impact of free natural gas use on the group’s prices was the main driver of this development. While prices receded across the group on account of the favorable outlook for international energy prices, fuel prices were another item that stood out with a noticeable decline.
9.    Services prices rose by 4.60% in May, pushing the group’s annual inflation up by 1.33 points from 58.62% to 59.95%. In this period, annual inflation decreased in transport, while it increased in other subgroups. Restaurants-hotels and rents were the leading subgroups driving the monthly price hike in this group, with their price increases of 7.10% and 5.15%, respectively. The rise in the prices of the other services subgroup was mainly driven by the maintenance and repair of transport vehicles, which is sensitive to exchange rate developments, as well as items with a strong backward indexation tendency such as education and health services.
10.    Prices of core goods were up by 3.90% in May, and annual inflation increased by 0.91 points from 34.16% to 35.07%. In May, annual inflation increased in the durable goods and clothing-footwear subgroups, while it decreased in other core goods. Durable goods prices (excluding gold) increased by 3.48% month-on-month, with automobiles coming to the fore with a price increase of 6.37%. Automobile prices display a strong uptrend amid the outlook for the Turkish lira and brisk domestic sales. Prices in the clothing and footwear subgroup rose above historical May averages at 9.96%, which is attributed to the shift in the month of entry into the index from April to May for summer products due to a change in the methodology.
11.    The underlying trend of inflation remains elevated, despite having slowed in the post-2022 period. Seasonally adjusted monthly increases in the B and C indices gained pace compared to the previous month, which is also confirmed by alternative core inflation indicators. The three-month average rates of increase in the seasonally adjusted B and C indices, which peaked at 8.8% and 8.4%, respectively, in February 2022, declined to 2.5% and 2.8% as of May. As of May, the seasonally adjusted rates of increase in the B and C indices were 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively (2.3% and 2.6% in the previous month). Alternative core indicators such as median inflation and SATRIM also posted increases compared to the previous month.
Demand and Production
12.    Data for the second quarter of the year confirm that economic activity remained robust, particularly driven by domestic demand. Despite the earthquake-related effects, the retail sales volume index rose by 28.7% year-on-year in the first quarter. In April, the index maintained its uptrend and increased by 23.7% year-on-year. The quarterly rate of increase was 3.3% in April. The uptrend in credit card expenditures continued in the second quarter. An analysis of manufacturing firms’ registered orders in the second quarter reveals that orders from the domestic market displayed a significant rise at 2.6 points on an annual basis.
13.    Recent data show that economic activity in the earthquake zone continued to recover faster than expected, thereby largely compensating for the disaster-driven contraction. While employment growth across the country slowed in the first quarter due to the disaster, seasonally adjusted employment stood at 31.6 million in April, considerably close to its pre-disaster level of 31.7 million in January. The seasonally adjusted labor force participation rate stood at 53.9%, reaching its pre-disaster level.
14.    In April, the annualized current account deficit increased by USD 38.1 billion to USD 57.8 billion, from its April 2022 level of USD 19.7 billion, despite the decline in energy imports due to energy prices. This increase was driven by the rise in foreign trade deficit despite the strong course of the services balance. As of April, the annualized balance of payments-defined foreign trade deficit increased by USD 54.0 billion year-on-year to USD 100.2 billion. In the same period, the annualized services surplus increased by USD 14.9 billion to USD 51.6 billion. Gold imports play an important role in the widening of the current account deficit due to monetary conditions and expectations. In the first four months of the year, total gold imports increased by USD 9.2 billion year-on-year to USD 11.8 billion. Provisional foreign trade data for May indicated the continuation of the upward momentum in gold imports. The strong course of domestic demand has an increasing effect on the current account deficit through imports of consumption goods. Provisional foreign trade data for May and high-frequency data for June indicate that despite the relatively flat course of exports in seasonally adjusted terms, imports displayed an uptrend due to the above-mentioned groups.
15.    Tourism revenues are expected to make a strong contribution to the current account balance in the second half of the year, thanks to their performance beyond expectations throughout the year. Travel revenues increased by USD 2.1 billion in the first four months of the year compared to the first four months of the previous year, and reached USD 10.3 billion. Similarly, the number of foreign visitors increased by 29.2% year-on-year to 9.5 million in the first four months of the year. With the increasing contribution of tourism revenues, the current account is projected to follow a more balanced course in the second half of the year. It is anticipated that the strong course of tourism revenues, considered along with the normalization in energy imports, will contribute to healthy price formation and stability due to supply in the foreign exchange market. However, increased tourism activity poses a risk to consumer inflation by boosting demand in the short term.
16.    Despite the earthquake-related effects, annual growth of Gross Domestic Product increased to 4%, up from 3.5% in the previous quarter. In seasonally and calendar-adjusted terms, quarterly growth stood at 0.3%. Contributions to annual growth were -2.8 points from net exports, 1.2 points from investments, and 5.6 points from the rest of the consumption sector. Domestic demand made the largest contribution to annual growth, while the weak external demand and the earthquake-driven temporary production loss limited the contribution of the industrial sector to growth. Annual growth in private consumption was 16.2%, while final domestic demand growth, which includes private and public sector consumption and investment expenditures, was 12.1%. In this period, machinery-equipment investments grew by 8% on an annual basis, extending their uptrend into the fourteenth quarter.
17.    In April, the seasonally and calendar-adjusted industrial production index decreased by 0.9% month-on-month, but increased by 0.8% quarter-on-quarter, pointing to the continuation of the post-earthquake recovery trend.
Cost Conditions
18.    Global commodity prices, which started to decrease as of the second half of 2022, supported the fall in consumer inflation via the input prices channel. Meanwhile, the pressure on producer prices increases due to higher exchange rates and labor costs.
19.    The domestic producer prices index posted a mild increase by 0.65% in May due to the decrease in the energy production group, and annual producer inflation declined by 11.35 points from 52.11% to 40.76%. After a widespread decline in May, international commodity prices follow an almost flat course in June. Indicators for pressures in the global supply chain and international transportation costs remain low. With the decline in global commodity prices, current global supply conditions continue to be favorable for inflation. Meanwhile, exchange rate developments are expected to exert pressure on energy and other imported input prices in the upcoming period.
20.    The decision to provide household natural gas free of charge for full use in May and for use of 25 cubic meters for the following 11 months led to a significant slowdown in the rate of increase in consumer prices in May, decreasing inflation by 2.4 points. In the absence of additional supports, this downward effect will reverse into an upward effect on inflation in the last quarter of the year, as cold weather and consumption of energy for heating purposes come into effect.
21.    Despite the favorable course of energy prices, the outlook for sub-indices for capital goods, durable and non-durable consumption goods diverged from headline producer prices. In addition to this outlook, the depreciation in the Turkish lira, the increasing volatility in exchange rates, and the widespread rise in wages are projected to exert additional cost pressures on inflation in the short run. The pass-through from these factors to consumer prices is rapid particularly amid strong demand conditions. According to leading indicators, the exchange rate-led increases in many items in the inflation basket, durable consumption goods in particular, have started to be reflected on consumer inflation.
Stickiness of Services Inflation
22.    Price increases in the services sector remain high, and inflation in this group is stickier than in goods. The monthly price increases in the services sector, where the impact of domestic demand is stronger, remain higher than 2022. The last three month average of the seasonally adjusted consumer price increases was 2.5% in the B index and 3.7% in services. In addition, the diffusion index for the services sector hovers above its historical average, indicating that the increases spread across the sector.
23.    In addition to soaring house prices and the backward-indexation behavior, imbalances between supply and demand in the real estate market affect consumer inflation negatively by pushing rent increases upwards.
24.    In the restaurants and hotels subgroup, which is significantly affected by developments in food, wages and tourism, monthly price increases display a steady outlook.
25.    A backward-looking pricing behavior prevails in certain services items led by rents, education, health, recreation and culture, which causes inflationary effects to spread over a long period of time.
Inflation Expectations
26.    Inflation is projected to increase somewhat in 2023, and then decline as the cumulative effects of monetary tightening kick in, gradually converging first to historical averages and then to the medium-term target. Credit expansion, cost pressures and exchange rate developments indicate that pressures on inflation might increase. The current course of inflation expectations and the deterioration in pricing behavior keep the upside risks to the inflation outlook alive.
27.    According to the June results of the Survey of Market Participants: The 12-month-ahead inflation expectation increased by 0.81 points from 29.84% to 30.65%; the 24-month-ahead inflation expectation went up by 0.38 points from 17.74% to 18.12%; the five-year-ahead inflation expectation was revised downwards by 0.15 points from 8.22% to 8.07%.
Monetary and Financial Conditions
28.    Along with the monetary policy decision, the Committee made assessments regarding loan growth and lending and deposit rates. From the perspective of financial stability, sensitivity analyses were conducted and it was evaluated that banks are resilient under potential policy rate hike scenarios considered and that these potential scenarios do not threaten the safety and soundness of the banking system. 
29.    Credit growth poses a risk to inflation by increasing domestic demand. As of 16 June 2023, the retail loan balance increased by 65.7% in credit cards, 63.1% in vehicle loans, 27% in personal loans, 21.3% in housing loans compared to end-2022, amounting to an increase of 38.1% in total. Meanwhile, since the last MPC meeting period, loan growth has declined. In this development, the expansion of the scope of the loan growth-based securities maintenance practice and the increase in deposit rates due to the existing regulations have been effective.
30.    The difference between loan and deposit rates and policy rates widened in the previous MPC period. As of 16 June 2023, average personal loan (excluding overdraft accounts) rates in the sector have risen by 749 basis points to 41.7% compared to the period before the regulation. Turkish lira commercial loan rates have remained flat at 14.7%. The Turkish lira deposit rate has increased by 674 basis points to 30.3% since the previous MPC meeting period. The upward impact of the removal of the interest rate cap on FX-Protected Deposit accounts continues.
31.    Accordingly, the Committee evaluated the necessity of increasing the functionality of market mechanisms through the simplification process of the current micro and macro-prudential framework along with monetary tightening.
Monetary Policy
32.    The Committee will determine the policy rate in a way that will create monetary and financial conditions necessary to ensure a decline in the underlying trend of inflation and to reach the 5% inflation target in the medium term. Considering the inflation outlook and the upside risks, the Committee assessed that the current monetary policy was far from achieving the inflation target of 5%. The Committee underlined that deterioration in price stability was threatening macroeconomic stability and, in particular, financial stability. Accordingly, the Committee decided to implement a monetary tightening process, the steps of which will be strengthened as much as needed in a timely and gradual manner. The monetary tightening process will continue until a significant improvement in the inflation outlook is achieved.
33.    The policy rate (the one-week repo auction rate) has been increased from 8.5% to 15%. The Committee sees this decision as the first step of the monetary tightening process that was initiated to establish the disinflation course as soon as possible, to anchor inflation expectations, and to control the deterioration in pricing behavior.
34.    The Committee has evaluated analyses on the impact of the monetary tightening process on macroeconomic and financial conditions. The impact of rate hike scenarios on key macroeconomic variables such as inflation, credit growth, credit and market rates, economic activity and expectations as well as on stress tests on banks have been evaluated. The inflation outlook necessitates taking new steps to achieve the goals.
35.    Indicators of inflation and the underlying inflation trend will be closely monitored and the CBRT will continue to decisively use all the tools at its disposal in line with its main objective of price stability.
36.    The Committee concluded that inflation, which has drifted away from the target, calls for the effective use of the monetary policy. The monetary tightening process will increase the effectiveness of monetary policy.
37.    In addition, the Committee evaluated that the current micro and macro-prudential framework fell short of supporting the macro-financial stability and distorts the functionality of market mechanisms. Therefore, a simplification policy has been adopted. The existing micro- and macro-prudential framework will be simplified to increase the functionality of market mechanisms and strengthen macro-financial stability. For a smooth transition period, it was decided to implement a gradual simplification policy. The pace and sequence of transition in the simplification process will depend on impact analysis. Impact analyses of the CBRT's regulations will be conducted for all components of the framework by assessing their impact on inflation, interest rates, exchange rates, reserves, expectations, securities and financial stability.
38.    In addition, in order to be able to sustain price stability in the long-term, the CBRT will continue to support strategic investments that will improve the current account balance.
39.    The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a predictable, data-driven and transparent framework."

Press Release on Interest Rates
Participating Committee Members
Hafize Gaye Erkan (Governor), Taha Çakmak, Mustafa Duman, Elif Haykır Hobikoğlu, Emrah Şener.
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to increase the policy rate (the one-week repo auction rate) from 15 percent to 17.5 percent.
The Committee decided to continue the monetary tightening process in order to establish the disinflation course as soon as possible, to anchor inflation expectations, and to control the deterioration in pricing behavior.
While global inflation has been declining, it remains above the long-term averages and targets of central banks. As a result, many central banks continue the monetary tightening process.
In our country, recent indicators point to continuation of the increase in the underlying trend of inflation. The strong course of domestic demand, cost pressures stemming from wages and exchange rates and the stickiness of services inflation have been the main drivers. In addition to these factors, the Committee anticipates that tax regulations and the deterioration in pricing behavior will put further pressure on inflation.
Foreign direct investment, notable improvement in external financing conditions, continued increase in foreign exchange reserves and improvement in current account balance driven by rising tourism revenues will contribute significantly to price stability.
The policy rate will be determined in a way that will create monetary and financial conditions necessary to ensure a decline in the underlying trend of inflation and to reach the 5 percent inflation target in the medium term. Monetary tightening will be further strengthened as much as needed in a timely and gradual manner until a significant improvement in the inflation outlook is achieved.
To increase the functionality of market mechanisms and strengthen macro financial stability, the Committee will continue to simplify and improve the existing micro- and macroprudential framework. Guided by impact analyses, the simplification process will continue to be gradual. In this context, in addition to the increase in the policy rate, the Committee has made decisions on quantitative tightening and selective credit tightening to support the monetary policy stance.
Indicators of inflation and underlying trend of inflation will be closely monitored and the Committee will continue to decisively use all the tools at its disposal in line with its main objective of price stability.
The Committee will continue to make its decisions in a predictable, data-driven and transparent framework.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

2023,25 July 2023,Press Release on Selective Credit and Quantitative Tightening Decision,"No: 2023-28
25 July 2023
Press Release on Selective Credit and Quantitative Tightening Decision
In its decision of 20 July 2023, the Monetary Policy Committee stated that the simplification process, which would strengthen macrofinancial stability and increase the functionality of market mechanisms, would continue gradually, and that selective credit and quantitative tightening decisions were taken to support the monetary tightening process.
Within the scope of quantitative tightening to support the monetary policy stance, the reserve requirement ratio of 15% on FX-protected accounts was published in the Official Gazette dated 21 July 2023.
The following steps have been taken as part of the simplification process:

To complement the steps supporting the tightening process, it has been decided to set the monthly growth limit for TL commercial loans at 2.5%, which was previously 3% under the securities maintenance practice based on loan growth. Export, investment, agriculture and tradesmen loans are excluded from this limitation.
	 
To increase the functionality of the market mechanism, it has been decided to simplify the securities maintenance practice based on interest rates, and accordingly to remove the first tier for TL commercial loans excluding export and investment loans and to apply the interest rate cap as a single tier.
	 
To support the efficient use of financial resources, it has been decided to set the growth limit for vehicle loans at 2%, down from 3%, and to keep the 3% limit for general purpose loans unchanged. Moreover, to control inflation and to balance domestic demand, the monthly maximum interest rate applied to credit card cash utilization and overdraft accounts has been raised to 2.89%.

Export and investment loans as well as loans for the earthquake zone will be exempted from all credit restring measures of the Central Bank.
In addition to these steps, the following decisions have been taken to support exporters’ access to financing: 

The daily limit for rediscount credits has been raised to TRY 1.5 billion.
	 
The SME share in rediscount credits will be increased and export growth performance will be taken into account when extending credits.
	 
As part of the simplification process, conditions to access resdiscount credits have been facilitated. Accordingly,
	a. The requirement to sell additional 30% of export proceeds to use rediscount credits has been abolished.
b. Foreign currency purchases for import payments have been exempted from the scope of the commitment not to buy foreign currency during the rediscount credit term.

2023,27 July 2023,Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting,"No: 2023-29
27 July 2023
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 20 July 2023
Global Economy
1.    While global inflation has been declining, it remains above the long-term averages and targets of central banks. Consumer inflation in advanced and emerging economies decreased from 5.59% and 5.82% in the previous MPC meeting period to 4.91% and 5.41%, respectively. In the last ten years, the average inflation was 2.2% in advanced economies and 5.6% in emerging economies. Inflation continues to hover significantly above the average target rate of 2% in advanced economies and 3.5% in emerging economies. The average annual inflation expectation for the last quarter of 2023 for advanced and emerging economies are 3.1% and 5.9%, respectively. Although the downward trend in commodity prices that started in the middle of last year continues, the current level of the Commodity Price Index is 26.2% above the average of the last ten years. The index decreased by 28.7% compared to the highest level reached last year. Similarly, the Agricultural Commodity Price Index, which declined by 11.2% compared to the peak it reached last year, is 16.2% above the average of the last ten years. This still has an impact on inflation due to the high share of food in the consumer basket. Compared to the previous MPC meeting period, core inflation posted a limited decline from 5.12% to 5.02% in advanced economies and from 6.20% to 6.03% in emerging economies. The average annual inflation expectation for the last quarter of 2023 is 3.2% in the USA and 3.0% in the euro area, while core inflation expectations are 3.7% and 4.0%, respectively.
2.    High levels of core inflation and inflation expectations imply that global inflation will continue to remain above the targets of central banks for a while. As a result, many central banks continue the monetary tightening process. The central banks of 12 advanced countries held a total of 130 meetings in the last 17 months, and policy rates were increased in 93 of these meetings. During the same period, 15 emerging countries' central banks held a total of 190 meetings, and policy rates were increased in 97 of these meetings. (1) The results of the implemented monetary policy have begun affecting financial conditions, and central banks' emphasis on tightening financing and credit conditions has strengthened.
3.    Despite the flat global growth outlook, relatively strong demand and tight labor markets persist. The global growth index, which is weighted with export shares of Türkiye’s foreign trade partners, has posted a very limited increase compared to the previous MPC meeting period. The index is projected to grow by 1.7% in 2023, which is approximately 0.4 points higher than the trough in January. However, when the 3.5% growth of the index in 2022 is considered, a notable slowdown in foreign demand, on an annual basis, in 2023 is evident. Global PMI indices indicate that the services sector activity remains robust, while the manufacturing industry continues to follow a flat course just below the threshold value since the last quarter of last year. The global services PMI rose by 2.6 points quarter-on-quarter to 54.9 in the second quarter of the year, while the manufacturing PMI decreased by 0.2 points to 49.3. The composite PMI index was 52.7 in June with a decline of 1.7 points compared to the level in May at the global level, dropped by 1.5 points to 52.2 in advanced economies, and decreased by 2 points to 53.6 in emerging economies. While the composite PMI indicator in China fell by 3.1 points to 52.5 in June compared to May, the index was above the 50-threshold level in both the manufacturing and services sectors. Expectations for a slowdown in economic activity in advanced economies due to financial conditions continue. In the euro area, one of Türkiye's major trading partners, the manufacturing PMI fell to 43.4 in June, the lowest level since the pandemic.
4.    Portfolio flows to emerging markets continued in June on the back of improving risk sentiment. While there was an inflow of approximately USD 46.4 billion to equity markets from the beginning of the year until the end of May, there was an outflow of around USD 4.3 billion in bond markets. From the beginning of June until July 7, the portfolio inflows amounted to USD 7.6 billion in total, USD 4.9 billion of which were inflows to equity markets.
Inflation Developments
5.    Although annual inflation in Türkiye has decreased by 47.3 points compared to the peak in October 2022, it still remains high. Consumer prices rose by 3.92% in June, while annual inflation fell by 1.38 points to 38.21%. Recent indicators point to continuation of the increase in the underlying trend of inflation. The strong course of domestic demand, cost pressures stemming from wages and exchange rates, the stickiness of services inflation and tax adjustments have been the main drivers.
6.    Contributions of subgroups to annual inflation rose from 10.17 points to 10.49 points in the core goods group (0.32 points of increase) and from 1.50 points to 1.81 points in the total of alcohol, tobacco and gold groups (0.31 points of increase) but dropped from 13.64 points to 13.56 points in the food and non-alcoholic beverages group (0.08 points of decrease), from 15.17 points to 15.00 points in the services group (0.17 points of decrease) and from -0.88 points to -2.64 points in the energy group (1.76 points of decrease).
7.    Prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 3.02% in June, and annual inflation rose by 1.40 points to 53.92%. The seasonally adjusted monthly rate of increase in food prices accelerated compared to the previous month, driven by prices of fresh fruits and vegetables, mainly vegetables. In the other unprocessed food group, the rise in red meat prices gained pace compared to the previous month. Processed food prices went up by 1.85% on a monthly basis mainly due to tea prices that were driven up by fresh tea purchase prices. Monthly inflation of bread and cereals increased somewhat in this period, reaching 1.41%.
8.    Energy prices rose by 4.23% in June, and the group’s annual inflation dropped by 9.55 points to -16.52% due to the base effect. Fuel prices, which increased (11.32%) in tandem with the outlook of the Turkish lira despite the relatively flat course of international crude oil prices, were the leading driver of the monthly increase in energy prices.
9.    In June, prices of services rose by 3.66%, and the group’s annual inflation edged down by 0.50 points to 59.45%. Price hikes spread across subgroups, while rents and restaurants-hotels continued to be the subgroups standing out with their price increases of 5.80% and 4.32%, respectively. Communication prices remained on the rise led by internet fees, while increases in prices of the maintenance and repair of personal transport vehicles as well as recreation and sports services were notable in the other services subgroup. Meanwhile, the outlook for transport services was mainly shaped by the ongoing price hikes in air passenger transport.
10.    Prices of core goods were up by 4.03% in June, and annual inflation increased by 1.62 points to 36.69%. In June, annual inflation increased in durable goods (excluding gold) as well as in clothing and footwear, but decreased in other core goods. The monthly increase in durable goods (excluding gold) grew stronger with 6.64% over the previous month, mainly driven again by automobiles in June. Automobile prices surged by 10.28% due to brisk domestic sales as well as exchange rate developments. Thus, the rise in automobile prices amounted to 34.01% in the first six months of 2023. Meanwhile, prices of white goods posted an increase of 3.78% in June. 
11.    Prices in the alcoholic beverages and tobacco products group soared by 11.13%, and annual inflation in this group rose by 10.80 points to 40.90%. This was mainly driven by producer-driven price hikes in tobacco products (12.29%). The price increase in the alcoholic beverages and tobacco group will also continue in July due to the specific SCT rise that is automatically updated based on the D-PPI as well as VAT arrangement at the beginning of the month. 
12.    The underlying trend of inflation remains elevated, despite having slowed in the post-2022 period. Seasonally adjusted monthly increases in the B and C indices gained pace compared to the previous month, which is also confirmed by alternative core inflation indicators. The three-month average increases in the seasonally adjusted B and C indices, which peaked at 8.8% and 8.4%, respectively, in February 2022, declined to 2.8% and 3.3% as of June 2023. In June, the seasonally adjusted rates of monthly increase in the B and C indices were 3.1% and 3.7%, respectively (2.9% and 3.6% in the previous month). Alternative core indicators such as median inflation and SATRIM also posted increases compared to the previous month.
13.    Leading indicators for July point to a significant monthly price increase through the channels of demand, wages, exchange rates, taxes and deteriorating pricing behavior. Accordingly, it is estimated that annual inflation will also increase significantly.
Demand and Production
14.    Data for the second quarter of the year confirm that economic activity remained robust, particularly driven by domestic demand. In May, the retail sales volume index maintained its uptrend, increasing by 33.1% year-on-year. The quarterly rate of increase as of May was 4.6%. The uptrend in card expenditures continued in the second quarter, and seasonally adjusted card expenditures posted a strong increase of 24.3% compared to the first quarter. An analysis of manufacturing firms’ registered orders in the second quarter reveals that orders from the domestic market displayed a significant rise at 2.6 points on an annual basis. Leading indicators and field interviews suggest that the strong course of domestic market orders continued in July. 
15.    Recent data show that economic activity in the earthquake zone continued to recover faster than expected, thereby largely compensating for the disaster-driven contraction. As of May, seasonally adjusted employment reached 31.7 million, which was 26,000 people above its pre-disaster level in January. In this period, seasonally adjusted employment increased quarterly by 0.9%, and labor force participation rate by 0.3 points. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate decreased by 0.5 points in May from its 10% level in the previous month, hitting its lowest level since March 2014.
16.    In May, the annualized current account deficit increased by USD 37.3 billion to USD 60 billion, from its May 2022 level of USD 22.6 billion, despite the decline in energy imports due to energy prices. This increase was driven by the rise in foreign trade deficit despite the strong course of the services balance. As of May, the annualized balance of payments-defined foreign trade deficit increased by USD 49.9 billion year-on-year to USD 101.9 billion. In the same period, the annualized services surplus increased by USD 12.1 billion to USD 51.5 billion. Gold imports play an important role in the widening of the current account deficit due to monetary conditions and expectations. In the first five months of the year, total gold imports increased by USD 10.7 billion year-on-year to USD 14.6 billion. Provisional foreign trade data for June suggest that despite hovering below the May level, gold imports remain high. The strong course of domestic demand has an increasing effect on the current account deficit through imports of consumption goods. Provisional foreign trade data for June and high-frequency data for July indicate that imports remained high despite the relatively flat course of exports in seasonally adjusted terms, excluding religious holiday-related working day effects.
17.    Tourism revenues are expected to make a strong contribution to the current account balance in the second half of the year, thanks to their performance beyond expectations throughout the year. Travel revenues increased by USD 2.5 billion in the first five months of the year compared to the first five months of the previous year, and reached USD 14.1 billion. Similarly, the number of foreign visitors increased by 26.1% year-on-year to 13.6 million in the first five months of the year. With the increasing contribution of tourism revenues, the current account is projected to follow a more balanced course in the second half of the year. It is anticipated that the strong course of tourism revenues, considered along with the normalization in energy imports, will contribute to healthy price formation and stability due to supply in the foreign exchange market. However, increased tourism activity poses a risk to consumer inflation by boosting demand in the short term.
18.    In May, the seasonally and calendar-adjusted industrial production index increased by 1.1% month-on-month.  While monthly increases became widespread across sectors, they were stronger in sectors with high export shares and in those that typically exhibit high volatility. Industrial production increased by 1.4% quarter-on quarter, pointing to the continuation of the post-earthquake recovery trend. Similarly, the manufacturing industry capacity utilization rate increased by 0.9 points quarter-on-quarter to 76.2% in the second quarter, and compensated for the earthquake-induced loss in capacity utilization.
Cost Conditions
19.    Global commodity prices that have been on the decline since the second half of 2022, have supported the fall in consumer inflation through input prices channel. On the other hand, due to exchange rates and rising labor costs, pressure on producer prices has been increasing.
20.    The monthly increase of domestic producer prices at 6.50% was significantly stronger compared to recent months, while annual producer inflation decreased by 0.34 points to 40.42% due to the base effect. In June, international commodity prices declined slightly (-0.76%), while exchange rate developments were the main driver of the rise in producer prices. Price increases were broad-based across subgroups, with energy production posting the most notable rise (12.67%). Thus, the outlook for energy costs, which had been supporting the inflation outlook for a long time, reversed in this month. In this period, other subgroups that stood out with high monthly price increases were capital goods (8.02%) and intermediate goods (6.59%).
21.    In July, indicators for global supply chain pressures and international transportation costs remained low. The Global Supply Chain Pressure Index remained about one standard deviation below its historical average in June. Global commodity prices did not display a noticeable change in July. In sum, current global supply conditions remain favorable for inflation.
22.    Adjustment in the minimum wage in July 2023, accompanied by wage adjustments for civil servants and public sector workers, and wage hikes becoming broad-based are expected to feed upward pressures, particularly cost-driven impacts, on inflation in the second half of the year.
23.    The depreciation in the Turkish lira, widespread wage increases and tax adjustments are expected to place additional cost-side pressure on inflation in the near term. The pass-through from these factors to consumer prices is particularly rapid in times of strong demand conditions. In fact, leading indicators suggest that cost developments led to widespread price hikes in July.
Stickiness of Services Inflation
24.    Price increases in the services sector remain high, and inflation in this group displays inertia compared to goods. Monthly price increases in the services sector, where the domestic demand effect is more obvious, are still high compared to 2022. The average of seasonally-adjusted consumer price increases in the last three months is 2.8% in the B index, while it is 3.5% in services. Additionally, the diffusion index for the services sector is hovering above its historical average, indicating that the increases showed a generalized pattern across the sector.
25.    Monthly increases in the restaurants and hotels subgroup, which is significantly affected by food, wage and tourism developments, display a persistent outlook. The sector, which is highly sensitive to minimum wage developments, is expected to maintain its uptrend in the following months.
26.    Certain services items, particularly rents, education, health, recreation and culture, exhibit pricing behavior indexed to past consumer inflation, prompting inflationary effects to spread over a long period of time. Given the expected outlook for consumer inflation in the near term, there is a risk that inflation will remain high for an extended period in groups in which backward-indexation is prevalent.
27.    Fuel prices are capable of having a significant impact on consumer prices, particularly on transport services, through both production inputs and transportation costs. The recent significant increase in fuel prices driven by exchange rates, crude oil prices and tax hikes is likely to have a significant impact on transport services prices in the upcoming period.
Tax Adjustments
28.    The Committee anticipates that tax regulations will put further pressure on inflation in the short run. However, it is assessed that the impact of tax hikes will be temporary and will be offset to some extent by favorable effects on demand and fiscal discipline.
29.    VAT rates were raised by 2 points in July. Additionally, the VAT rate on some cleaning products was raised to 20% from 8%. The higher fiscal multiplier due to the VAT increase in tobacco products led to high price increases.
30.    The lump-sum SCT amounts on fuel were increased. The lump-sum SCT increase of TRY 5 for gasoline and diesel, and TRY 4 for LPG will have a negative impact on consumer inflation both directly and indirectly. 
Inflation Expectations
31.    The current course of inflation expectations and the deterioration in pricing behavior keep upside risks to the inflation outlook alive. The headline inflation diffusion index was about two standard deviations above its historical average in June.
32.    According to the July results of the Survey of Market Participants, the 12-month-ahead inflation expectation increased by 2.56 points from 30.65% to 33.21%, the 24-month-ahead inflation expectation rose by 0.92 points from 18.12% to 19.04%, and the five-year-ahead inflation expectation was revised upwards by 0.79 points from 8.07% to 8.86%.
33.    Consumer inflation is projected to rise somewhat in 2023, and then decline as the cumulative effects of interest rate increases and quantative tightening kick in, gradually converging first to historical averages and then to the medium-term target.
Monetary and Financial Conditions
34.    Credit growth poses a risk to inflation by increasing domestic demand. As of 14 July 2023, the retail loan balance increased by 81.1% in credit cards, 68.7% in vehicle loans, 30.6% in personal loans, and 22.1% in housing loans compared to end-2022, amounting to an increase of 44.6% in total. Meanwhile, since the last MPC meeting period, personal loan growth has lost further momentum, increasing by 2.9% from 16 June. This was driven by the expansion of the scope of the loan growth-based securities maintenance practice. On the other hand, growth remains robust in credit cards with an annual growth rate rising from 175.4% to 186.6%. TL commercial loans remained relatively flat with a decline in annual growth rates from 73.8% to 69.1%.
35.    Average personal loan rates (excluding ODA), which increased by 749 basis points to 41.7% in the previous MPC meeting period compared to the pre-regulation times, rose by 644 basis points to 48.1% in the last MPC meeting period. Housing and vehicle loan rates increased from 21.8% and 34% to 32.6% and 41.3%, respectively in the same period. Meanwhile, Turkish lira commercial loan rates increased by 1,054 basis points to 25.2% due to the policy rate hike.
36.    TL deposit rates, which rose to 32.9% on June 23, declined despite the 650 basis points increase in the policy rate and stood at 27.8% on 14 July. The spread between the policy rate and TL deposit rates narrowed notably. This was mainly driven by the regulation on securities maintenance practice, which is the first step of the simplification process in the micro and macroprudential framework.
37.    Foreign direct investment, notable improvement in external financing conditions, continued increase in foreign exchange reserves and improvement in current account balance driven by rising tourism revenues will contribute significantly to price stability.
38.    With the recently-signed agreements, foreign direct investments that will focus on improving technology investments and production capacity will support external financing in the upcoming period.
39.    Türkiye's 5-year CDS premium, which peaked this year with 703 basis points on 22 May 2023 amid domestic uncertainties, declined to 493 basis points in the previous MPC meeting period and to 457 basis points on 19 July 2023. Similarly, 1-month and 12-month exchange rate volatilities of the Turkish lira, which were 25.2 and 33.8 points in the previous MPC meeting period declined to 23.6 and 30.3 points, respectively. Falling figures in the risk premium and exchange rate volatilities were accompanied by net portfolio inflows totaling USD 1.42 billion since June, USD 0.09 billion of which went to the GDDS market and USD 1.33 billion to the equity market.
40.    International reserves of the CBRT have assumed a strong upward trend since June. Having declined from USD 128.8 billion at the end of 2022 to USD 98.5 billion at the end of May, gross international reserves of the CBRT rose to USD 113.1 billion as of 14 July.
Monetary Policy
41.    The policy rate will be determined in a way that will create monetary and financial conditions necessary to ensure a decline in the underlying trend of inflation and to reach the 5% inflation target in the medium term. The Committee assessed that the capacity of the monetary policy framework to achieve the 5% inflation target should be enhanced in view of the inflation outlook and upside risks. The Committee drew attention to the risks that a deterioration in price stability may pose to macroeconomic stability and financial stability, in particular. Accordingly, the Committee decided to continue the monetary tightening process, the steps of which are strengthened as much as needed in a timely and gradual manner. The monetary tightening process is envisaged to be further strengthened until a significant improvement in the inflation outlook is achieved.
42.    The Committee decided to continue the monetary tightening process initiated in order to establish the disinflation course as soon as possible, to anchor inflation expectations, and to control the deterioration in pricing behavior. In this context, the policy rate (the one-week repo auction rate) was increased from 15% to 17.5%.
43.    It is assessed that the inflation outlook necessitates a sustained monetary tightening. The Committee reviewed analyses on the effects of monetary tightening on macroeconomic and financial conditions. The effects of rate hike scenarios on key macroeconomic variables such as inflation, loan growth, loan and market rates, economic activity and expectations were assessed from a holistic perspective.
44.    In addition, the Committee reiterated that the current micro- and macroprudential framework should be improved to foster macrofinancial stability and increase the functionality of market mechanisms. Accordingly, the simplification policy in this framework has been maintained. The existing micro- and macroprudential framework will be simplified to increase the functionality of market mechanisms and strengthen macrofinancial stability. The simplification policy will continue to be gradual. In the simplification process, the pace and sequence of the steps depend on impact analyses. Impact analyses of the CBRT's regulations are conducted from a holistic perspective for all components of the framework, including its impacts on inflation, interest rates, exchange rates, reserves, expectations, securities and financial stability.
45.    In this context, in addition to the increase in the policy rate, the Committee has made decisions on quantitative tightening and selective credit tightening to support the monetary policy stance. While policy rates, the main policy instrument, affect monetary and financial conditions and expectations, these decisions aim to stabilize excess Turkish lira liquidity and consumption demand and increase the effectiveness of monetary policy.
46.    The categories of personal credits, credit cards and vehicle loans have been increasing by 9.8% and 9.1% on a monthly average since early 2023. With this acceleration in retail loans, it is assessed that domestic demand deteriorates price stability both directly and through the current account balance. Selective credit tightening decisions are projected to support the rebalancing process in domestic demand.
47.    The Turkish lira liquidity inflows to the financial system stemming from the foreign exchange difference payments of FX-protected deposit accounts due to the exchange rate developments are closely monitored. Due actions will be taken based on the impact analyses in view of the current market conditions and liquidity projections for the upcoming period. According to the quantitative tightening decision, the CBRT planned to sterilize the excess liquidity in the market by raising the Turkish lira reserve requirement ratios for FX-protected deposit accounts.
48.    Indicators of inflation and the underlying inflation trend will be closely monitored and the CBRT will continue to decisively use all the tools at its disposal in line with its main objective of price stability.
49.    The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a predictable, data-driven and transparent framework.

Press Release on FX-Protected Accounts
The Monetary Policy Committee stated in its decision of 20 July 2023 that the simplification process will continue in a gradual manner to strengthen macro financial stability and increase the functionality of market mechanisms.
As part of the simplification process, it has been decided to end the implementation that stipulates a target for conversion from foreign currency deposits to FX-protected deposits as well as the securities maintenance and reserve requirement practice based on the Turkish lira share.
The regulations are intended to increase Turkish lira deposits while decreasing FX-protected deposits by ensuring transition from FX-protected accounts to Turkish lira deposits.
Thus, the objective is to contribute to strengthening macro financial stability by supporting Turkish lira time deposits. In this scope, it has been decided to 

Targeting for conversion from accounts with FX-protection provided by the Central Bank to Turkish lira accounts and for renewal of FX-protected accounts at a certain ratio,
Targeting increment for the share of Turkish lira accounts without FX protection. 

The simplification process and the steps regarding the transition from FX-protected deposits to Turkish lira deposits will continue in line with the principles announced by the Monetary Policy Committee.

Press Release on Interest Rates
Participating Committee Members
Hafize Gaye Erkan (Governor), Osman Cevdet Akçay, Elif Haykır Hobikoğlu, Yaşar Fatih Karahan, Hatice Karahan.
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to raise the policy rate (the one-week repo auction rate) from 17.5 percent to 25 percent.
The Committee decided to continue the monetary tightening process in order to establish the disinflation course as soon as possible, to anchor inflation expectations, and to control the deterioration in pricing behavior.
Recent indicators point to a continued increase in the underlying trend of inflation. The strong course of domestic demand, cost pressures stemming from wages and exchange rates, stickiness of services inflation and tax regulations have been the main drivers. In addition to these factors, also driven by the rise in oil prices, higher-than-anticipated deterioration in inflation expectations and in pricing behavior implies a year-end inflation close to the upper bound of the forecast range provided in the Inflation Report (Report). However, given the monetary tightening stance, the Committee still anticipates that disinflation will be established in 2024 in line with the Report.
Foreign direct investment, improvement in external financing conditions, continued increase in foreign exchange reserves, and the positive impact of tourism revenues on current account balance will contribute significantly to price stability.
The policy rate will be determined in a way that will create monetary and financial conditions necessary to ensure a decline in the underlying trend of inflation and to reach the 5 percent inflation target in the medium term. Monetary tightening will be further strengthened as much as needed in a timely and gradual manner until a significant improvement in the inflation outlook is achieved.
To increase the functionality of market mechanisms and strengthen macro financial stability, the Committee will continue to simplify and improve the existing micro- and macroprudential framework. Guided by impact analyses, the simplification process will continue to be gradual. In this context, recent regulations targeting a rising share of Turkish lira deposits will strengthen the monetary transmission mechanism. In addition to the increase in the policy rate, the Committee will continue to make decisions on quantitative tightening and selective credit tightening to support the monetary policy stance.
Indicators of inflation and underlying trend of inflation will be closely monitored and the Committee will continue to decisively use all the tools at its disposal in line with its main objective of price stability. 
The Committee will continue to make its decisions in a predictable, data-driven and transparent framework.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
2023,31 August 2023,Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting,"No: 2023-33
31 August 2023
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 24 August 2023
Global Economy
1.    Global inflation has recently been declining, yet it remains above the long-term averages and central bank targets. Consumer inflation in advanced economies decreased from 4.91% to 4.08% over the intermeeting period, whereas consumer inflation in emerging economies increased from 5.41% to 5.84% due to relatively large economies such as Russia, Türkiye and India. In the last ten years, inflation averaged 2.2% in advanced economies and 5.6% in emerging economies. Inflation continues to hover significantly above the average target rate of 2% in advanced economies and 3.5% in emerging economies. The average annual inflation expectation for the last quarter of 2023 for advanced and emerging economies are 3.1% and 6.2%, respectively. Compared to the previous MPC meeting period, core inflation declined from 5.02% to 4.74% in advanced economies, while it remained flat at 6.03% in emerging economies. The average annual inflation expectation for the last quarter of 2023 is 3.1% in the USA and 3.0% in the euro area, while core inflation expectations are 3.6% and 4.1%, respectively.
2.    Commodity prices have recently been rising due to energy commodity prices led by oil prices. The current level of the Commodity Price Index is 30.6% above the average of the last ten years. The index fell 26.2% compared to the highest level reached last year. Similarly, the Agricultural Commodity Price Index, which declined by 10.9% compared to the peak it reached last year, is 16.6% above the average of the last ten years. This still has an impact on inflation due to the high share of food in the consumer basket.
3.    High levels of core inflation and inflation expectations imply that global inflation will continue to remain above the targets of central banks for a while. As a result, many central banks around the world continue the monetary tightening process. The central banks of 12 advanced countries held a total of 138 meetings in the last 18 months, and policy rates were increased in 97 of these meetings. (1)   During the same period, 15 emerging countries' central banks held a total of 205 meetings, and policy rates were increased in 100 of these meetings. The results of the implemented monetary policy have begun affecting financial conditions, and central banks' emphasis on tightening financing and credit conditions has strengthened. On the other hand, the central banks of Brazil and Chile, which initiated their rate hike cycles with early and strong steps and implemented them decisively in a period when inflation started to rise, began to cut rates on the back of the decline in consumer inflation. However, given the high levels of inflation and the central banks’ policy communications, it is expected that the tightness of monetary policy will continue in these economies. 
4.    Despite the flat global growth outlook, relatively strong demand and tight labor markets continue. The global growth index, which is weighted with export shares of Türkiye’s foreign trade partners, has posted a very limited increase compared to the previous MPC meeting period. The index is projected to grow by 1.8% in 2023, which is approximately 0.5 points higher than the trough in January. However, when the 3.5% growth of the index in 2022 is considered, a notable slowdown in foreign demand, on an annual basis, in 2023 is evident. Having fallen in June, global PMI declined further in July. In July, the global manufacturing industry PMI remained unchanged at 48.7 over the previous month, while the global services PMI decreased by 1.2 points to 52.7. Thus, the global composite PMI index was down by 1 point to 51.7 in July compared to the previous month. In July, the composite PMI data of both advanced and emerging economies receded. The composite PMI indicator for China remained on the decline in July, falling by 0.7 points to 51.9. The manufacturing PMI dropped by 1.3 points to 49.2, below its threshold value, while the services PMI was relatively flat at 54.1. In the euro area, one of Türkiye's major trading partners, the composite PMI indicator declined further in August, falling by 1.6 points to 47. In August, the manufacturing PMI was up by 1 point to 43.7, only to reach one of the lowest levels since June 2020 when the first wave of the pandemic was experienced. The services PMI, in particular, remained on the decline in August and fell by 2.6 points to 48.3, below its threshold.  
5.    Portfolio flows to emerging markets continued in June on the back of improving risk sentiment. While there was an inflow of approximately USD 54.2 billion to equity markets in the first half of 2023, there was an outflow of around USD 2.4 billion from bond markets. From the beginning of July until 11 August, the portfolio inflows amounted to USD 3 billion in total, USD 1.3 billion of which were inflows to equity markets.
Inflation Developments
6.    Although annual inflation in Türkiye has decreased by 37.7 points compared to the peak in October 2022, it started to rise again. Consumer prices rose by 9.49% in July, and annual inflation increased by 9.62 points to 47.83%. Recent indicators point to a continued increase in the underlying trend of inflation. The strong course of domestic demand, cost pressures stemming from wages and exchange rates, stickiness of services inflation and tax regulations have been the main drivers of this development. The increase fuel inflation due to exchange rates and international developments also had an additional effect on the increase in inflation through direct and indirect channels and contributed to its widespread diffusion. In fact, leading indicators suggest that widespread price hikes occurred also in August following the large increases in July.
7.    Contributions of subgroups to annual inflation rose from 15.00 points to 17.85 points in the services group (2.86 points of increase), from 10.49 points to 12.95 points in the core goods group (2.46 points of increase), from -2.64 points to -0.39 points in the energy group (2.25 points of increase), from 13.56 points to 15.27 points in the food and non-alcoholic beverages group (1.71 points of increase), and from 1.81 points to 2.15 points in the total of alcohol, tobacco and gold groups (0.34 points of increase).
8.    Prices of food and nonalcoholic beverages group increased by 7.71% in July, and annual inflation rose by 6.80 points to 60.72%. Price increases were widespread across the food group. The seasonally adjusted monthly rate of increase in food prices accelerated compared to the previous month, which was again driven by prices of fresh fruits and vegetables. In the other unprocessed food group, red meat, nuts and potatoes were noteworthy. Processed food prices went up by 6.08% on a monthly basis. While this was mainly driven by bread and cereals, tea prices continued to rise due to fresh tea purchase prices. Having dropped in recent months, prices of milk and dairy products started to rise again in this period. 
9.    Energy prices rose by 12.73% in July, and the group’s annual inflation increased by 13.66 points to -2.86%. Monthly energy inflation was driven by the fuel item, which posted a price hike of 29.04%. Coupled with international crude oil prices and exchange rate developments, the SCT adjustment brought about a significant increase in fuel prices. While fuel prices had surged by 57.35% from early May to the previous MPC meeting, they recorded an additional increase of 14.34% from that period to 23 August. In addition to its direct effect, the increase in fuel prices also has an indirect negative effect on consumer inflation through transportation costs.
10.    Services prices rose by 9.81% in July, and the group’s annual inflation surged by 10.20 points to 69.65%. Strong price hikes spread across the group, and annual inflation increased in all subgroups. In July, the minimum wage adjustment and the ongoing negative outlook for food prices as well as strong tourism demand led to an 11.92% rise in restaurants-hotels. Due to the minimum wage hike and exchange rate developments, prices in the other services subgroup were up by 10.27%. In other services, the maintenance and repair of personal transport vehicles and health services came to the forefront. Significant increases in fuel prices adversely affected transport services, pushing subgroup prices up by 10.03%. The monthly price increase in the rents subgroup strengthened somewhat in July and was measured at 7.67%. The price increase in communication services was more limited compared to other subgroups with 3.74%.   
11.    Prices of core goods were up by 9.40% in July, and the group’s annual inflation increased by 7.56 points to 44.25%. In July, annual inflation increased across all subgroups, most notably in durable goods. Following the depreciation of the Turkish lira, tax and wage increases as well as buoyant demand conditions, the monthly price increase in durable goods (excluding gold) grew stronger with 12.49% over the previous month, led again by automobiles in July. A similar trend was also observed in other core goods, and the subgroup prices rose by 8.73% due to widespread increases. 
12.    Prices in the alcoholic beverages and tobacco products group soared by 11.17%, and annual inflation in this group rose by 5.68 points to 46.58%. This was mainly driven by tax adjustments. The VAT increase as well as the reflection of the producer price increase in the first half of the year on specific and minimum specific taxes pushed prices upwards across the group.
13.    The underlying trend of inflation increased markedly in July. Seasonally adjusted monthly increases in the B and C indices rose significantly compared to the previous month, which is also confirmed by alternative core inflation indicators. The three-month average increases in the seasonally adjusted B and C indices, which peaked at 8.8% and 8.4%, respectively, in February 2022, stood at 5.1% and 5.7% as of July 2023. In July, the seasonally adjusted rates of increase in the B and C indices were measured at 9.2% and 9.8%, respectively (3.2% and 3.6% in the previous month). 
14.    Leading indicators suggest that the significant monthly price increases coming through the channels of demand, wages, exchange rates, taxes and deteriorating pricing behavior will also continue in August. Accordingly, it is estimated that annual inflation will also increase significantly.
Demand and Production
15.    Data for the second quarter of the year confirm that economic activity remained robust, particularly driven by domestic demand. In June, the retail sales volume index maintained its uptrend, increasing by 23.2% year-on-year, while the quarterly rate of increase was 5.2%. The uptrend in card expenditures also continued in July, and seasonally adjusted expenditures by domestic cards posted a strong increase of 12% on a monthly basis. An analysis of manufacturing firms’ registered orders in July reveals that orders from the domestic market displayed a significant rise at 8.4 points on an annual basis. Leading indicators suggest that the strong course of domestic market orders is maintained in August. Interviews with firms, on the other hand, point to slight loss of momentum at the sectoral level due to the high rate of price increases.
16.    In June, the seasonally and calendar adjusted industrial production index increased by 1.6% month-on-month, while it rose by 2.3% quarter-on quarter, indicating that the earthquake-driven production losses were compensated for. Similarly, the seasonally adjusted manufacturing industry capacity utilization rate increased by 0.3 points month-on-month to 76.9% in July, the highest level in the last ten months. Leading indicators for August also suggest that this outlook for the manufacturing industry continues. Recent data show that economic activity in the earthquake zone continued to recover faster than expected, thereby largely compensating for the disaster-driven contraction.
17.    As of June, seasonally adjusted employment increased by 0.5% quarter-on-quarter to 31.5 million, exceeding the average quarterly employment level before the disaster. In this period, the labor force participation rate remained flat at 53.4% while the unemployment rate decreased by 0.3 points to 9.7%, hitting its lowest level since the second quarter of 2014. High-frequency data indicate that demand remains robust in the labor market. 
18.    In June, in line with the improvement in the foreign trade deficit, the annualized current account deficit decreased by USD 3.3 billion monthly to USD 56.5 billion. This decrease was driven by the strong course of the services balance and the ongoing fall in energy prices over the previous year as well as the notable decline in imports in June. As of June, the annualized balance of payments-defined foreign trade deficit widened by USD 42.5 billion year-on-year to USD 99.3 billion. In the same period, the annualized services surplus rose by USD 9.6 billion to USD 51.9 billion. Gold imports, which have increased due to monetary conditions and expectations, play an important role in the widening of the current account deficit. According to provisional foreign trade data for July, gold imports increased by USD 12.5 billion year-on-year to USD 19.4 billion in the first seven months of the year. Effects of the measures taken to reduce the acceleration in gold imports which is critical for the course of the current account deficit in 2023 are closely monitored. The strong course of domestic demand has an increasing effect on the current account deficit through imports of consumption goods. Provisional foreign trade data for July indicate that exports declined in July due to the bringing forward of deliveries ahead of the religious holiday, while imports of all subgroups of goods, led by consumption goods in particular, recorded increases outpacing the declines in June. On the other hand, high-frequency data for August imply that imports remained relatively flat as against the recovery in exports in seasonally adjusted terms. 
19.    Tourism revenues, which have been above expectations throughout the year, continue to contribute positively to the current account balance. Travel revenues increased by USD 3.3 billion in the first six months of the year compared to the same period of the previous year, and reached USD 18.9 billion. Similarly, the number of foreign visitors increased by 22.9% year-on-year to 18.8 million in the first half of the year.
Cost Conditions
20.    While global commodity prices that have been on the decline since the second half of 2022 have supported the fall in consumer inflation through the input prices channel, price increases in the energy subgroup have been notable recently. These price increases have not been limited to crude oil but have also been observed in propane, butane and coal.  Excluding the energy subgroup, international commodity prices remained flat in July, while the general index rose by 4.41%. In this period, exchange rates and rising labor costs stood as the main factors exerting pressure on producer prices.
21.    The monthly increase of domestic producer prices at 8.23% was higher compared to the previous month, while annual producer inflation rose by 4.08 points to 44.50%. In this period, capital goods (11.67%), durable consumption goods (10.37%), and intermediate goods (8.93%) were the subgroups that stood out with high monthly price increases.
22.    In August, indicators for global supply chain pressures have remained mild while international transportation costs have increased. The Global Supply Chain Pressure Index remained about one standard deviation below its historical average in July as well. While commodity prices excluding energy have declined somewhat in August, increases in the energy subgroup push the general index upwards as in July.
23.    Adjustment in the minimum wage in July 2023, accompanied by wage adjustments for civil servants and public sector workers, and wage hikes becoming broad-based are expected to strengthen the upward pressures, particularly cost-driven impacts, on inflation in the second half of the year.
24.    The depreciation in the Turkish lira, widespread wage increases and tax adjustments are expected to continue to exert cost-side pressure on inflation in the near term. The pass-through from these factors to consumer prices is particularly strong in times of deteriorating inflation expectations.
Stickiness of Services Inflation
25.    Price increases in the services sector, which remained high in the first half of the year, further strengthened as of July. Monthly price increases in the services sector, which displays inertia compared to goods, are high compared to 2022. The average of seasonally-adjusted consumer price increases in the last three months is 5.1% in the B index, while it is 5.7% in services. Additionally, the diffusion index for the services sector is hovering significantly above its historical average, indicating that the increases showed a generalized pattern across the sector.
26.    Monthly increases in the restaurants and hotels subgroup, which are significantly affected by food, wage and tourism developments, display a persistent outlook. Given the recent developments in the minimum wage and food prices, the sector is expected to maintain its upward trend in the following months.
27.    Certain services items, particularly rents, education, health, recreation and culture exhibit pricing behavior indexed to past consumer inflation, prompting inflationary effects to spread over a long period of time. Given the expected outlook for consumer inflation in the near term, there is a risk that inflation will remain high for an extended period in items in which backward-indexation is prevalent.
28.    Fuel prices are capable of having a significant impact on consumer prices, particularly on transport services, through both production inputs and transportation costs. The recent significant increase in fuel prices driven by exchange rates, crude oil prices and tax hikes is likely to continue to exert pressure on transport services prices in the upcoming period.
Tax Adjustments
29.    The Committee anticipates that tax regulations will put further pressure on inflation in the short run. However, it is assessed that the impact of tax hikes will be temporary and will be offset to some extent by favorable effects on demand and fiscal discipline.
30.    The impact of the VAT rate hike in July on prices is expected to extend into August due to the number of days calculated and in the coming months depending on the frequency of price changes by firms, albeit at a weaker pace. 
31.    The lump-sum SCT amounts on fuel were increased. The lump-sum SCT increase has a negative impact on consumer inflation both directly and indirectly. As the tax hikes coincided with exchange rate developments and the rise in international crude oil prices, indirect effects, particularly on transportation services and food items, have been realized rapidly. Recently, while price hikes in administered transportation services have become more frequent, it is assessed that the rise in prices of fresh fruits and vegetables contrary to the seasonal averages was also induced by fuel-driven developments.
Inflation Expectations
32.    Shocks such as tax and administered price increases, minimum wage regulation and exchange rate developments, which are considered temporary during normal inflation periods, may have longer-lasting negative effects on expectations and inflation inertia than expected in a high inflation environment. In addition to these factors, higher-than-anticipated deterioration in inflation expectations and pricing behavior due to the factors affecting inflation as well as the rise in oil prices in July and beyond keep upside risks to the inflation outlook alive. The headline inflation diffusion index displayed a more unfavorable outlook in July and was about three standard deviations above its historical average. 
33.    According to the August results of the Survey of Market Participants, the 12-month-ahead inflation expectation increased by 8.80 points from 33.21% to 42.01%, the 24-month-ahead inflation expectation rose by 3.50 points from 19.04% to 22.54%, and the five-year-ahead inflation expectation was revised upwards by 1.56 points from 8.86% to 10.42%.
34.    It is anticipated that, at the end of the year, inflation will hover close to the upper bound of the forecast range provided in the Inflation Report (Report) and then, given the monetary tightening stance, disinflation will be established in 2024 in line with the Report.
Monetary and Financial Conditions
35.    Credit growth poses a risk to inflation by increasing domestic demand. As of 18 August 2023, the retail loan balance increased by 93.7% in credit cards, 74.6% in vehicle loans, 31.7% in personal loans, and 23.6% in housing loans compared to end-2022, amounting to an increase of 49.3% in total. Meanwhile, since the last MPC meeting period, personal loan growth has lost further momentum, increasing by 0.8% from 14 July. This was driven by the expansion of the scope of the loan growth-based securities maintenance practice. In the same period, although its growth slowed down to 7%, personal credit cards maintained its strong trend, and its annual growth remained flat at 184.2%. For Turkish Lira denominated commercial loans, which grew by 3% compared to the previous MPC period, annual growth stood at 63.5%.
36.    Average personal loan rates (excluding ODA), which had been trending flat since the previous MPC period, became 47.1% as of 18 August 2023. In the same period, housing loan rates increased from 32.6% to 36.4% and vehicle loan rates decreased from 41.3% to 38.1%. Meanwhile, Turkish lira commercial loan rates increased by 632 basis points to 31.3% as the first tier for TL commercial loan was removed and the policy rate was increased.
37.    As of June, the measures taken to ensure the sound functioning of the banking system within the scope of the simplification process have primarily restored the flow of Turkish lira commercial loans. Turkish lira commercial loans, which increased by 0.3% across the sector in June, grew 2.4% in July. Turkish lira deposit rates, which started to decline in this period, stood at 24.9% in the week ending August 18. Owing to the policy rate hike and the recent steps taken as part of the simplification of the macroprudential framework, it is expected that the demand for Turkish lira instruments will increase, loan rates and deposit rates will rise concurrently and the monetary transmission mechanism will be strengthened.
38.    Foreign direct investments, improvement in external financing conditions, continued increase in foreign exchange reserves, and the positive impact of tourism revenues on current account balance will contribute significantly to price stability.
39.    With the recently-signed agreements, foreign direct investments that will focus on improving technology investments and production capacity will support external financing in the upcoming period.
40.    Türkiye's 5-year CDS premium, which peaked this year with 703 basis points on 22 May 2023 amid domestic uncertainties, declined to 457 basis points in the previous MPC meeting period and to 412 basis points on 23 August 2023. Similarly, 1-month and 12-month exchange rate volatilities of the Turkish lira, which were 23.6 and 30.3 points in the previous MPC meeting period declined to 15.2 and 28.5 points, respectively. Falling figures in the risk premium and exchange rate volatilities were accompanied by net portfolio inflows totaling USD 2.23 billion since June, USD 0.48 billion of which went to the GDDS market and USD 1.75 billion to the equity market.
41.    International reserves of the CBRT have assumed a strong upward trend since June. Having declined from USD 128.8 billion at the end of 2022 to USD 98.5 billion at the end of May, gross international reserves of the CBRT rose to USD 117.1 billion as of 18 August 2023.
Monetary Policy
42.    The policy rate will be determined in a way that will create monetary and financial conditions necessary to ensure a decline in the underlying trend of inflation and to reach the 5 percent inflation target in the medium term. The Committee assessed that because of the inflation outlook and the upside risks, the capacity of the monetary policy framework to achieve the 5% inflation target should be enhanced. The Committee drew attention to the risks that a deterioration in price stability may pose to macroeconomic stability and especially to financial stability. Monetary tightening will be further strengthened as much as needed in a timely and gradual manner until a significant improvement in the inflation outlook is achieved.
43.    The Committee decided to continue the monetary tightening process in order to establish the disinflation course as soon as possible, to anchor inflation expectations, and to control the deterioration in pricing behavior. Therefore, the Committee has decided to raise the policy rate (the one-week repo auction rate) from 17.5% to 25%.
44.    To increase the functionality of market mechanisms and strengthen macro financial stability, the Committee will continue to simplify and improve the existing micro- and macroprudential framework.  A gradual simplification policy will continue to be implemented, and the pace and sequence of the transition will continue to be determined through impact analyses. Impact analyses of the CBRT's regulations are conducted for all components of the framework by assessing their impact on inflation, interest rates, exchange rates, reserves, expectations, securities and financial stability.
45.    In this context, recent regulations targeting a rising share of Turkish lira deposits will strengthen the monetary transmission mechanism. In addition to the increase in the policy rate, the Committee will continue to make decisions on quantitative tightening and selective credit tightening to support the monetary policy stance. While policy rates, the main policy instrument, affect monetary and financial conditions and expectations, these decisions aim to stabilize excess Turkish lira liquidity and consumption demand and increase the effectiveness of monetary policy.
46.    With the acceleration in retail loans, it is assessed that domestic demand is deteriorating price stability both directly and through the current account balance. Selective credit tightening decisions are expected to support the rebalancing process in domestic demand.
47.    The Turkish lira liquidity inflows to the financial system stemming from the foreign exchange difference payments of FX-protected deposit accounts due to the exchange rate developments are closely monitored. Due actions will be taken based on the impact analyses in view of the current market conditions and liquidity projections for the upcoming period.
48.    Indicators of inflation and underlying trend of inflation will be closely monitored and the Committee will continue to decisively use all the tools at its disposal in line with its main objective of price stability. 
49.    The Committee will continue to make its decisions in a predictable, data-driven and transparent framework.

Press Release on Interest Rates
Participating Committee Members
Hafize Gaye Erkan (Governor), Osman Cevdet Akçay, Elif Haykır Hobikoğlu, Yaşar Fatih Karahan, Hatice Karahan.
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to raise the policy rate (the one-week repo auction rate) from 25 percent to 30 percent.
The Committee decided to continue the monetary tightening process in order to establish the disinflation course as soon as possible, to anchor inflation expectations, and to control the deterioration in pricing behavior.
Inflation readings were above expectations in July and August. As the strong course of domestic demand and the stickiness of services inflation persist, the increase in oil prices and the ongoing deterioration in inflation expectations pose additional upside risks to inflation. These factors imply a year-end inflation close to the upper bound of the forecast range provided in the Inflation Report (Report). The Committee evaluated that tax regulations and cost pressures stemming from wages and exchange rates, which have been pushing up inflation, have broadly passed through to prices, and that the underlying trend in monthly inflation is on course to decline. Given the monetary tightening stance, the Committee is determined to establish the disinflation course in 2024 in line with the Report.
Foreign direct investment, improvement in external financing conditions, continued increase in foreign exchange reserves, the positive impact of tourism revenues on current account balance, and increasing domestic and foreign demand for Turkish lira denominated assets will contribute significantly to price stability.
The policy rate will be determined in a way that will create monetary and financial conditions necessary to ensure a decline in the underlying trend of inflation and to reach the 5 percent inflation target in the medium term. Monetary tightening will be further strengthened as much as needed in a timely and gradual manner until a significant improvement in the inflation outlook is achieved.
To increase the functionality of market mechanisms and strengthen macro financial stability, the Committee continues to simplify and improve the existing micro- and macroprudential framework. Guided by impact analyses, the simplification process will continue to be gradual. In this context, recent regulations targeting a rising share of Turkish lira deposits strengthen the monetary transmission mechanism. In addition to the increase in the policy rate, the Committee will continue to make decisions on quantitative tightening and selective credit tightening to support the monetary policy stance.
Indicators of inflation and underlying trend of inflation will be closely monitored and the Committee will continue to decisively use all the tools at its disposal in line with its main objective of price stability. 
The Committee will continue to make its decisions in a predictable, data-driven and transparent framework.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

2023,28 September 2023,Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting,"No: 2023-37
28 September 2023
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 21 September 2023
Global Economy
1.    Global inflation has recently been declining, yet it remains above the long-term averages and central bank targets. In August, consumer inflation posted a slight increase in many economies due to energy prices, while core inflation continued to decrease, with some exceptions such as China and Russia. Since the last Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, consumer inflation has increased from 4.08% to 4.27% in advanced economies and from 5.84% to 6.48% in emerging economies. In the last ten years, inflation averaged 2.2% in advanced economies and 5.6% in emerging economies. Inflation continues to hover significantly above the average target rate of 2% in advanced economies and 3.5% in emerging economies. The average annual inflation expectations for the last quarter of 2023 for advanced and emerging economies are 3.2% and 6.5%, respectively. Compared to the previous MPC meeting period, core inflation declined from 4.74% to 4.57% in advanced economies, whereas it rose from 6.03% to 6.57% in emerging economies. Average annual inflation expectations for the last quarter of 2023 are 3.1% in the USA and 3.3% in the euro area, while core inflation expectations are 3.5% and 4.3%, respectively.
2.    Commodity prices continue to increase recently due to energy commodity prices led by oil prices. The current level of the Commodity Price Index is 31.8% above the average of the last ten years. The index fell by 25.5% compared to the highest level reached last year. Similarly, the Agricultural Commodity Price Index, which has declined by 12.3% compared to the peak it reached last year, is 14.8% above the average of the last ten years. This still has an impact on inflation due to the high share of food in the consumer basket.
3.    High levels of core inflation and inflation expectations imply that global inflation will continue to remain above the targets of central banks for a while. As a result, many central banks around the world are expected to continue to keep their policy rates at levels that will maintain the tightness of the monetary stance. The central banks of 12 advanced countries held a total of 145 meetings in the last 19 months, and policy rates were increased in 100 of these meetings(1). During the same period, 15 emerging countries' central banks held a total of 213 meetings, and policy rates were increased in 101 of these meetings. The results of the implemented monetary policy have begun affecting financial conditions, and central banks' emphasis on tightening financing and credit conditions has strengthened. On the other hand, following the central banks of Brazil and Chile, which initiated rate cut cycles earlier on the back of the decline in consumer inflation, the central banks of Poland and Peru also reduced their policy rates in September. However, given the high levels of inflation and the central banks’ policy communications, it is expected that the tightness of monetary policy will continue in these economies.
4.    Despite the flat global growth outlook, relatively strong demand and tight labor markets persist. The global growth index, which is weighted with export shares of Türkiye’s foreign trade partners, remained flat compared to the previous MPC meeting period. The index is projected to grow by 1.7% in 2023, which is approximately 0.4 points higher than the trough in January. However, when the 3.5% growth of the index in 2022 is considered, a notable slowdown in foreign demand, on an annual basis, in 2023 is evident. Having fallen in June and July, global Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) declined further in August. In August, the global manufacturing industry PMI edged up by 0.4 points to 49 points over the previous month, while the global services PMI decreased by 1.6 points to 51.1. Thus, the global composite PMI index was down by 1 point to 50.6 in August compared to the previous month. With the exeption of Japan, the PMI data for advanced economies continued to deteriorate in August. The composite PMI indicator for the euro area, one of the important trade partners of Türkiye, decreased by 1.9 points to 46.7 in August. Despite an increase of 0.8 points in August, the manufacturing PMI stood at 43.5, recording one of the lowest levels since June 2020. The services PMI, in particular, remained on the decline in August and decreased by 2.9 points to 47.9, which is below its threshold value. This indicates that the slowdown in euro area’s economic activity will also continue in the second half of the year. The manufacturing industry PMI of emerging economies rose month-on-month by 1.2 points to 51.4 in August while the services PMI dropped by 1.5 points to 53.1. In the Chinese economy, the composite PMI maintained its downward trend in August and dropped by 0.2 points to 51.7. The manufacturing industry PMI exceeded its threshold value by increasing 1.8 points to 51, while the services PMI fell by 2.4 points to 51.8. These developments suggest that the services sector, which was an important driving force of global economic activity in the first half of the year, has lost strength in recent months.
5.    Portfolio flows to emerging markets continued in June and July on the back of improving risk sentiment. While there was an inflow of approximately USD 63.2 billion to equity markets in the first seven months of 2023, bond markets saw an inflow of around USD 1.1 billion. In August (31 July-1 September 2023), driven by the fluctuation in global risk appetite, there was a total outflow of USD 22.1 billion, USD 20.5 billion of which was from equity markets, mainly from China, Taiwan, South Africa and Indonesia.
Inflation Developments
6.    Inflation readings were above expectations in July and August. As the strong course of domestic demand and the stickiness of services inflation persist, the increase in oil prices and the ongoing deterioration in inflation expectations pose additional upside risks to inflation. Consumer prices rose by 9.09% in August, and annual inflation increased by 11.11 points to 58.94%. This was due to the carry-over effects of tax and administered price adjustments from July, the lagged effects of the depreciation in the Turkish lira and wage increases, as well as the rise in global energy prices and the stickiness of services prices. The high level of fuel prices due to frequent price revisions had an additional impact on the rise in inflation through direct and indirect channels, and contributed to widespread price hikes.
7.    Contributions of subgroups to annual inflation rose from 17.85 points to 20.86 points in the services group (3.00 points of increase), from 15.27 points to 18.13 points in the food and non-alcoholic beverages group (2.86 points of increase), from 12.95 points to 15.54 points in the core goods group (2.60 points of increase), from -0.39 points to 2.11 points in the energy group (2.51 points of increase), and from 2.16 points to 2.30 points in the total of alcohol, tobacco and gold groups (0.14 points of increase).
8.    Prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages group increased by 8.48% in August, and annual inflation rose by 12.14 points to 72.86%. Seasonally adjusted data pointed to a significant increase in prices of fresh fruits and vegetables in this period, with fruit prices in the lead. In the other unprocessed food group, increases in prices of eggs as well as dried fruits and nuts were notable. The monthly price increase in the processed food group grew stronger at 11.17% compared
to the previous month. Bread and cereals, bread in particular, as well as milk and dairy products, fats and oils, and non-alcoholic beverages posted noticeable price hikes.
9.    Energy prices went up by 14.23% in August, and the group’s annual inflation rose by 16.89 points to 14.03%. Monthly energy inflation was driven by the carry-over effect of the tax increase in mid-July as well as soaring international energy prices. Fuel and bottled gas prices surged by 26.11% and 23.93%, respectively. Coupled with international crude oil prices and exchange rate developments, the SCT adjustment brought about a significant increase in fuel prices. In addition to its direct effect, the increase in fuel prices also has an indirect negative effect on consumer inflation through transportation costs. Municipal water prices also posted a sharp increase (7.43%) in August.
10.    The increase in services prices remained strong at 9.19% in August, and annual services inflation rose by 9.92 points to 79.57%. In this period, price hikes spread across the subgroups, and annual inflation increased in all subgroups. Prices of transport services posted their highest increase in the 2003-based index with a monthly hike of 27.62% due to the drastic rise in fuel prices. Large price increases in transport services also continued in September, albeit with some loss of momentum. The continued significant price increases in the restaurants-hotels subgroup, driven by the ongoing negative outlook for food prices as well as strong tourism demand and the lagged effects of wage hikes, continued in August and prices surged by 7.09%. The monthly price increase in the rents subgroup strengthened somewhat further and was measured at 7.90%. In the other services subgroup, prices increased by 7.19%, led by maintenance-repair of personal transport vehicles, health services and recreation-culture services. The price increase in communication services was higher at 5.14% compared to past months.
11.    Prices of core goods were up by 8.57% in August, and the group’s annual inflation increased by 7.72 points to 51.97%. For core goods, where the exchange rate pass-through is high, prices increased sharply across subgroups, while annual inflation rose in all subgroups. The monthly price increase in durable goods (excluding gold) remained strong at 7.82%, with significant increases in prices of automobiles, white goods and furniture in August. In the other core goods subgroup, the carry-over effects of tax adjustments and revision of the reference euro exchange rate for medicine prices were felt, and prices posted a widespread increase of 9.92%. In the clothing and footwear group, prices rose (8.25%) contrary to the seasonal averages.
12.    Prices in the alcoholic beverages and tobacco group increased by 3.77%, and annual inflation in this group rose by 5.40 points to 51.98%. This development was mainly due to the carry-over effects into August as the price hikes stemming from last month's tax adjustments were reflected in the index on a day-weighted basis. The rise in tobacco prices will continue in September as well due to the price adjustments by producer companies.
13.    The underlying trend of inflation remained elevated in August. Seasonally adjusted monthly increases in the B index slightly rose while that in the C index remained flat. This outlook is also confirmed by alternative core inflation indicators. The three-month average increases in the seasonally adjusted B and C indices, which peaked at 8.8% and 8.5%, respectively, in February 2022, stood at 7.0% and 7.2% in August 2023. In August, the seasonally adjusted rates of increase in the B and C indices were measured at 9.8% and 9.2%, respectively.
14.    Leading indicators suggest that the high price hikes over the last two months will decelerate.  Preliminary data suggest that the rise in food prices has lost pace compared to previous months, while the lagged effects of wages, exchange rates and taxes on inflation have weakened significantly. Meanwhile, services prices remain elevated due to seasonal factors related to the opening of schools, and the impact of rising oil prices on energy items continues. 
Demand and Production
15.    Gross Domestic Produc (GDP) data for the second quarter of the year suggest that the economic activity remained robust, particularly driven by domestic demand. Recent indicators and high-frequency data point that, in the third quarter, economic activity maintained its strength led by domestic demand, despite a quarterly slowdown in growth momentum. In July, the retail sales volume index displayed a significant rise of 34.8% year-on-year, due to calendar effects. Following the 5.8% rise in the second quarter, the quarterly rate of increase lost some momentum and came down to 3.9%. The upward trend in card expenditures continued in August. In August, manufacturing firms’ registered orders from the domestic market increased by 8.6 points on an annual basis, while, in seasonally adjusted terms, they displayed a limited decrease on a quarterly basis. Manufacturing firms’ expectations in August for future export orders and domestic market orders declined on a monthly basis, more markedly in expectations for export orders. Meanwhile, interviews with firms point to a loss of momentum at the sectoral level due to the effect of high rates of price increases on the purchasing power.
16.    In July, the seasonally and calendar adjusted industrial production index decreased by 0.4% month-on-month, while, adjusted for calendar effects, it increased by 7.4% on an annual basis. The underlying trend in industrial production is stronger when sectors typically exhibiting high volatility, such as computers, other transportation and recorded media, are excluded. Excluding these sectors, industrial production in July is stronger than the general index, with a 0.9% month-on-month increase. On a quarterly basis, industrial production increased by 0.9% in July compared to the second quarter average. In August, the seasonally adjusted capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing industry decreased, led by the vehicles sector due to the annual shutdown in factories for maintenance purposes. Meanwhile, indicators for the third quarter suggest that excluding the vehicles sector, capacity utilization rate remained flat on a quarterly basis.
17.    As of July, seasonally adjusted employment was recorded at 31.7 million. In this period, employment increased by 0.3% quarter-on-quarter, while the labor force participation rate decreased by 0.1 points. In July, unemployment rate decreased by 0.2 points to 9.4% from 9.6% in June. High-frequency data indicate that demand remains robust in the labor market.
18.    In July, in line with the significant rise in foreign trade deficit, the annualized current account deficit increased by USD 2 billion month-on-month to USD 58.5 billion. Despite the improvement in the energy balance owing to the ongoing decline in energy prices on an annual basis, this increase was mainly driven by strong increases in imports of gold, investment goods and consumption goods. In this context, the strong course of domestic demand has an increasing effect on the annualized current account deficit through imports of consumption goods. As of July, the annualized balance of payments-defined foreign trade deficit widened by USD 37.7 billion year-on-year to USD 100.6 billion. In the same period, the annualized services surplus rose by USD 7.3 billion to USD 51.7 billion. According to provisional foreign trade data for August, compared to the same period last year, gold imports increased by USD 13.5 billion to USD 22.8 billion in the first eight months of the year. High-frequency data suggest that gold imports, which accelerated in August, are still above historical averages, despite some slowdown in September on the back of the measures taken. Provisional foreign trade data for August and high-frequency data for September imply a decline in both imports and exports in seasonally and calendar adjusted terms in the August-September period.
19.    Tourism revenues, which have been strong throughout the year, continue to contribute positively to the current account balance. Travel revenues increased by USD 3.8 billion in the first seven months of the year compared to the same period of the previous year, and reached USD 24.3 billion. Similarly, the number of foreign visitors increased by 19.2% year-on-year to 25.1 million in the first seven months of the year.
Cost Conditions
20.    The increase observed in July in energy commodity prices, which had been decreasing since the second half of 2022, continued in August as well. Non-energy commodity prices, which have remained almost flat in recent months, posted a decline in August. As of the first half of September, energy commodity prices continued to rise, while non-energy commodity prices remained relatively flat. Following the decision to continue production cuts, the price of Brent crude oil maintained its upward trend and hovered above USD 90 in the first half of September, marking the highest level since November 2022.  In the energy group, international propane and butane as well as coal prices continued to increase in USD terms. Thus, exchange rates and international energy commodity developments as well as the lagged effects of rising labor costs stood as the main factors exerting pressure on producer prices.
21.    In August, domestic producer prices rose by 5.89%, pushing annual inflation up by 4.91 points to 49.41%. According to the main industrial groupings, annual inflation increased across all subgroups, while the monthly increase in energy producer prices was significant due to international commodity and exchange rate developments.
22.    The Global Supply Chain Pressure Index remained flat in August while international transportation costs maintained their low levels despite a slight increase. Exchange rates, which retreated after the MPC decision in August, remained stable in September.
23.    Adjustment in the minimum wage in July 2023, accompanied by wage adjustments for civil servants and public sector workers, and wage hikes becoming broad-based had important impacts on inflation in July and August through the cost channel.
Stickiness of Services Inflation
24.    Price increases in the services sector became stronger as of July.  Monthly price increases in the services sector, which displays inertia compared to goods, are higher compared to 2022. Annual inflation in the C index, which includes the core goods and services groups, is around 65%, while annual inflation in the services sector is around 80%. Additionally, the diffusion index for the services sector is hovering approximately 60% above its historical average, indicating that the increases showed a generalized pattern across the sector.
25.    Monthly increases in the restaurants and hotels subgroup, which are significantly affected by food, wage and tourism developments, display a persistent outlook. Given the weakening in lagged effects of the minimum wage and the recent deceleration in food price increases, the uptrend in prices in the sector is expected to lose some momentum in the following months.
26.    Fuel prices are capable of having a significant impact on consumer prices, particularly on transport services, through both production inputs and transportation costs. In fact, the recent significant increases in fuel prices driven by exchange rates, crude oil prices and tax hikes have rapidly passed through to transport services prices. The outlook for international oil prices is likely to continue to exert pressure on transport services prices in the upcoming period.
27.    In addition to rising house prices and backward-indexation behavior, imbalances between supply and demand in the real estate market are pushing rent increases upwards and adversely affectting consumer inflation.
28.    Certain services items, particularly rents, education, health, recreation and culture exhibit pricing behavior indexed to past consumer inflation, prompting inflationary effects to spread over a long period of time. Given the expected outlook for consumer inflation in the near term, there is a risk that inflation will remain high for an extended period in items in which backward-indexation is prevalent.
29.    Seasonal effects will be apparent on services prices due to the opening of schools in September. This period sees high price hikes as service items such as university tuition fees, student accomodation fees and school bus fares are priced at certain times of the year (time-dependent pricing).
Tax Adjustments
30.    The short-run effects of the recent tax adjustments on consumer inflation were observed in July and August, along with the carry-over effects arising from the number of days calculated.
31.    The direct effects of the tax hikes have largely played out. In the coming months, the indirect effects of the tax hikes are expected to continue, albeit at a weaker pace, depending on the frequency of price changes by firms.
Inflation Expectations
32.    The current course of inflation expectations and the deterioration in pricing behavior keep upside risks to the inflation outlook alive. The consumer inflation diffusion index continued to rise in August, remaining three standard deviations above its historical average.
33.    According to the September results of the Survey of Market Participants, the 12-month-ahead inflation expectation increased by 2.93 points from 42.01% to 44.94%, the 24-month-ahead inflation expectation rose by 1.33 points from 22.54% to 23.87%, and the five-year-ahead inflation expectation was revised downwards by 0.39 points from 10.42% to 10.03%.
34.    These factors imply a year-end inflation close to the upper bound of the forecast range provided in the Inflation Report (Report). The Committee evaluated that tax regulations and cost pressures stemming from wages and exchange rates, which have been pushing up inflation, have broadly passed through to prices, and that the underlying trend in monthly inflation is on course to decline. Given the monetary tightening stance, the Committee is determined to establish the disinflation course in 2024 in line with the Report.
Monetary and Financial Conditions
35.    Credit growth poses a risk to inflation by increasing domestic demand. As of 8 September 2023, the retail loan balance increased by 107.7% in credit cards, 75.8% in vehicle loans, 34.0% in personal loans, and 24.2% in housing loans compared to end-2022, amounting to an increase of 54.4% in total. Meanwhile, personal loan growth, which lost momentum due to the expansion of the scope of the loan growth-based securities maintenance practice, increased by 1.8% since 18 August. In the same period, although their growth slowed down to 6.9%, personal credit cards maintained their strong trend, with an annual growth rate remaining flat at 181.6%. For Turkish lira-denominated commercial loans, which grew by 1.3% compared to the previous MPC meeting period, annual growth stood at 61.3%.
36.    Average personal loan rates (excluding overdraft accounts), which, due to the policy rate hike, have posted a significant increase of 1,260 basis points since the previous MPC meeting period, became 59.7% as of 8 September 2023. In the same period, vehicle loan rates rose from 38.1% to 46.5%, and housing loan rates rose from 36.4% to 38.9%. Meanwhile, Turkish lira commercial loan rates increased by 931 basis points to 40.6%.
37.    As of June, the measures taken to ensure the sound functioning of the banking system within the scope of the simplification process have primarily restored the flow of Turkish lira commercial loans. Turkish lira commercial loans, which increased by 0.3% across the sector in June, grew 2.4% in July and 2% in August. Turkish lira deposit rates stood at 24.9% in the week ending 18 August and at 31.6% in the week ending 8 September. Owing to the policy rate hike and the recent steps taken as part of the simplification of the macroprudential framework, it is evaluated that there was a growth in the demand for Turkish lira investments. Simultaneously, loan and deposit rates also rose in tandem, resulting in the strengthening of the monetary transmission mechanism.
38.    Foreign direct investment, improvement in external financing conditions, continued increase in foreign exchange reserves, the positive impact of tourism revenues on current account balance, and increasing domestic and foreign demand for Turkish lira denominated assets will contribute significantly to price stability.
39.    With the recently-signed agreements, foreign direct investments that will focus on improving technology investments and production capacity will support external financing in the upcoming period.
40.    Türkiye's five-year CDS premium, which peaked this year with 703 basis points on 22 May 2023 amid domestic uncertainties, declined to 412 basis points in the previous MPC meeting period and to 385 basis points on 20 September 2023. Similarly, one-month and 12-month exchange rate volatilities of the Turkish lira, which declined noticeably in the same period remained flat in this MPC meeting period at 15.7 and 28.9 points, respectively. Falling figures in the risk premium and exchange rate volatilities were accompanied by net portfolio inflows totaling USD 2.47 billion since June, USD 0.81 billion of which went to the government domestic debt securities (GDDS) market and USD 1.66 billion to the equity market.
41.    International reserves of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) maintain the strong upward trend they assumed in June. Having declined from USD 128.8 billion at the end of 2022 to USD 98.5 billion at the end of May, gross international reserves of the CBRT rose to USD 120.6 billion as of 8 September 2023.
Monetary Policy
42.    The policy rate will be determined in a way that will create monetary and financial conditions necessary to ensure a decline in the underlying trend of inflation and to reach the 5% inflation target in the medium term. The Committee assessed that because of the inflation outlook and the upside risks, the capacity of the monetary policy framework to achieve the 5% inflation target should be enhanced. The Committee drew attention to the risks that a deterioration in price stability may pose to macroeconomic stability and especially to financial stability. Monetary tightening will be further strengthened as much as needed in a timely and gradual manner until a significant improvement in the inflation outlook is achieved.
43.    The Committee decided to continue the monetary tightening process in order to establish the disinflation course as soon as possible, to anchor inflation expectations, and to control the deterioration in pricing behavior. Accordingly, the Committee raised the policy rate (the one-week repo auction rate) from 25% to 30%.
44.    To increase the functionality of market mechanisms and strengthen macro financial stability, the Committee continues to simplify and improve the existing micro- and macroprudential framework. A gradual simplification policy will continue to be implemented, and the pace and sequence of the transition will continue to be determined through impact analyses. Impact analyses of the CBRT's regulations are conducted for all components of the framework by assessing their impact on inflation, interest rates, exchange rates, reserves, expectations, securities and financial stability.
45.    In this context, recent regulations targeting a rising share of Turkish lira deposits strengthen the monetary transmission mechanism. In addition to the increase in the policy rate, the Committee will continue to make decisions on quantitative tightening and selective credit tightening to support the monetary policy stance. While policy rates, the main policy instrument, affect monetary and financial conditions and expectations, these decisions aim to stabilize excess Turkish lira liquidity and consumption demand and increase the effectiveness of monetary policy.
46.    With the acceleration in retail loans, it is assessed that domestic demand is deteriorating price stability both directly and through the current account balance. Selective credit tightening decisions are expected to support the rebalancing process in domestic demand. The Committee assesses that the rebalancing in domestic demand resulting from credit tightening decisions and the the improvement in the distribution of financing sources will have a positive impact on factor productivity.
47.    The Turkish lira liquidity inflows to the financial system stemming from the foreign exchange difference payments of FX-protected deposit accounts due to the exchange rate developments are closely monitored. Due actions will be taken based on the impact analyses in view of the current market conditions and liquidity projections for the upcoming period.
48.    Indicators of inflation and underlying trend of inflation will be closely monitored and the Committee will continue to decisively use all the tools at its disposal in line with its main objective of price stability.
49.    The Committee will continue to make its decisions in a predictable, data-driven and transparent framework.

Press Release on Interest Rates
Participating Committee Members
Hafize Gaye Erkan (Governor), Osman Cevdet Akçay, Elif Haykır Hobikoğlu, Yaşar Fatih Karahan, Hatice Karahan.
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to raise the policy rate (the one-week repo auction rate) from 30 percent to 35 percent.
The Committee decided to continue the monetary tightening process in order to establish the disinflation course as soon as possible, to anchor inflation expectations, and to control the deterioration in pricing behavior.
In the third quarter, inflation readings were above expectations. The pass-through from tax regulations and cost pressures stemming from wages and exchange rates, which have been recently impactful, has been largely completed. The strong course of domestic demand, the stickiness of services inflation, and the deterioration in inflation expectations continue to put upward pressure on inflation. In this framework, while the year-end inflation is projected to be close to the upper bound of the forecast range provided in the Inflation Report (Report), it is also evaluated that the underlying trend in monthly inflation is on course to decline. On the other hand, geopolitical developments pose risks to the inflation outlook due to oil prices. Through the monetary tightening process, the Committee is determined to establish the disinflation course in 2024 in line with the Report.
Foreign direct investment, stable course of external financing conditions, continued increase in foreign exchange reserves, the positive impact of rebalancing in demand on current account balance, and the increase in domestic and foreign demand for Turkish lira denominated assets will significantly contribute to price stability.
The policy rate will be determined in a way that will create monetary and financial conditions necessary to ensure a decline in the underlying trend of inflation and to reach the 5 percent inflation target in the medium term. Monetary tightening will be further strengthened as much as needed in a timely and gradual manner until a significant improvement in inflation outlook is achieved.
To increase the functionality of market mechanisms and strengthen macro financial stability, the Committee continues to simplify and improve the existing micro- and macroprudential framework. Guided by impact analyses, the simplification process is advancing gradually. In this context, monetary transmission mechanism will be further strengthened by taking additional steps to increase the share of Turkish lira deposits. In addition to the increase in the policy rate, the Committee will continue to make decisions on quantitative tightening and selective credit tightening to support the monetary policy stance.
Indicators of inflation and underlying trend of inflation will be closely monitored and the Committee will continue to decisively use all the tools at its disposal in line with its main objective of price stability.
The Committee will continue to make its decisions in a predictable, data-driven and transparent framework.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
2023,27 October 2023,Press Release on the Simplification of the Macroprudential Framework,"No: 2023-40
27 October 2023
Press Release on the Simplification of the Macroprudential Framework
In its decision of 26 October 2023, the Monetary Policy Committee announced that to increase the functionality of market mechanisms and strengthen macro financial stability, it continues to simplify and improve the existing micro- and macroprudential framework. The Committee also stated that guided by impact analyses, the simplification process is advancing gradually, and in this context, monetary transmission mechanism will be further strengthened by taking additional steps to increase the share of Turkish lira deposits. 
Accordingly, the Bank has decided to proceed with the following simplification steps: 

The securities maintenance practice applied to banks at a rate of 30 percent based on the Turkish lira denominated cash loans they extend is terminated. Likewise, the types of loans excluded from this practice will no longer be subject to the securities maintenance in case they are not extended against expenditure.
The securities maintenance practice applied at a rate of 30 percent on securities issued by the real sector and purchased by banks is terminated.
The securities maintenance practice that banks are subject to for Turkish lira commercial loans based on the interest rate/dividend rate that banks apply above 1.8 times the reference rate will be abolished.
The securities maintenance practice that factoring companies are subject to for factoring receivables based on the interest rate that these companies apply above 2.7 times the reference rate is ended.
Access to export loans will be facilitated by exempting imports of investment goods from the net exporter requirement.
Articles pertaining to renewal of FX-protected deposit accounts (converted from FX accounts) and conversion to Turkish lira accounts to increase the share of Turkish lira deposits have been excluded from the securities maintenance regulation.

Meanwhile, it has been decided to take the following steps to increase the share of Turkish lira deposits:

Changes will be made to the practice of charging commissions on reserve requirements for FX deposits in order to increase the share of Turkish lira through the renewal of FX-protected accounts (converted from FX accounts) and their conversion to Turkish lira. For banks with a Turkish lira conversion rate higher than 10 percent, the portion exceeding the target will be counted towards the conversion target.
The target rise for the share of real persons’ Turkish lira deposits, which was set at 2.5 percent, will be increased to 3.5 percent.

The technical details of the decisions above will be explained in related regulations.

2023,2 November 2023,Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting,"No: 2023-42
2 November 2023
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 26 October 2023
Global Economy
1.    Global inflation has been decreasing recently, but it remains above the long-term averages and central bank targets. In September, consumer inflation was negatively affected by energy prices, while the stickiness in the core inflation trend started to wane in advanced economies. Compared to the previous Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, consumer inflation decreased from 4.27% to 3.71% in advanced economies and increased from 6.48% to 6.54% in emerging economies (1). Nevertheless, headline inflation declined in many emerging economies except some large economies such as Brazil, Russia and Turkey. Inflation continues to hover above the average target rate of 2% in advanced economies and 3.5% in emerging economies. Average annual inflation expectations for the last quarter of 2023 for advanced and emerging economies are 3.3% and 6.7%, respectively. Compared to the previous MPC meeting period, core inflation declined from 4.57% to 4.21% in advanced economies, whereas it rose from 6.57% to 7.00% in emerging economies. Average annual inflation expectations for the last quarter of 2023 are 3.3% in the USA and 3.4% in the euro area, while core inflation expectations are 3.5% and 4.1%, respectively.
2.    Despite widespread decline in commodity prices recently, geopolitical risks, financial conditions and supply-side factors lead to volatility in oil prices and a rise in natural gas prices. Brent crude oil prices per barrel have fluctuated in the range of 88-99 USD since the previous MPC meeting while the Title Transfer Facility (TTF) price, which serves as a benchmark for European natural gas prices, has increased by 31.9%. The current level of the Commodity Price Index is 30.4% above the average of the last ten years. The index fell by 26.3% compared to the highest level reached last year. Similarly, the Agricultural Commodity Price Index, which has declined by 14.5% compared to the peak it reached last year, is 11.8% above the average of the last ten years. This still has an impact on inflation due to the high share of food in consumer basket.
3.    High levels of core inflation and inflation expectations imply that global inflation will continue to remain above the targets of central banks for a while. As a result, many central banks around the world are expected to continue to keep their policy rates at levels that will maintain the tightness of the monetary stance and central banks of advanced economies are generally expected to ease more slowly and at a later pace. The central banks of 12 advanced countries held a total of 153 meetings in the last 20 months, and policy rates were increased in 102 of these meetings (2). During the same period, 15 emerging countries' central banks held a total of 225 meetings, and policy rates were increased in 103 of these meetings. The results of the implemented monetary policies have begun affecting financial conditions, and central banks' emphasis on tightening financing and credit conditions has become stronger. The recent rise in uncertainties has had a tightening effect on global financial conditions, and central banks of Thailand and Indonesia raised policy rates in September and October, respectively, emphasizing this development in their decision announcements. Meanwhile, central banks of Brazil, Peru, Poland and Chile continued with policy rate cuts on the back of the decline in consumer inflation. However, given the high levels of inflation and the central banks’ policy communications, it is expected that the tightness of monetary policy will continue in these economies.
4.    Despite the flat global growth outlook, tightness in labor markets persist. The global growth index, which is weighted with export shares of Türkiye’s foreign trade partners, remained flat compared to the previous MPC meeting period. The index is projected to grow by 1.7% in 2023, which is approximately 0.4 points higher than the lowest level in January. However, when the 3.5% growth of the index in 2022 is considered, a notable slowdown in Türkiye’s foreign demand is observed on an annual basis. Having fallen in June, July and August, global Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) significantly slowed down in September. In September, the global manufacturing industry PMI edged up by 0.1 points compared to the previous month to 49.1 points, while the global services PMI decreased by 0.3 points to 50.8. Thus, the global composite PMI index was down by 0.1 point to 50.5 in September and remained almost the same as the previous month. In September, driven by the manufacturing industry, the composite PMI for advanced economies increased by 0.2 points month-on-month to 49.7. This development was mainly driven by the slight recovery in the PMI data in September for the euro area, one of Turkey's major trade partners. However, according to the early (flash) PMI data for October, the euro area composite PMI indicator decreased by 0.6 points to 46.5. The manufacturing sector PMI indicator declined by 0.4 points to 43 in October, recording one of the lowest levels since June 2020. The services PMI, in particular, declined once again in October, decreased by 0.8 points to 47.8 and continued to hover below the threshold value. This indicates that the slowdown in euro area’s economic activity will also continue in the second half of the year. The manufacturing industry PMI of emerging economies decreased by 0.5 points compared to the previous month to 50.9 in September while the services PMI dropped by 1.2 points to 51.9. In the Chinese economy, the composite PMI maintained its downward trend in August and dropped by 0.8 points to 50.9. The manufacturing industry PMI decreased by 0.4 points to 50.6, while the services PMI fell by 1.6 points to 50.2. These developments suggest that the services sector, which was an important driving force of global economic activity in the first half of the year, has lost strength in recent months and global growth rate has slowed down to a limited extent. 
5.    Portfolio flows to emerging markets, which improved in the June-July period due to risk sentiment, turned to outflows in the August-October period. The recent portfolio outflows from emerging markets were driven by the expectation that central banks of advanced economies will maintain their tight monetary policy stance for a longer period, fluctuations in the global risk appetite and uncertainties regarding the Chinese economy. In the August-October period (31 July -13 October 2023), there was a total outflow of USD 47.7 billion, USD 43.3 billion of which was from equity markets, mainly from China, Taiwan, South Korea, Brazil, South Africa and Indonesia. 
6.    Recent developments such as rising geopolitical risks, the course of energy prices, diverging economic growth outlooks across countries, increases in US long-term interest rates and portfolio outflows from emerging markets suggest that uncertainties regarding the global economy are increasing.
Inflation Developments
7.    In the third quarter, although inflation readings were above expectations, it displayed a more positive outlook in September. The pass-through from tax regulations and cost pressures stemming from wages and exchange rates, which have been recently impactful, has been largely completed  Consumer prices rose by 4.75% in September, and annual inflation increased by 2.59 points to 61.5%. 
8.    Contributions of subgroups to annual inflation rose from 20.9 points to 22.9 points in the services group (up by 2.09 points); from 2.30 points to 2.81 points in alcohol, tobacco and gold group (up by 0.51 points); from 18.1 points to 18.4 points, the food and non-alcoholic beverages group (up by 0.32 points); from 15.5 points to 15.7 points, in the core goods group (up by 0.21 points), but decreased from 2.11 points to 1.57 points in the energy group (down by 0.54 points). 
9.    Prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages group increased by 3.32% in September, and annual inflation rose by 2.28 points to 75.1%. Price increases spread across the group, while the deceleration in price increases in bread and cereals as well as fresh fruits and vegetables compared to past months limited the monthly group inflation. Seasonally adjusted data pointed that the slowdown in fresh fruits and vegetables was driven by vegetable prices. Price hikes in eggs, sugar, nuts, milk and dairy products, fats and oils as well as red meat were notable.
10.    Energy prices went up by 3.83% in September, and the group’s annual inflation fell by 3.78 points to 10.3%. Price hikes in global markets in September, with crude oil in the lead, became the main driver of energy prices. Solid fuels, bottled gas and fuel oil stood out among the group with price increases of 6.11%, 5.93% and 4.62%, respectively. Moreover, municipal water prices remained on an upward track with an increase of 4.42%.
11.    Prices of services rose further strongly by 7.88%, and annual services inflation increased by 6.89 points to 86.5%. In September, price increases spread across the group, pushing annual inflation up across all subgroups. In this period, price hikes in associated services items were notable following the opening of schools. Prices of transport services continued to rise strongly due to the substantial rise in fuel prices, which was driven mainly by the increase of 65.4% in school bus fares in September. Monthly increases in rents strengthened further and reached 9.52%. Prices in other services increased by 8.46%, with education services being the leading item following the hike in university tuition fees of 127.7%. Monthly inflation in the restaurants-hotels subgroup was limited compared to previous months with 4.15%, led by catering services due to the slowdown in food prices, while accommodation item posted high-rated increases driven by dormitory fees.
12.    Prices of core goods were up by 2.59% in September, and the group’s annual inflation increased by 1.26 points to 53.2%. Price increases weakened across subgroups, while annual inflation receded in other core goods and rose in durable goods (excluding gold) and clothing and footwear. The monthly price increase in durable goods (excluding gold) slowed to 2.58% month-on-month, yet divergences were seen within the subgroup. In September, automobile prices remained almost flat, while price increases in white goods and furniture maintained the robust course. Price increases in other core goods were more moderate, and monthly inflation stood at 2.66%. In the clothing and footwear subgroup, prices rose by 2.51%, bringing annual inflation up to 31.4%.
13.    Prices in the alcoholic beverages and tobacco group increased by 10%, and annual inflation in this group rose by 15.2 points to 67.2%, which stem from was a company-led price hike of 11.1% in tobacco prices. 
14.    Indicators of the underlying trend of inflation weakened in September (3). Seasonally adjusted monthly increases receded both in the B and C indices in September. This outlook is also confirmed by the declining figures in Median and SATRIM indicators. The three-month average increases in the seasonally adjusted B and C indices, which peaked at 8.78% and 8.49% respectively in February 2022, stood at 7.89% and 7.88 % respectively in September 2023. In September, the seasonally adjusted rates of increase in the B and C indices were measured at 4.87% and 5.50%, respectively.
15.    Leading indicators suggest that the fall in the underlying trend of inflation, which started in September, strengthened further in October as cost shocks have been largely reflected in prices. According to preliminary data, price increases lost momentum across groups, while the positive course is notable in the prices of durable goods, while the services group exhibit higher price increases compared to other groups.
16.    The strong course of domestic demand, the stickiness of services inflation, and the deterioration in inflation expectations continue to put upward pressure on inflation. In addition, global energy prices, which started to recede from the levels they hit towards the end of September, pose a risk with a re-increase amid geopolitical problems. On the other hand, while domestic demand lost some momentum, the increase in inflation expectations slowed down.
Demand and Production
17.    Following the increase in demand for Turkish lira savings instruments due to monetary tightening, some effects of monetary transmission on demand are gradually appearing. Domestic demand indicators, price reductions in sectors such as durable goods as well as plans thereof, and orders and related expectations provide leading signals of a rebalancing in demand. Accordingly, imports have fallen and the foreign trade balance has displayed a relatively favorable outlook. 
18.    Recent indicators and high-frequency data point to a quarterly slowdown in growth momentum in the third quarter. In August, adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects, the retail sales volume index decreased by 4.7% on a monthly basis. The annual growth of the retail sales volume index fell by 14.4 points to 17.2%. Following the 5.4% rise in the second quarter, the quarterly rate of increase slowed down to 1.6%. The upward trend in card expenditures continued in September. On the other hand, in realized terms, the rise in card expenditures decelerated on a quarterly basis. In October, manufacturing firms’ registered orders from the domestic market increased by 7.5 points on an annual basis, while, in seasonally adjusted terms, they displayed a quarter-on-quarter decline in the last quarter. An analysis of the broad economic categories reveals that the decline was more pronounced in the durable goods group. In this period, manufacturing firms' expectations for future export and domestic market orders increased slightly on a quarterly basis. Interviews with firms point to a loss of momentum at the sectoral level due to the slowdown in demand for consumption goods, particularly durable goods.
19.    In August, the seasonally and calendar adjusted industrial production index decreased by 0.8% month-on-month, while, adjusted for calendar effects, it increased by 3.1% on an annual basis. On a quarterly basis, industrial production increased by 0.5% in August compared to the second quarter average. Excluding the sectors with high monthly volatility, industrial production was higher in August with a quarterly increase of 0.9%. In October, the seasonally adjusted capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing industry remained flat at 76.8% with a decline of 0.1 points.
20.    As of August, seasonally adjusted employment was recorded at 31.7 million. In this period, seasonally adjusted employment increased by 0.3% quarter-on-quarter, while the labor force participation rate decreased by 0.1 points. In August, unemployment rate decreased by 0.2 points to 9.2% from 9.4% in July. High-frequency data indicate that demand remains robust in the labor market.
21.    In August, in line with the decrease in foreign trade deficit, the annualized current account deficit fell by USD 2.1 billion month-on-month to USD 57 billion. This fall was driven by the improvement in the energy balance due to the ongoing annual decline in energy prices, despite the rise in the cumulative gold trade deficit. Provisional foreign trade data for September indicate, in seasonally adjusted terms, a moderate monthly increase in exports as against a decrease on the imports side across all subgroups of goods. The three-month average trend, considered along with the high frequency data for October, implies a limited improvement in exports and a flat course in imports as well as an annual decline. Although gold imports decreased in the September-October period, they are still above historical averages.
22.    As of August, the annual services balance surplus increased by USD 5.1 billion compared to the same period of the previous year, reaching USD 51.2 billion. Tourism revenues, which have been strong throughout the year, continue to contribute positively to the current account balance. Travel revenues increased by USD 4.1 billion in the first eight months of the year compared to the same period of the previous year, and reached USD 30.5 billion. Similarly, the number of foreign visitors increased by 15.7% year-on-year to 32.5 million in the first eight months of the year.
Cost Conditions
23.    The increase that started in July in energy commodity prices, which had been decreasing since the second half of 2022, continued in September as well. Non-energy commodity prices, which have remained almost flat in recent months, did not exhibit a significant change in September. In the first three weeks of October, commodity prices, including energy prices, were on the decline. However, Brent crude oil prices, which fell until the first week of October, are on the rise again in a highly volatile state due to the geopolitical problems. In addition to these global developments, industrial electricity and natural gas tariffs and electricity producers' natural gas tariffs were raised by 20% in early October. Thus, the lagged effects of exchange rate and rising labor costs on producer prices weakened, while energy costs increased. The recent period has seen heightened risks to global energy prices due to geopolitical developments. 
24.    In September, domestic producer prices rose by 3.40%, pulling annual inflation down by 1.97 points to 47.4%. According to the main industrial groupings, the energy group stood out with a high monthly price hike of 6.12% on the back of global energy commodity prices. Annual inflation decreased in the energy group due to the base effect, while it displayed a more limited change in other main groups. 
25.    The Global Supply Chain Pressure Index remained mild in September. Having remained almost flat after the MPC decision in September, exchange rates increased moderately in October. 
26.    Adjustment in the minimum wage in July 2023, accompanied by wage adjustments for civil servants and public sector workers, and wage hikes becoming broad-based had important impacts on inflation in the third quarter of the year, especially through the cost channel.
Stickiness of Services Inflation
27.    The services sector has posted strong price increases as of July.  Monthly price increases in the services sector, which displays significant inertia, are higher compared to 2022. Annual inflation in the C index, which includes the core goods and services groups, is around 69%, while annual inflation in the services sector is around 86%. Additionally, the diffusion index for the services sector is hovering approximately 33% above its historical average, indicating that the increases continue to spread across the sector.
28.    Seasonal effects were apparent on services prices due to the opening of schools in September. This period saw high price hikes, as services items such as university tuition fees, student accommodation fees and school bus fares are priced at a certain time of the year. The September figures are an example of the sector's ability to spread the effects of shocks over time.
29.    Fuel prices are capable of having a significant impact on consumer prices, particularly on transport services, through both production inputs and transportation costs. In fact, the recent significant increases in fuel prices driven by exchange rates, crude oil prices and tax hikes have rapidly passed through to transport services prices. Transport services recorded a strong price increase in September, led by school bus item. The unstable outlook for international crude oil prices remains a risk factor for transport services prices in the upcoming period. 
30.    Rising house prices, backward-indexation behavior, and imbalances between supply and demand in the real estate market are pushing rent increases upwards and adversely affecting consumer inflation. On the other hand, data monitored on online platforms indicate that rents in big cities have tended to slow down recently.
31.    In the restaurants and hotels subgroup that is significantly affected by food, wage and tourism developments, monthly price increases display a persistent outlook. While the weakening in lagged effects of the minimum wage remains in place, and the relative importance of food prices in the outlook for restaurant and hotel prices is increasing. 
32.    Certain services items, particularly rents, education, health, recreation and culture exhibit pricing behavior indexed to past consumer inflation, prompting inflationary effects to spread over a long period of time. Given the expected outlook for consumer inflation in the near term, there is a risk that inflation will remain high for an extended period in items in which backward-indexation is prevalent.
Inflation Expectations
33.    The current course of inflation expectations and the deterioration in pricing behavior keep upside risks to the inflation outlook alive. The consumer inflation diffusion index remained elevated in September and stood at two standard deviations above its historical average.
34.    The month-on-month increase in inflation expectations is slowing down. According to the October results of the Survey of Market Participants, the current year-end inflation expectation rose by 0.79 points from 67.22% to 68.01%, the 12-month-ahead inflation expectation increased by 0.34 points from 44.94 % to 45.28 %, the 24-month-ahead inflation expectation rose by 1.95 points from 23.87% to 25.82%, and the five-year-ahead inflation expectation was revised upwards by 1.73 points from 10.03% to 11.76%. 
35.    In this framework, while the year-end inflation is projected to be close to the upper bound of the forecast range provided in the Inflation Report (Report), it is evaluated that the underlying trend in monthly inflation is on course to decline. On the other hand, geopolitical developments pose risks to the inflation outlook due to oil prices. Through the monetary tightening process, the Committee is determined to establish the disinflation course in 2024 in line with the Report.
Monetary and Financial Conditions
36.    It is assessed that the initial impact of monetary tightening on financial indicators has started to be observed. While market interest rates have moved in tandem with the policy rate, retail loan growth has assumed a downtrend. Turkish lira deposits increased whereas FX-denominated and FX-protected deposits started to decrease.
37.    The normalization in loan growth and composition continued. As of 13 October 2023, the retail loan balance increased by 118.9% in credit cards, 77.2% in vehicle loans, 36.6% in general-purpose loans, and 23.5% in housing loans compared to end-2022, amounting to an increase of 58.9% in total. The average 4 week growth rate of retail loans, which continued to lose momentum due to monetary tightening and other steps taken, stood at 2.37% as of 13 October 2023. In the same period, average 4 week growth rates of vehicle and general-purpose loans materialized at 0,63% and 1,41%, respectively. Although personal credit cards maintained their strong trend with an average 4 week growth rate of 4,82%, it continued to slow down. On the other hand, Turkish lira-denominated commercial loans experienced an average 4 week growth rate of 2,18 in the same period.
38.    Average personal loan rates (excluding overdraft accounts), which have increased by 165 basis points since the previous MPC meeting period parallel to the rise in banks’ funding costs, became 60.5% as of 13 October 2023. Having remained flat during the same period, vehicle and housing loan rates materialized at 46.7% and 41.5%, respectively as of 13 October 2023. Meanwhile, Turkish lira commercial loan rates increased by 608 basis points to 49.3%.
39.    As of June, the measures taken to ensure the sound functioning of the banking system within the scope of the simplification process have primarily restored the flow of Turkish lira commercial loans. Turkish lira commercial loans, which increased by 0.34% across the sector in June, grew 2.38% in July, 2.26 % in August, and 2.52 % in September. Meanwhile, Turkish lira deposit rates stood at 24.9% in the week ending 18 August, at 33.5% in the week ending 15 September, and at 37.9% in the week ending 13 October. In parallel, Turkish lira deposits have started increasing while FX-protected and FX-denominated deposits have both declined. Owing to the policy rate hike and the recent steps taken as part of the simplification of the macroprudential framework, it is evaluated that there was a growth in the demand for Turkish lira denominated assest. Simultaneously, loan and deposit rates also rose in tandem, resulting in the strengthening of the monetary transmission mechanism. It is assessed that the monetary transmission mechanism has been strengthening due to the recent steps taken within the scope of the simplification process in the macroprudential framework and the increase in the demand for Turkish lira instruments with the increase in the policy rate, and the rise in loan and deposit rates together.
40.    Foreign direct investment, stable course of external financing conditions, continued increase in foreign exchange reserves, the positive impact of rebalancing in demand on current account balance, and the increase in domestic and foreign demand for Turkish lira denominated assets will significantly contribute to price stability.
41.    With the recently-signed agreements, foreign direct investments that will focus on improving technology investments and production capacity will support external financing in the upcoming period.
42.    Türkiye's five-year CDS premium, which peaked this year with 703 basis points on 22 May 2023 amid domestic uncertainties, declined to 385 basis points in the previous MPC meeting period but rose to 417 basis points as of 25 October 2023 parallel to other emerging economies due to the recently escalating geopolitical risks. 1 month and 12-month exchange rate volatilities of the Turkish lira declined by 4.8 and 1.0 points, respectively in this MPC meeting period to 11.0% and 27.9% as of 25 October 2023. Falling figures in the risk premium and exchange rate volatilities were accompanied by net portfolio inflows totaling USD 1.69 billion since June, USD 0.50 billion of which went to the government domestic debt securities (GDDS) market and USD 1.19 billion to the equity market.
43.    International reserves of the Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye (CBRT) maintain the strong upward trend they assumed in June. Having declined from USD 128.8 billion at the end of 2022 to USD 98.5 billion at the end of May, gross international reserves of the CBRT rose to USD 126.1billion as of 20 October 2023.
Monetary Policy
44.    The policy rate will be determined in a way that will create monetary and financial conditions necessary to ensure a decline in the underlying trend of inflation and to reach the 5% inflation target in the medium term. Given the inflation outlook and the upside risks, the Committee evaluated strengthening the monetary policy framework in line with the price stability objective. The Committee drew attention to the risks that high inflation may pose to macroeconomic stability and especially financial stability. Monetary tightening will be further strengthened as much as needed in a timely and gradual manner until a significant improvement in the inflation outlook is achieved.
45.    The Committee decided to continue the monetary tightening process in order to establish the disinflation course as soon as possible, to anchor inflation expectations, and to control the deterioration in pricing behavior. Accordingly, the Committee raised the policy rate (the one-week repo auction rate) from 30% to 35%.
46.    To increase the functionality of market mechanisms and strengthen macro financial stability, the Committee continues to simplify and improve the existing micro- and macroprudential framework. Guided by impact analyses, the simplification process is advancing gradually. Impact analyses of the CBRT's regulations are conducted for all components of the framework by assessing their impact on inflation, interest rates, exchange rates, reserves, expectations, securities and financial stability with a holistic approach.
47.    In this context, monetary transmission mechanism will be further strengthened by taking additional steps to increase the share of Turkish lira deposits. In addition to the increase in the policy rate, the Committee will continue to make decisions on quantitative tightening and selective credit tightening to support the monetary policy stance. While the policy rate, the main policy instrument, affect monetary and financial conditions and expectations, these decisions aim to stabilize excess Turkish lira liquidity and consumption demand and increase the effectiveness of monetary policy.
48.    The Turkish lira liquidity inflows to the financial system stemming from the foreign exchange difference payments of FX-protected deposit accounts due to the exchange rate developments are closely monitored. Due actions will be taken based on the impact analyses in view of the current market conditions and liquidity projections for the upcoming period.
49.    Indicators of inflation and underlying trend of inflation will be closely monitored and the Committee will continue to decisively use all the tools at its disposal in line with its main objective of price stability.
50.    The Committee will continue to make its decisions in a predictable, data-driven and transparent framework.

8 November 2023
Press Release on Abolishment of the Summary FX Position Reporting and Change in the Scope of the Systemic Risk Data Monitoring System
With the “Regulation Amending the Regulation on the Procedures and Principles Regarding the Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye’s Monitoring of Operations Affecting the FX Position” published in the Official Gazette No 32363 dated 8 November 2023, the foreign exchange position reporting practice, in which the firms are required to submit information to the Central Bank regarding their foreign currency assets and liabilities pursuant to Article 44 (as redrafted by Law No. 7061 of 28 November 2017) of the Central Bank Law No. 1211, has been simplified and its scope has been changed. 
In the scope of this regulation, the practice of receiving Summary FX Position Reporting from firms with a total cash and non-cash loan balance of TRY 10 million or above, which was introduced in March 2023, has been abolished.
In addition, the scope of firms for the FX position reporting under the Systemic Risk Data Monitoring System implemented since 2018 has been revised to increase the level of representation of firms in the national economy. Accordingly, the scope of firms subject to the reporting requirement, which used to cover firms with an FX loan liability of USD 15 million or above, was changed to include firms with a total cash loan balance of TRY 100 million or above on the last business day of the relevant monthly accounting period, or firms with a net sales revenue or asset size of TRY 500 million or above in the last one-year accounting period.
With the change made in the scope, it is planned to simplify the existing detailed reporting format and facilitate firms’ reporting processes.

Press Release on Interest Rates
Participating Committee Members
Hafize Gaye Erkan (Governor), Osman Cevdet Akçay, Elif Haykır Hobikoğlu, Yaşar Fatih Karahan, Hatice Karahan.
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to raise the policy rate (the one-week repo auction rate) from 35 percent to 40 percent.
Headline inflation edged down in October and remains in line with the outlook presented in the most recent Inflation Report. The existing level of domestic demand, the stickiness in services inflation, and geopolitical risks keep inflation pressures alive. On the other hand, recent indicators suggest that domestic demand has started to moderate as the monetary tightening is reflected on financial conditions. The Committee also assesses that inflation expectations and pricing behavior started to show signs of improvement. The improvement in external financing conditions, continued increase in foreign exchange reserves, positive impact of demand rebalancing on current account balance, and the increase in domestic and foreign demand for Turkish lira denominated assets contribute significantly to exchange rate stability and the effectiveness of monetary policy. In light of these developments, a decline in the underlying trend of monthly inflation is observed.
The Committee assessed that the current level of monetary tightness is significantly close to the level required to establish the disinflation course. Accordingly, the pace of monetary tightening will slow down and the tightening cycle will be completed in a short period of time. The monetary tightness will be maintained as long as needed to ensure sustained price stability.
To increase the functionality of market mechanisms and strengthen macro financial stability, the Committee continues to simplify and improve the existing micro- and macroprudential framework. While lending rates are assessed to be in line with the targeted level of financial tightness, the Committee evaluates that the regulations to increase the share of Turkish lira deposits and monetary tightening will continue to strengthen the transmission mechanism and to improve the funding composition of the banking system. In addition to policy rate decisions, the Committee will continue to make quantitative tightening decisions to support the monetary policy stance.
Taking into account the cumulative and lagged effects of monetary tightening, the Committee will continue to determine the policy decisions in a way that will create monetary and financial conditions necessary to ensure a decline in the underlying trend of inflation and to reach the 5 percent inflation target in the medium term.
Indicators of inflation and underlying trend of inflation will be closely monitored and the Committee will continue to decisively use all the tools at its disposal in line with its main objective of price stability.
The Committee will continue to make its decisions in a predictable, data-driven and transparent framework.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

2023,30 November 2023,Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting,"No: 2023-49
30 November 2023
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 23 November 2023
Global Economy
1.    Global inflation has been decreasing recently, but it remains above the long-term averages and central bank targets. Compared to the previous Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting period, consumer inflation decreased from 3.71% to 3.36% in advanced economies and from 6.54% to 6.08% in emerging economies (1). Inflation continues to hover above the average target rate of 2% in advanced economies and 3.5% in emerging economies. Average annual inflation expectations for the last quarter of 2023 for advanced and emerging economies are 3.3% and 6.7%, respectively. Compared to the previous MPC meeting period, core inflation declined from 4.21% to 3.97% in advanced economies and from 7% to 6.50% in emerging economies. Average annual inflation expectations for the last quarter of 2023 are 3.4% in the USA and 3.2% in the Euro Area, while core inflation expectations are 3.5% and 4.0%, respectively.
2.    Despite widespread decline in commodity prices recently, geopolitical risks, financial conditions and supply-side factors cause oil prices to remain volatile. Brent crude oil prices per barrel have fluctuated in the range of USD 78-90 since the previous MPC meeting while the Title Transfer Facility (TTF) price, which serves as a benchmark for European natural gas prices, has decreased moderately. The current level of the Commodity Price Index is 30% above the average of the last ten years. The index fell 26.5% from the highest level reached last year. Similarly, the Agricultural Commodity Price Index, which has declined 14.3% from the peak it reached last year, is 12.1% above the average of the last ten years. This still has an impact on inflation due to the high share of food in consumer basket.
3.    High levels of core inflation and inflation expectations imply that global inflation will continue to remain above the targets of central banks for a while. As a result, many central banks around the world are expected to continue to keep their policy rates at levels that will maintain the tightness of the monetary stance and central banks of advanced economies are generally expected to ease more slowly and at a later date. The central banks of 12 advanced countries held a total of 160 meetings in the last 21 months, and policy rates were increased in 106 of these meetings (2). During the same period, 15 emerging countries' central banks held a total of 239 meetings, and policy rates were increased in 105 of these meetings. The results of the implemented monetary policies have begun affecting financial conditions, and central banks' emphasis on tightening financing and credit conditions has become stronger. Recently, central banks of Russia and the Philippines have raised their policy rates, emphasizing the increased inflationary pressures. Meanwhile, central banks of Brazil, Peru, and Chile continued with policy rate cuts on the back of the decline in consumer inflation, while the Central Bank of Hungary also reduced its policy rate both in October and November. On the other hand, the Central Bank of Poland, which had started a rate-cut cycle earlier, underlined the potential risks that fiscal policies may create and kept the policy rate unchanged. Given the high levels of inflation and the central banks’ policy communications, it is expected that the tightness of monetary policy will continue in these economies.
4.    Despite the flat global growth outlook, tightness in labor markets persists. The global growth index, which is weighted with the export shares of Türkiye’s foreign trade partners, remained flat.  The index is projected to grow 1.7% in 2023, which is approximately 0.4 percentage points higher than the lowest level in January. However, considering the 3.5% growth of the index in 2022, a notable slowdown in Türkiye’s foreign demand is observed on an annual basis. The slowdown in the global Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) in the third quarter of the year also continued in October. In October, the global manufacturing industry PMI edged down 0.4 points on a monthly basis to 48.8, while the global services PMI decreased 0.3 points to 50.4. Thus, the global composite PMI index dropped 0.4 points over the previous month to the threshold value of 50 in October. The deterioration in the global PMI data was driven by both advanced and emerging economies. The PMI data for the services sector, which was the major driving force of global economic activity, particularly in the first half of the year, continued to decline for both sets of countriesin October. In addition, the manufacturing industry PMI of emerging economies decreased 0.8 points compared to the previous month to 50.1 in October, closely approaching the threshold value. The fact that China’s manufacturing industry PMI dropped 1.1 points to 49.5 in October played an important role in this decline. Despite increasing by 0.1 points in October over the previous month, the manufacturing industry PMI for advanced economies continued to hover below the threshold value with its level at 47.5. In October, the USA, Japan and the United Kingdom displayed a more favorable outlook than in the previous month. Likewise, the manufacturing industry PMI and services PMI for the euro area posted a limited increase in November compared to October, reaching 43.8 and 48.2, respectively. Thus, the composite PMI for the euro area remained below the threshold value in November, standing at 47.1 despite an uptick of 0.6 points. This indicates that the slowdown in Euro Area’s economic activity will also continue in the second half of the year. In the Chinese economy, the composite PMI maintained its downward trend in October and dropped 0.9 points to the threshold value of 50. These developments suggest that the services sector, which was an important driving force of global economic activity in the first half of the year, has lost strength in recent months and the global growth rate has slowed down slightly.
5.    In the August-October period (31 July-27 October 2023), which was shaped by the expectation that the central banks of advanced economies will maintain their tight monetary policy stance for a longer period, the fluctuations in the global risk appetite, and the uncertainty regarding the Chinese economy, there was a total outflow of USD 61.8 billion from emerging economies, mainly from China, Taiwan, South Korea, Brazil, South Africa and Indonesia, USD 55.8 billion of which was from equity markets. As of November, the reduced risk of the spread of the war in the Middle East to other countries as well as the strengthened market perception that the rate hiking cycles in advanced economies are coming to an end led to an increase in the risk appetite and thus, portfolio inflows to emerging economies started again. In the period 30 October to 17 November, there was an inflow of USD 6.4 billion to equity markets and USD 4.7 billion to bond markets.
6.    While geopolitical risks have partially eased recently, energy prices and US long-term interest rates declined. However, the high volatility in oil prices persists and the uncertainty about the global economy remains in place.
Inflation Developments
7.    Consumer prices rose 3.43% in October, while annual inflation decreased by 0.17 percentage points to 61.4%. Headline inflation edged down in October and remains in line with the outlook presented in the most recent Inflation Report. Meanwhile, the existing level of domestic demand, the stickiness in services inflation, and geopolitical risks keep inflation pressures alive. Despite having receded from the readings at the end of September, global energy prices remain highly volatile due to geopolitical problems.
8.    Contributions of subgroups to annual inflation rose from 22.9 percentage points to 23.4 percantage points in the services group (up by 0.43 percentage points), from 1.57 percentage points to 1.74 percentage points in the energy group (up by 0.17 percentage points), from 15.7 perccentage points to 15.8 percentage points in the core goods group (up by 0.04 percentage points), but decreased from 2.81 percentage points to 2.60 percentage points in the total of alcohol, tobacco and gold groups (down by 0.21 percentage points), and from 18.4 percentage points to 17.8 percentage points in the food and non-alcoholic beverages group (down by 0.60 percentage points).
9.    Prices of the food and non-alcoholic beverages group rose 3.20% in October, while annual inflation declined 3.15 percentage points to 72.0%. Seasonally adjusted data pointed that the prices of fresh fruits and vegetables increased to a limited extent, led by vegetable prices. Price increases remained strong in the food group excluding fresh fruits and vegetables. In October, price hikes were noteworthy in red meat, white meat, eggs, nuts, pulses, fats and oils, and coffee-tea-cocoa. Despite the strong price hikes in these items, the monthly price increase in the food group was limited by the mild increase in prices of items with a large weight such as bread and cereals, fresh fruits and vegetables, and milk and dairy products.
10.    Energy prices went up 3.62% in October, and annual energy inflation increased 1.35 percentage points to 11.6%. The limit for free use of natural gas was slightly exceeded due to seasonal conditions, and the prices reflected on the basket rose. Accordingly, the natural gas item pushed monthly headline inflation up 0.22 percentage points in October. Following the developments in crude oil prices, fuel prices fell 2.15%. Driven by the lagged effects of global commodity prices, solid fuel and bottled gas prices increased 6.91% and 4.67%, respectively. In addition, municipal water prices rose 7.92% in October and continued to affect energy prices unfavorably.
11.    Prices in the services group were up 3.83% in October, and the group’s annual inflation increased 2.19 percentage points to 88.7%. Annual inflation declined in transport services but rose in other subgroups. When rent subgroup is excluded, the increase in services group annual inflation is more limited. In the rents subgroup, in which the backward-indexation behavior is strong and the sector-specific supply-demand imbalances continue to be observed, the monthly increase was 7.91%, and annual inflation reached 100.7%. Prices in the restaurants-hotels subgroup rose 3.51%, driven by the catering services item. Fuelled by mobile phone call as well as internet fees, communication services posted a monthly price increase of 4.08%, bringing annual inflation to 57.2%. The monthly increase in prices of the other services subgroup, which was negatively affected by the education-related items in the previous month, was milder at 2.90%. Parallel to the fall in fuel prices, the price increase in transport services significantly decelerated compared to the previous month and became 1.37%. While the decline in prices of passenger transport by air and intercity passenger transport by road pushed the subgroup’s monthly inflation down, carry-over effects of school bus fares from September prevented a more favorable outlook.
12.    Annual core goods inflation dropped 0.18 percentage points to 53.1%. Across subgroups, price increases weakened significantly in durable goods, whereas they accelerated seasonally in clothing and footwear due to the transition to the new season. Annual inflation increased in clothing and footwear, but decreased in other subgroups. Prices in durable goods (excluding gold) rose somewhat by 0.43%, while automobile prices declined month-on-month for the first time in the current year, and price increases in white goods and furniture lost significant momentum. As winter loomed, prices in the clothing and footwear subgroup climbed by 14.0%, pushing annual inflation up 6.74 percentage points to 38.1%. In other core goods, prices rose 2.50%, and annual inflation edged down 0.68 percentage points to 49.4%.
13.    A decline in the underlying trend of monthly inflation is observed (3).  Seasonally adjusted monthly increases slowed both in the B and C indices in October. This outlook is also confirmed by the declining figures in Median and SATRIM indicators. The three-month average increases in the seasonally adjusted B and C indices, which peaked at 8.76% and 8.59% respectively in February 2022, stood at 5.94% and 5.85% in October 2023. In October, the seasonally adjusted rates of increase in the B and C indices were measured at 2.79% and 3.65%, respectively. The consumer inflation diffusion index declined in October, and its upward standard deviation from the historical average fell from 1.8 in September to 1.4. 
14.    Leading indicators suggest that the slowdown in the underlying trend of inflation continues in line with projections. According to preliminary data, price increases are stronger in the energy group. It is predicted that due to seasonal increase in consumption, the effect of the natural gas use above the freely-provided 25 cubic meters on measured prices will push November inflation up by 1.1 percentage points. While the durable goods subgroup is marked by low price increases or discounts, services inflation is likely to remain stickier as anticipated. 
Demand and Production
15.     Following the increase in demand for Turkish lira savings instruments due to monetary tightening, some effects of monetary transmission on demand are gradually appearing. Domestic demand indicators, price reductions in sectors such as durable goods as well as plans thereof, and orders and related expectations provide leading signals of a rebalancing in demand. Accordingly, imports have weakened and the foreign trade balance has displayed a relatively favorable outlook.
16.    Recent indicators suggest that domestic demand has started to moderate as the monetary tightening is reflected on financial conditions. In September, adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects, the retail sales volume index decreased 0.7% on a monthly basis. The decrease over the last two months was more pronounced in groups including computers, electronics, construction-related expenditure items (hardware, paint and glass), household appliances and furniture, which are more sensitive to financial conditions. The annual growth of the retail sales volume index fell 3.6 percentage points to 13.8%. Following the 5.1% rise in the second quarter, the quarterly rate of increase slowed down to 0.4%. The upward trend in card expenditures continued in October. In inflation adjusted terms, the rise in card expenditures sustained its decline on a quarterly basis. In seasonally adjusted terms, manufacturing firms’ registered orders from the domestic market decreased in the fourth quarter. An analysis of the broad economic categories reveals that the decline was more pronounced in the durable goods group. Expected price increases were lower in November than in June for those firms that were more affected by the loss of momentum in demand. In the fourth quarter, manufacturing firms' expectations for future export and domestic market orders increased slightly on a quarterly basis. Interviews with firms point to a loss of momentum at the sectoral level due to the slowdown in demand for consumption goods, particularly durable goods.
17.    In September, the seasonally and calendar adjusted industrial production index decreased 0.1% month-on-month, while, adjusted for calendar effects, it increased 4.0% on an annual basis. On a quarterly basis, industrial production increased 0.3% in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. Excluding the sectors with high monthly volatility, industrial production displayed a quarterly decrease of 0.1%. In the fourth quarter, the seasonally adjusted capacity utilization rate exhibits a limited increase.
18.    As of September, seasonally adjusted employment recorded 31.7 million. In this period, seasonally adjusted employment increased 0.4% quarter-on-quarter, while the labor force participation rate decreased 0.2 percentage points. In September, unemployment rate decreased 0.1 percentage points to 9.1% from 9.2% in August. High-frequency data indicate that demand remains robust in the labor market.
19.    In September, in line with the decrease in foreign trade deficit, the annualized current account deficit fell USD 4.9 billion from the previous month’s level to USD 51.7 billion. This fall was driven by the month-on-month decline in the cumulative gold trade deficit, the improvement in the energy balance due to the ongoing annual decline in energy prices and the moderate decrease in trade deficit excluding gold and energy. Provisional foreign trade data for October point that seasonally adjusted exports and imports posted a monthly increase. The three-month average trend, considered along with the high frequency data for November, implies a limited improvement in exports and a flat course in imports as well as an annual decline. After a decrease in September, gold imports remained flat in October-November period, but still hover above historical averages.
20.    As of September, the annual services balance surplus increased USD 0.3 billion month-on-month to USD 51.9 billion. Tourism revenues, which have been strong throughout the year, continue to contribute positively to the current account balance. Travel revenues increased USD 5.6 billion in the first nine months of the year compared to the same period of the previous year, and reached USD 36.8 billion. Similarly, the number of foreign visitors increased 13.6% year-on-year to 38.6 million in the first nine months of the year.
Cost Conditions
21.    The upward trend in energy commodity prices that started in July, which prior to it had been declining since the second half of 2022, ended in October and prices fell again. Non-energy commodity prices, which remained almost flat in recent months, also decreased in October. In the first three weeks of November, the decline in prices in the energy group continued, while non-energy commodity prices remained flat.
22.    In October, domestic producer prices rose 1.94%, while annual inflation went down by 8.05 percentage points to 39.4%. According to main industrial groupings, prices in the energy group decreased while price increases in other groups, particularly in the non-durable consumer group, continued. Annual inflation decreased significantly in the energy group helped by the base effect, while displayed a more limited decrease in other main groups. 
23.    The Global Supply Chain Pressure Index decreased and remained positive in October. As was the case in October, exchange rates moderately increased in November. 
24.    The adjustment in the minimum wage in July 2023, accompanied by wage adjustments for civil servants and public sector workers, and wage hikes becoming broad-based had important impacts on inflation in the third quarter of the year, particularly through the cost channel. It is evaluated that wage-driven effects are waning in the final quarter of the year. 
25.    Fuel prices can have a significant impact on consumer prices, particularly on transport services, through both production inputs and transportation costs. In fact, the significant increase in fuel prices in the third quarter driven by exchange rates, crude oil prices and tax arrangements have rapidly passed through to transport services prices within the same quarter. In the following period, in tandem with the decline in fuel prices, the rate of increase in transport services prices decreased to 1.37%.
26.    Therefore, it is evaluated that the intense cost-push pressures in the third quarter have been largely reflected on prices.
Stickiness of Services Inflation
27.    The services sector has posted strong price increases since July. Monthly price increases in the services sector, which displays significant inertia, are higher compared to 2022. Annual inflation in the C index, which includes the core goods and services groups, is around 70%, while annual inflation in the services sector is around 89%. Additionally, the diffusion index for the services sector is hovering approximately 33% above its historical average, indicating that the increases continue to spread across the sector.
28.    Rising house prices, backward-indexation behavior, and imbalances between supply and demand in the real estate market are pushing rent increases upwards and adversely affecting consumer inflation. On the other hand, the data monitored through online platforms indicate that rents in big cities continue to slow down in the recent period.
29.    In the restaurants and hotels subgroup that is significantly affected by food, wage and tourism developments, monthly price increases display a persistent outlook. While the weakening in lagged effects of the minimum wage remains in place, the relative importance of food prices in the outlook for restaurant and hotel prices is increasing. In October, the upward trend in catering services prices continued, while prices in accommodation services decreased.
30.    Certain services items, particularly rents, education, health, recreation and culture exhibit pricing behavior indexed to past consumer inflation, prompting inflationary effects to spread over a long period of time. Communication services, which are subject to price rigidities arising from contracts, have a similar effect, and price increases in this subgroup strengthened. Based on the recent realizations consumer inflation, there is a risk that inflation will remain high in certain services items for an extended period.
Inflation Expectations
31.    The Committee assesses that inflation expectations and pricing behavior started to show signs of improvement. The consumer inflation diffusion index, one of the indicators followed in order to monitor developments in price setting behavior, continued to decline in October as the share of items with decreasing prices rose. The durable goods sector, which is expected to be affected more rapidly by financial conditions, stands out in this respect. While price increases, particularly in automobiles, slowed down, discounts were also observed in certain products.
32.    Inflation expectations decreased in November. According to the November results of the Survey of Market Participants, the current year-end inflation expectation decreased 0.78 percentage points from 68.0% to 67.2%, the 12-month-ahead inflation expectation decreased 1.34 percentage points from 45.2% to 43.9%, the 24-month-ahead inflation expectation decreased 0.73 percentage points from 25.8% to 25.1%. Meanwhile, the five-year-ahead inflation expectation was revised upwards 0.49 percentage points from 11.8% to 12.2%.
Monetary and Financial Conditions
33.    The initial impact of monetary tightening on financial indicators has become more salient, and continues to support both credit and deposit developments.
34.    With the effect of monetary and quantitative tightening and simplification decisions, lending rates are assessed to be in line with the targeted level of financial tightness. Average personal loan rates (excluding overdraft accounts), which have remained flat since the previous MPC meeting period, became 59.5% as of 17 November 2023. Vehicle and housing loan rates materialized at 43.8% and 42.4%, respectively, as of 17 November 2023. Meanwhile, Turkish lira commercial loan rates increased 215 basis points to 50.3%.
35.    The normalization in loan growth and composition continued. As of 17 November 2023, the retail loan balance increased 126.5% in credit cards, 79.9% in vehicle loans, 37.4% in general-purpose loans, and 22.4% in housing loans compared to end-2022, amounting to an increase of 61.2% in total. The average 4-week growth rate of retail loans since the previous MPC meeting period, which continued to lose momentum due to monetary tightening and other steps taken, stood at 2.05%. In the same period, average 4-week growth rates of vehicle and general-purpose loans materialized at 1.39% and 1.33%, respectively. Although personal credit cards maintained their strong trend with an average 4-week growth rate of 4.00%, its growth rate continued to slow down. On the other hand, Turkish lira-denominated commercial loans experienced an average 4-week growth rate of 2.15% in the same period.
36.    To maintain long-term price stability, technological transformation that will improve the current account balance, strategic investments that will contribute to the continuity of supply, and exports continue to be supported. Programs undertaken for this purpose are enhanced to include financing costs as well as access to credit, while overseeing the macro-financial balance. The Advance Loans Against Investment Commitment (ALAIC) program, which intends to utilize long-term resources with favorable financing costs in areas that will support macro-financial stability, has been restructured in a framework that highlights the contribution to price stability, technological value and the strategic nature of investments. Moreover, while overall credit growth has normalized, daily limits on rediscount credits for export and FX-earning services have been increased tenfold in total to TRY 3 billion. Arrangements have also been made to ease access to credit, and a cap on discount rates applied to these credits.
37.    As of June, the measures taken to ensure the sound functioning of the banking system within the scope of the simplification process have primarily restored the flow of Turkish lira commercial loans. Turkish lira commercial loans, which increased 0.34% across the sector in June, grew 2.38% in July, 2.26% in August, 2.52 % in September, and 2.39% in October. Meanwhile, Turkish lira deposit rates stood at 24.9% in the week ending 18 August, at 33.5% in the week ending 15 September, at 37.9% in the week ending 13 October, and at 40.8% in the week ending 17 November. In parallel, Turkish lira deposits have started increasing while FX-protected and FX-denominated deposits have both declined. Owing to the policy rate hike and the recent steps taken as part of the simplification of the macroprudential framework, it is evaluated that there was a growth in the demand for Turkish lira denominated assets. Simultaneously, loan and deposit rates also rose in tandem, resulting in the strengthening of the monetary transmission mechanism. 
38.    Due also to the policy rate decision taken in November, the Committee evaluates that the regulations to increase the share of Turkish lira deposits and monetary tightening will continue to strengthen the transmission mechanism and to improve the funding composition of the banking system.
39.    The improvement in external financing conditions, continued increase in foreign exchange reserves, positive impact of demand rebalancing on current account balance, and the increase in domestic and foreign demand for Turkish lira denominated assets contribute significantly to exchange rate stability and the effectiveness of monetary policy.
40.    With the recently-signed agreements, foreign direct investments that will focus on improving technology investments and production capacity will support external financing in the upcoming period.
41.    Türkiye's five-year CDS premium, which peaked this year with 703 basis points on 22 May 2023 amid domestic uncertainties, decreased further to 340 basis points as of 22 November 2023, down from 417 basis points in the previous MPC meeting period. 1-month and 12-month exchange rate volatilities of the Turkish lira declined 2.9 and 5.0 percentage points, respectively, in this MPC meeting period to 8.0% and 22.8% as of 22 November 2023. Falling figures in the risk premium and exchange rate volatilities were accompanied by net portfolio inflows totaling USD 1.89 billion since June, USD 0.66 billion of which went to the government domestic debt securities (GDDS) market and USD 1.23 billion to the equity market.
42.    International reserves of the Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye (CBRT) maintain the strong upward trend they assumed in June. Having declined from USD 128.8 billion at the end of 2022 to USD 98.5 billion at the end of May, gross international reserves of the CBRT rose to USD 134.5 billion as of 17 November 2023. The upward trend in reserves has gained momentum recently and a significant increase of USD 8.3 billion has been recorded since the previous MPC meeting.
Monetary Policy
43.    The Committee has decided to raise the policy rate (the one-week repo auction rate) from 35% to 40%. Given the inflation outlook and the upside risks, the Committee evaluated strengthening the monetary policy framework in line with the price stability objective. The Committee drew attention to the risks that high inflation may pose to macroeconomic stability and especially financial stability. Taking into account the cumulative and lagged effects of monetary tightening, the Committee will continue to determine the policy decisions in a way that will create monetary and financial conditions necessary to ensure a decline in the underlying trend of inflation and to reach the 5% inflation target in the medium term.
44.    The Committee assessed that the current level of monetary tightness is significantly close to the level required to establish the disinflation course. Accordingly, the pace of monetary tightening will slow down and the tightening cycle will be completed in a short period of time. The monetary tightness will be maintained as long as needed to ensure sustained price stability.
45.    To increase the functionality of market mechanisms and strengthen macro financial stability, the Committee continues to simplify and improve the existing micro- and macroprudential framework. Impact analyses of the CBRT's regulations are conducted for all components of the framework by assessing their impact on inflation, interest rates, exchange rates, reserves, expectations, securities, and financial stability with a holistic approach. With the decisions taken accordingly, it is assessed that significant progress has been made in the simplification process.
46.    In addition to policy rate decisions, the Committee will continue to make quantitative tightening decisions to support the monetary policy stance. While the policy rate, the main policy instrument, affect monetary and financial conditions and expectations, these decisions aim to stabilize excess Turkish lira liquidity and increase the effectiveness of monetary policy.
47.    The Turkish lira liquidity inflows to the financial system stemming from the foreign exchange difference payments of FX-protected deposit accounts due to the exchange rate developments are closely monitored. Due actions will be taken based on the impact analyses in view of the current market conditions and liquidity projections for the upcoming period.
48.    Indicators of inflation and underlying trend of inflation will be closely monitored, and the Committee will continue to decisively use all the tools at its disposal in line with its main objective of price stability.
49.    The Committee will continue to make its decisions in a predictable, data-driven, and transparent framework.

Press Release on Interest Rates
Participating Committee Members
Hafize Gaye Erkan (Governor), Osman Cevdet Akçay, Elif Haykır Hobikoğlu, Yaşar Fatih Karahan, Hatice Karahan.
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to raise the policy rate (the one-week repo auction rate) from 40 percent to 42.5 percent.
Headline inflation edged up in November and remains in line with the outlook presented in the most recent Inflation Report. The existing level of domestic demand, stickiness in services inflation, and geopolitical risks keep inflation pressures alive. On the other hand, recent indicators suggest that domestic demand continues to moderate as monetary tightening is reflected in financial conditions. The Committee also assesses that inflation expectations and pricing behavior started to show signs of improvement. The notable improvement in external financing conditions, continued increase in foreign exchange reserves, positive impact of demand rebalancing on current account balance, and the accelerated increase in domestic and foreign demand for Turkish lira denominated assets contribute significantly to exchange rate stability and the effectiveness of monetary policy. In light of these developments, the decline in the underlying trend of monthly inflation continues.
Assessing that monetary tightness is significantly close to the level required to establish the disinflation course, the Committee reduced the pace of monetary tightening. The Committee anticipates to complete the tightening cycle as soon as possible. The monetary tightness will be maintained as long as needed to ensure sustained price stability.
To increase the functionality of market mechanism and strengthen macro financial stability, the Committee continues to simplify and improve the existing micro- and macroprudential framework. While lending rates are assessed to be in line with the targeted level of financial tightness, the Committee evaluates that along with monetary tightening, the regulations to increase the share of Turkish lira deposits will continue to strengthen the transmission mechanism and to improve the funding composition of the banking system. In addition to policy rate decisions, the Committee will continue to implement quantitative tightening by extending the sterilization tools at its disposal in order to support the monetary tightening process.
Taking into account the cumulative and lagged effects of monetary tightening, the Committee will continue to determine its policy decisions in a way that will create monetary and financial conditions necessary to ensure a decline in the underlying trend of inflation and to reach the 5 percent inflation target in the medium term.
Indicators of inflation and underlying trend of inflation will be closely monitored and the Committee will continue to decisively use all the tools at its disposal in line with its main objective of price stability.
The Committee will continue to make its decisions in a predictable, data-driven and transparent framework.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

2023,21 December 2023,Press Release on Maximum Interest Rates for Credit Cards (2023-53),"No: 2023-53
21 December 2023
Press Release on Maximum Interest Rates for Credit Cards (2023-53)




Maximum interest rates for credit cards and maximum commission rates for merchants will remain unchanged.




To prevent maximum interest rates for credit cards and maximum commission rates for merchants from exceeding their current levels, an upper limit is introduced for the reference rate.
The upper limit has been determined as 3.11 percent, which is the current level of the reference rate, and the current calculation method has been kept unchanged for rates below this level.  
Accordingly, there will be no increase in the most recently announced rates for maximum interest rates for credit cards and maximum commission rates for merchants.
The reference rate used in the calculation of maximum interest rates for credit card transactions and maximum commission rates for merchants is calculated pursuant to the method specified in the Communiqué on Procedures and Principles regarding the Fees that Banks can Charge Their Commercial Clients (No: 2020/4), and announced accordingly.
The reference rate is calculated based on the lower of the weighted average flow interest rate that banks apply to Turkish lira deposits with a maturity of 32-45 days, and the policy rate plus ten percent.

2023,28 December 2023,Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting,"No: 2023-55
28 December 2023
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 21 December 2023
Global Economy
1.    Global inflation has been decreasing recently, but it remains above the long-term averages and central bank targets. Compared to the previous Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting period, consumer inflation decreased from 3.36% to 2.67% in advanced economies, while it increased from 6.08% to 6.16% in emerging economies due to the rise in Russia (1). Accordingly, inflation continues to hover above the average target rate of 2% in advanced economies and 3.5% in emerging economies. Average annual inflation expectations for the last quarter of 2023 for advanced and emerging economies are 3.2% and 6.4%, respectively. On the other hand, compared to the previous MPC meeting period, core inflation declined from 3.97% to 3.76% in advanced economies and from 6.50% to 6.48% in emerging economies. Average annual inflation expectations for the last quarter of 2023 are 3.2% in the USA and 2.9% in the euro area, while core inflation expectations are 3.5% and 3.9%, respectively.
2.    Despite widespread decline in commodity prices recently, geopolitical risks, financial conditions and supply-side factors cause oil prices to remain volatile. Brent crude oil prices per barrel have fluctuated in the USD 73-83 range since the previous MPC meeting while the Title Transfer Facility (TTF) price, which serves as a benchmark for European natural gas prices, has decreased. The current level of the Commodity Price Index is 25.6% above the average of the previous ten years. The index fell 29.0% from its peak level last year. Similarly, the Agricultural Commodity Price Index, which has declined 15.9% from its peak level last year, is 10.1% above the average of the previous ten years. Its level continues to have an impact on inflation due to the high share of food items in consumer basket.
3.    High levels of core inflation and inflation expectations imply that global inflation will continue to remain above the targets of central banks for some time. Nevertheless, in their communications, central banks of advanced economies, particularly the Federal Reserve (Fed), highlighted the decline in core inflation and lowered their medium-term inflation forecasts. As a result, expectations that rate cuts may start earlier in 2024 have strengthened, while projections for the likely course of policy rates have been revised downwards. The central banks of 12 advanced countries held a total of 172 meetings in the last 22 months, and policy rates were increased in 107 of these meetings (2). During the same period, 15 emerging countries' central banks held a total of 254 meetings, and policy rates were increased in 107 of these meetings. As a result of the monetary policies implemented, global financial conditions have become significantly tighter, the frequency of policy rate decisions has decreased and central banks of many advanced and emerging economies have reached the end of monetary tightening process. The Bank of Russia continued to increase policy rates as the uptrend in inflation continued.  Meanwhile, central banks of Brazil, Peru, Chile and Hungary continued with policy rate cuts on the back of the decline in consumer inflation, while the Central Bank of Colombia cut its policy rate for the first time in a long time. Given the levels of inflation and the central banks’ policy communications, it is expected that policy rates in these economies will continue to be adjusted in line with decreasing inflation, however, the tightness of monetary policy is expected to maintained so as to ensure the disinflationary trend. 
4.    Despite the flat global growth outlook, labor markets continue to be tight. The global growth index, which is weighted with the export shares of Türkiye’s foreign trade partners, declined slightly compared to the previous MPC meeting. The index projects a growth level of 1.6% in 2023, which is approximately 0.3 percentage points higher than its lowest level in January. However, considering the 3.5% growth of the index in 2022, a notable slowdown in the global growth outlook, which affects Türkiye’s foreign demand, is observed on an annual basis. On the other hand, the Global Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data posted a limited rise in November. In November, the global manufacturing industry PMI increased 0.5 points month-on-month to 49.3, while the global services PMI increased 0.2 points to 50.6. Thus, in November, the global composite PMI index increased 0.4 points over the previous month and reached 50.4. The rise in the global PMI data was driven by both advanced and emerging economies. Nevertheless, a comparison between the average values of global PMI data for the October-November period and averages of previous quarters reveals that PMI indices have declined compared to the first half of the year. The PMI data for the services sector, which was the major driving force of global economic activity particularly in the first half of the year, significantly declined in the October-November period both in the advanced economies group and the emerging economies group. The composite PMI indicator for the Euoro Area, one of the Türkiye’s major trading partner, decreased 0.6 points month-on-month to 47 in December and continued to hover below the threshold value. In the Euro Area, compared to the previous month, the manufacturing PMI remained unchanged in December, while services PMI decreased 0.7 points and these indicators were recorded at 44.2 and 48.1, respectively. On a quarterly basis, the Euro Area composite PMI declined 0.5 points quarter-on-quarter to 47 in the final quarter of the year. This indicates that the slowdown in economic activity in the Euro Area in the third quarter continues in the last quarter of the year. In China, the composite PMI rose 1.6 points to 51.6 in November, driven by both manufacturing and services sectors. Meanwhile, the October-November average of the Chinese composite PMI declined 0.7 points quarter-on-quarter to 50.8. Against this background, the slowdown in global economic activity in the third quarter is expected to continue in the last quarter and the global economy is projected to display a growth outlook similar to the third quarter.
5.    In the August-October period (31 July-3 November 2023), due to the expectation that central banks of advanced economies will maintain their tight monetary policy stance for a longer period, the fluctuations in the global risk appetite, and the uncertainty regarding the Chinese economy, there was a total outflow of USD 54.6 billion from equity markets and USD 5.4 billion from bond markets of emerging economies. In the following period, the US inflation decreased in two consecutive months in October and November to 3.1%, and the Fed’s communication at its December meeting led to a significant recovery in the global risk appetite. As a result, in the five weeks between the 6th of November and the 8th of December, USD 15.9 billion flowed into equity markets and USD 3.6 billion into bond markets.  
6.    The recent stabilization of the decline in the core inflation trend in advanced economies and the ongoing easing of supply-side factors, combined with the weak course of commodity prices, have led to an improvement in the global inflation outlook. Geopolitical risks, the level of monetary tightness and the timing of interest rate cuts by central banks of advanced economies will determine the course of the global economy in the upcoming period.
Inflation Developments
7.    Consumer prices rose 3.28% in November, and annual inflation increased 0.62 percentage points to 62.0%. Headline inflation edged up in November and remains in line with the outlook presented in the most recent Inflation Report. As the limit for the free use of natural gas was exceeded (first 25 cubic metres), the impact of the natural gas item on the monthly consumer inflation rose to 1.01 percentage points, which is consistent with projections. When the effect of natural gas is excluded, the rate of increase in consumer prices declined further. While exchange rates follow a steady course, global energy prices continue to recede from the readings at the end of September. However, the existing level of domestic demand, stickiness in services inflation, and geopolitical risks keep inflation pressures alive. 
8.    Contributions of subgroups to annual inflation rose from 1.74 percentage points to 3.13 percentage points in the energy group (up by 1.39 percentage points); from 2.59 percentage points to 2.90 percentage points in the total of alcohol, tobacco and gold groups (up by 0.31 percentage points); from 23.4 percentage points to 23.5 percentage points in the services group (up by 0.16 percentage points); but decreased from 17.8 percentage points to 17.0 percentage points in the food and non-alcoholic beverages group (down by 0.84 percentage points) and from 15.8 percentage points to 15.4 percentage points in the core goods group (down by 0.40 percentage points).
9.    Prices of the food and non-alcoholic beverages group rose 2.78% in November, while annual inflation declined 4.83 percentage points to 67.2% in this group. Seasonally adjusted data show that prices increased mildly in fruits and a decline in vegetables. Price increases remained strong in the food group excluding fresh fruits and vegetables. In November, price hikes were noteworthy in pulses, rice and white meat within the other unprocessed food group. In this period, monthly price increases grew larger in the processed food group, with prices of milk and dairy products, processed meat products, fats and oils and canned vegetables coming to the fore.
10.    Energy prices increased 9.98% in November, and annual energy inflation increased 9.58 percentage points to 21.2%. In line with the higher consumption of natural gas, 25 cubic meters of which is offered free of charge, prices included in the basket rose further, raising energy prices. Accordingly, the natural gas item pushed monthly headline inflation up 1.01 percentage points in November. The contribution of natural gas to monthly inflation is projected to weaken in December. Following the developments in crude oil prices, fuel prices fell 1.06%. In tandem with global energy prices, the increase in solid fuel prices lost pace and stood at 1.95%, while bottled gas prices remained almost unchanged. In November, the rise in municipal water prices was 2.90%, significantly down from the previous month.
11.    Prices in the services group were up 2.76% in November, and the group’s annual inflation increased 1.06 percentage points to 89.7%. Annual inflation declined in the restaurants-hotels subgroup, but increased in others, with rents in the lead. When the rent subgroup is excluded, annual inflation proves almost unchanged. In the rents subgroup, the monthly increase decelerated compared to October with 5.97%, while the subgroup’s annual inflation went up 5.14 percentage points to 105.8%. Fuelled by ongoing increases in mobile phone call as well as internet fees, communication services posted a monthly price increase of 5.20%, bringing annual inflation to 60.6%. In the restaurants-hotels subgroup, the monthly price increase in catering services lost momentum, while the decline in accommodation prices continued. In the other services subgroup, prices rose moderately by 1.73%, indicating an ongoing slowdown in this group. Parallel to the fall in fuel prices, prices in transport services were relatively stable. 
12.    Annual core goods inflation dropped 0.81 percentage points to 52.2%. Across subgroups, price increases remained limited as they did in October, while they decelerated in clothing and footwear contrary to seasonal trends. Annual inflation receded in durable goods, but increased in other subgroups. Prices in durable goods (excluding gold) edged up by 0.66%. Electrical and non-electrical home appliances saw falling prices, while automobiles and furniture recorded mild price increases. In the clothing and footwear group, prices dropped 0.38%, while annual inflation went up 1.62 percentage points to 39.7%. Prices in other core goods rose 2.66% in line with the last two months, and annual inflation crept up by 0.72 percentage points to 50.1%.
13.    The decline in the underlying trend of monthly inflation continues (3). Seasonally adjusted monthly increases slowed in November in the B, and, more notably, in the C index. This outlook is also confirmed by the declining figures in the diffusion index, Median and SATRIM indicators. The three-month average increases in the seasonally adjusted B and C indices, which peaked at 8.79% and 8.65% respectively in February 2022, stood at 3.49% and 3.61% in November 2023. In November, the seasonally adjusted rates of increase in the B and C indices were measured at 2.56% and 2.57%, respectively. The consumer inflation diffusion index declined further in November, and its upward standard deviation from the historical average fell from 1.4 in October to 0.5. 
14.    Leading indicators suggest that the underlying trend of inflation has maintained the November levels. According to preliminary data, price increases are strong in the energy group, despite some month-on-month deceleration, which is driven by the natural gas item. It is predicted that due to seasonal increase in consumption, the effect of the natural gas use above the freely-provided 25 cubic meters on measured prices pushed November inflation up by 1.01 percentage points, while it is estimated to decline to around 0.33 percentage points in December. Price increases recorded a month-on-month slowdown in the processed food subgroup, while unprocessed food price increases strengthened due to developments in vegetables and red meat. Monthly services inflation is likely to remain stickier as anticipated, while the core goods subgroup is projected to register some increase due to durable goods.
15.    Monthly inflation will rise in January due to wage adjustments, particularly the minimum wage, and items with a high tendency for time-dependent price setting. This rise in monthly inflation, which is also reflected in the Inflation Report forecasts, is expected to slow down in February and beyond, and hover close to the decline in the underlying trend of inflation in the first half of the year.
Demand and Production
16.    Recent indicators suggest that domestic demand continues to moderate as monetary tightening is reflected in financial conditions. Accordingly, while the trend of imports weakens, the foreign trade balance displays a relatively favorable outlook. On the other hand, discounts and campaigns, in particular, have been the factors curbing the decline in demand. 
17.    In October, adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects, the retail sales volume index increased by 2% on a monthly basis. The annual growth of the retail sales volume index fell 0.5 percentage points to 13.7%, while in quarterly terms, retail sales remained flat following the 0.6% rise in the third quarter. In November, when campaigns intensified, the upward trend in card expenditures continued. Seasonally adjusted leading indicators, on the other hand, hint at a new deceleration in the rate of increase of card expenditures in December. In seasonally adjusted terms, manufacturing firms’ registered orders from the domestic market decreased in the fourth quarter. An analysis of the broad economic categories reveals that the decline was more pronounced in the durable goods group. Interviews with firms also imply that discount campaigns and the demand response in the said period curbed the loss of momentum in domestic sales. Although the rebalancing that started with the monetary tightening process continues, it is evaluated that demand conditions may not weaken due to wage hikes in January. Accordingly, the current level of demand continues to be considered as a risk factor on inflation.
18.    In October, the seasonally and calendar adjusted industrial production index decreased 0.4% month-on-month, while, adjusted for calendar effects, it increased 1.1% on an annual basis. On a quarterly basis, industrial production fell 0.7% as of October compared to the third quarter. Excluding the sectors with high monthly volatility, industrial production posted a quarterly decrease of 0.2%. In November, the seasonally adjusted capacity utilization rate increased 0.7 percentage points month-on-month to 77.5%.
19.    As of October, seasonally adjusted employment stood at 31.8 million. In this period, seasonally adjusted employment increased 0.6% quarter-on-quarter, while the labor force participation rate decreased 0.1 percentage points. In October, unemployment rate decreased 0.5 percentage points to 8.5% from 9.0% in September. High-frequency data indicate that demand remains robust in the labor market.
20.    In October, in line with the ongoing downward trend in the foreign trade deficit, the annualized current account deficit fell USD 1 billion from the previous month’s level to USD 50.7 billion. This fall was driven by the rise in exports, decline in the gold trade deficit, and the improvement in the energy balance due to the ongoing annual decline in energy prices, whereas foreign trade deficit excluding gold and energy recorded an increase. Provisional foreign trade data for November indicate that seasonally adjusted exports and imports posted a monthly decrease, with imports registering a more pronounced decline originating from goods groups other than investment goods. The three-month average trend, considered along with the high frequency data for December, implies a rise in exports and a flat course in imports as well as an annual decline. Although imports of durable consumption goods have been stimulated by campaigns, their seasonally adjusted growth is estimated to have continued to slow down in the last quarter of the year. Preliminary data for the last quarter point to an increase in gold exports and a continued course of gold imports above historical averages, while the improvement in gold balance continues in annualized terms.
21.    As of October, the annual services balance surplus decreased USD 0.3 billion month-on-month to USD 51.7 billion. On the other hand, tourism revenues, which have been strong throughout the year, continue to contribute positively to the current account balance. Travel revenues increased by USD 5.8 billion in the first ten months of the year compared to the same period of the previous year, and reached USD 42.2 billion. Similarly, the number of foreign visitors increased 12.6% year-on-year to 44.1 million in the first ten months of the year.
Cost Conditions
22.    The upward trend in energy commodity prices that started in July, prior to which had been declining since the second half of 2022, ended in October and prices started to fall again in the following period. Non-energy commodity prices, which remained almost flat in recent months, also decreased in October before returning to their relatively flat course in November. In the first three weeks of December, the decline in prices in the energy group continued, while non-energy commodity prices also registered some decrease.
23.    In November, domestic producer prices rose 2.81%, while annual inflation increased 2.86 percentage points to 42.3%. As cumulative cost increases were transmitted, industrial electricity and natural gas tariffs as well as electricity producers’ natural gas tariffs were raised by 20% in early October, the impact of which was observed on the electricity, gas, steam, and air conditioning supply group in November. Thus, according to main industrial groupings, the most significant increase was observed in the energy group. In this period, annual inflation realized as -5.9 in energy group remaining in the negative territory, while it remained relatively flat course at high rates in other main groups.
24.    The Global Supply Chain Pressure Index converged to its historical trend in November, while international transportation costs remained low in this period. Global commodity prices continued to decline in November. Exchange rates have maintained their recent mild course. 
25.    Fuel prices can have a significant impact on consumer prices, particularly on transport services, through both production inputs and transportation costs. In fact, the significant increase in fuel prices in the third quarter driven by exchange rates, crude oil prices and tax arrangements have rapidly passed through to transport services prices within the same quarter. In tandem with the decline in fuel prices that started in October, transport services prices remained flat in November. On the back of the ongoing fall in fuel prices, leading indicators suggest that the favorable course of transport services prices will continue in December. However, the volatility in oil prices triggered by geopolitical developments remains as a potential risk factor for inflation.
26.    Against this background, it is evaluated that the intense cost-push pressures in the third quarter have been broadly passed through to prices.
Stickiness of Services Inflation
27.    The services sector has posted strong price increases since July. Monthly price increases in the services sector, which displays significant inertia, are higher compared to 2022. Annual inflation in the C index, which includes the core goods and services groups, is around 70%, while annual inflation in the services sector is around 90%. Additionally, the diffusion index for the services sector is hovering approximately 45% above its historical average, indicating that the increases continue to spread across the sector.
28.    Rising house prices, backward-indexation behavior, and imbalances between supply and demand in the real estate market are pushing rent increases upwards and adversely affecting consumer inflation. On the other hand, while the rise in house prices is losing pace, rents monitored through micro data from the Retail Payment System (RPS) as well as the data for big cities monitored through online platforms indicate that the rate of increase in rents has slowed down in the recent period. In fact, consistent with this overall picture, the price increase in rents subgroup has registered a slowdown in November.
29.    In the restaurants and hotels subgroup that is significantly affected by food, wage and tourism developments, monthly price increases display a persistent outlook. In the recent period, catering services prices continue to be the main driver of the restaurants and hotels subgroup through food prices. While the monthly price increase in catering services in the restaurants-hotels subgroup lost momentum in November, the fall in accommodation prices continued. Thus, the subgroup’s inflation displayed a milder outlook compared to the previous month.
30.    Certain services items, particularly rents, education, health, recreation and culture, exhibit pricing behavior indexed to past consumer inflation, prompting inflationary effects to persist over a long period of time. Communication services, which are subject to price rigidities arising from contracts, have a similar effect, and price increases in this subgroup remain strong. Based on the recent realizations of consumer inflation, there is a risk that inflation will remain high in certain services items for an extended period.
Inflation Expectations
31.    The Committee assesses that inflation expectations and pricing behavior started to show signs of improvement. The consumer inflation diffusion index, one of the indicators followed in order to monitor developments in pricing behavior, continued to decline in November as the share of items with decreasing prices rose. In the durable goods group, whose inflation can rapidly slow in periods of weakened effects of shocks, the diffusion index receded to its historical average.
32.    The fall in inflation expectations continues. According to the December results of the Survey of Market Participants, the current year-end inflation expectation decreased 1.84 percentage points from 67.2% to 65.4%, the 12-month-ahead inflation expectation decreased 2.71 percentage points from 43.9% to 41.2%, the 24-month-ahead inflation expectation decreased 0.27 percentage points from 25.1% to 24.8%. Meanwhile, the five-year-ahead inflation expectation was revised upwards 0.34 percentage points from 12.3% to 12.6%. In addition to the level of inflation expectations, their distribution has also registered a partial improvement. The distribution of 12-month-ahead inflation expectations points to a growing consensus around the central tendency compared to the previous month.
Monetary and Financial Conditions
33.    With the effect of monetary and quantitative tightening and simplification decisions, the current lending rates are assessed to be in line with the targeted level of financial tightness. In the period between the previous MPC meeting when the policy rate was raised 5 percentage points and the latest MPC meeting, commercial and consumer loan rates displayed a flat outlook with a change of 0.2 and 0.92 percentage points, respectively. During the same period, deposit rates increased by an average of 4.04 points across all maturities and by 6.1 points for up to 3-month deposits strengthening monetary transmission.
34.    Housing loan rates, which have remained flat since the previous MPC meeting period, stood at 42%. Vehicle loan rates dropped by 750 basis points to 32.8% driven by the end-of-year sales campaigns, whereas general purpose loan rates (excluding overdraft accounts) mildly increased to 61.7% as of 15 December 2023. On the other hand, Turkish lira commercial loan rates remained stable at 51.8%.
35.    The normalization in loan growth and composition continued. As of 15 December 2023, the retail loan balance increased 141.7% in credit cards, 85.0% in vehicle loans, 41.1% in general-purpose loans, and 21.8% in housing loans compared to end-2022, amounting to an increase of 67.4% in total. The average 4-week growth rate of retail loans, which continued to lose momentum due to monetary tightening and other steps taken, stood at 3.33%, with a slight increase since the previous MPC meeting period due to end-of-year spending. The average 4-week growth rates of vehicle and general-purpose loans materialized at 2.29% and 2.10%, respectively. Personal credit cards recorded a higher rate of 6.26%. On the other hand, Turkish lira-denominated commercial loans and FX commercial loans adjusted for exchange rates recorded an average 4-week growth rate of 2.18% and 0.02%, respectively, in the same period. 
36.    To maintain long-term price stability, technological transformation that will improve the current account balance, strategic investments that will contribute to the continuity of supply, and exports continue to be supported. Programs undertaken for this purpose have been enhanced to include financing costs as well as access to credit, while overseeing the macro-financial stability. The Advance Loans Against Investment Commitment (ALAIC) program, which intends to utilize long-term resources with favorable financing costs in areas that will support macro-financial stability, is implemented in a framework that highlights the contribution to price stability, technological value, and the strategic nature of investments. Moreover, while overall credit growth has normalized, the commercial loan composition is expected to be shaped in a way that will contribute to the current account balance on the back of the regulatory changes in rediscount credits for export and FX-earning services.
37.    As of June, the measures taken to ensure the sound functioning of the banking system within the scope of the simplification process have primarily restored the flow of Turkish lira commercial loans. Turkish lira commercial loans, which increased 0.34% across the sector in June, grew 2.38% in July, 2.26% in August, 2.52 % in September, 2.39% in October, and 2.20% in November. Meanwhile, Turkish lira deposit rates stood at 24.9% in the week ending 18 August, at 33.5% in the week ending 15 September, at 37.9% in the week ending 13 October, at 40.8% in the week ending 17 November, and at 45.8% in the week ending 15 December. In parallel, Turkish lira deposits have started increasing while FX-protected deposits have declined. Owing to the policy rate hike and the recent steps taken as part of the simplification of the macroprudential framework, it is evaluated that there was a growth in the demand for Turkish lira denominated assets. Simultaneously, loan and deposit rates also rose in tandem, resulting in the strengthening of the monetary transmission mechanism. 
38.    Due also to the policy rate decision taken in December, the Committee evaluates that along with monetary tightening, the regulations to increase the share of Turkish lira deposits will continue to strengthen the transmission mechanism and to improve the funding composition of the banking system. 
39.    The notable improvement in external financing conditions, continued increase in foreign exchange reserves, positive impact of demand rebalancing on current account balance, and the accelerated increase in domestic and foreign demand for Turkish lira denominated assets contribute significantly to exchange rate stability and the effectiveness of monetary policy.
40.    With the recently-signed agreements, foreign direct investments that will focus on improving technology investments and production capacity will support external financing in the upcoming period.
41.    Türkiye's five-year CDS premium, which peaked this year with 703 basis points on 22 May 2023 amid domestic uncertainties, decreased further to 284 basis points as of 20 December 2023, down from 340 basis points in the previous MPC meeting period. While the 1-month forward exchange rate volatility of the Turkish lira decreased by 0.1 point in the current MPC period, the 12-month forward exchange rate volatility increased by 1 point and reached 7.8 percent and 23.8 percent, respectively, as of December 20, 2023. Falling figures in the risk premium and exchange rate volatilities were accompanied by net portfolio inflows totaling USD 4.8 billion since June, USD 2 billion of which went to the government domestic debt securities (GDDS) market and USD 2.8 billion to the equity market.
42.    International reserves of the Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye (CBRT) maintain the strong upward trend they assumed in June. Having declined from USD 128.8 billion at the end of 2022 to USD 98.5 billion at the end of May, gross international reserves of the CBRT rose to USD 142.5 billion as of 15 December 2023. The upward trend in reserves has gained momentum recently and a significant increase of USD 8.1 billion has been recorded since the previous MPC meeting.
Monetary Policy
43.    The Committee has decided to raise the policy rate (the one-week repo auction rate) from 40% to 42.5. Taking into account the cumulative and lagged effects of monetary tightening, the Committee will continue to determine its policy decisions in a way that will create monetary and financial conditions necessary to ensure a decline in the underlying trend of inflation and to reach the 5% inflation target in the medium term.
44.    Assessing that monetary tightness is significantly close to the level required to establish the disinflation course, the Committee reduced the pace of monetary tightening. The Committee anticipates to complete the tightening cycle as soon as possible. The monetary tightness will be maintained as long as needed to ensure sustained price stability.
45.    To increase the functionality of market mechanism and strengthen macro financial stability, the Committee continues to simplify and improve the existing micro- and macroprudential framework. Impact analyses of the CBRT's regulations are conducted for all components of the framework by assessing their impact on inflation, interest rates, exchange rates, reserves, expectations, securities, and financial stability with a holistic approach. With the decisions taken accordingly, it is assessed that significant progress has been made in the simplification process.
46.    Recently, there has been excess liquidity in the market driven by the components affecting liquidity, particularly the ongoing increase in international reserves. In addition to policy rate decisions, the Committee will continue to implement quantitative tightening by extending the sterilization tools at its disposal in order to support the monetary tightening process. While the policy rate, the main policy instrument, affect monetary and financial conditions and expectations, these decisions aim to stabilize excess Turkish lira liquidity and increase the effectiveness of monetary policy.
47.    Indicators of inflation and underlying trend of inflation will be closely monitored, and the Committee will continue to decisively use all the tools at its disposal in line with its main objective of price stability.
48.    The Committee will continue to make its decisions in a predictable, data-driven, and transparent framework.
(1) Advanced Economies: The USA, Czechia, Denmark, the Euro Area, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Japan, Canada, Norway.
Emerging Economies: Brazil, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Africa, India, Colombia, Hungary, Mexico, Peru, Poland, Romania, Russia, Chile, Thailand, Türkiye.
(2) Australia and New Zealand, which are not included in the inflation country set as their data are at quarterly frequency, are included in the policy rate analysis. Türkiye, which is included in the inflation set, is excluded from the emerging economies set in the policy rate analysis.
(3) To identify the underlying trend of inflation, we use approaches based on “methods of exclusion”, such as the B and C indices, as well as ""statistical methods"" such as Median and SATRIM inflation. Seasonally adjusted monthly changes and moving average changes of these core indicators are closely monitored to determine developments in the underlying trend. The underlying trend can be assessed from a broader perspective, including product groups that are considered to be related to the main drivers of inflation, the distribution and diffusion of price increases across products, and the degree of co-movement of the indicators monitored."

Press Release on Encouraging Conversion to Turkish Lira Time Deposits




The Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye has decided to provide incentive to domestic legal persons holding deposits and participation funds in the event that their FX and gold deposit accounts and participation funds are converted into Turkish lira time deposit accounts at the account holder’s request. 




To support financial stability by increasing the share of Turkish lira in total deposits/participation funds in the banking system, it was previously announced that domestic real persons holding deposits and participation funds would be provided with incentive in the event that they converted their FX and gold deposit accounts and participation funds into TL time deposit accounts.
Now, the CBRT has decided to provide incentive also to domestic legal persons holding deposits and participation funds in the event that they convert their FX and gold deposit accounts and participation funds into TL time deposit accounts and participation funds.

Participating Committee Members
Şahap Kavcıoğlu (Governor), Taha Çakmak, Mustafa Duman, Elif Haykır Hobikoğlu, Emrah Şener, Yusuf Tuna.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 14 percent.
The new variants and increasing geopolitical risks keep the downside risks to global economic activity alive and increases the uncertainty. Recovery in global demand, high course of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors and rise in transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. While the effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored, central banks in advanced economies assess that the rise in inflation on the back of rising energy prices and imbalances between supply and demand may last longer than previously anticipated. Accordingly, while monetary policy communication of central banks in advanced economies varies with their diverse outlook for economic activity, labor market and inflation expectations, they continue their supportive monetary stances and asset purchase programs.
Level of capacity utilization and other leading indicators show that domestic economic activity remains strong, with the help of robust external demand. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, current account balance is expected to post a surplus in 2022. Strengthening of the improvement trend in current account balance is important for price stability objective, and in that respect, developments in commercial and consumer loans are closely monitored.
Increase in inflation in the recent period has been driven by distorted pricing behavior due to unhealthy price formations in the foreign exchange market, supply side factors such as the rise in global food and agricultural commodity prices, supply constraints, and demand developments. The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken for sustainable price and financial stability along with the decline in inflation owing to the base effect. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. While cumulative impact of the recent policy decisions is being monitored, to create a foundation for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy framework is being conducted with the aim of prioritizing Turkish lira in all policy tools of the CBRT.
The CBRT will continue to use decisively all available instruments until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.
The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

2022,27 January 2022,Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting,"No: 2022-08
27 January 2022
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 20 January 2022
Inflation Developments
1.    Consumer prices rose by 13.58% in December, and annual inflation increased by 14.77 points to 36.08%. While this development was predominantly driven by the price increases in the core goods and food groups, annual inflation went up across all main groups. The impact of exchange rate developments was observed in the core goods group, in which the exchange rate pass-through is high, led by durable consumption goods, and prices in the food group excluding fresh fruits and vegetables rose substantially. The depreciation of the Turkish lira, the elevated course of commodity prices, and the lingering disruptions in supply chains caused the rise in producer prices to continue at an accelerated pace. Against this background, the annual inflation and the recent underlying trends of the B and C indices increased significantly.
2.    In December, prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 15.99%, and the group’s annual inflation surged by 16.69 points to 43.80%. Annual inflation rose to 39.83% in the unprocessed food group, and to 47.57% in the processed food group. In the unprocessed food group, seasonally adjusted data revealed a relatively milder monthly increase in prices of fresh fruits and vegetables whereas they pointed to significant price increases in the other unprocessed food group, particularly in items such as milk, white meat, eggs, potatoes, and red meat. Processed food prices posted a substantial monthly increase of 16.47% in December, with bread and cereals, oils and fats, cheese and other dairy products, and meat products in the lead. These developments were mostly driven by exchange rates, agricultural commodity price developments, and agricultural drought.
3.    Energy prices increased by 9.75% in December, and annual energy inflation rose by 10.79 points to 42.93%. Despite a decline in international energy prices in this period, domestic prices rose due to exchange rate developments. Solid fuels, bottled gas, and fuel stood out with the ongoing large price hikes they registered. The rise in energy inflation is expected to continue in a pronounced manner in January. This is due to the rebounding international energy prices as well as the price adjustments made in January in electricity and natural gas used in dwellings.
4.    Annual core goods inflation increased substantially by 22.19 points to 40.55%. Led by the durable goods group in which the exchange rate pass-through is high, annual inflation rose significantly across all subcategories due to the developments in the Turkish lira. Durable goods prices surged by 30.33% month-on-month, driven by large price increases in sub-items such as automobiles in particular, white goods, other electric and non-electric appliances, and furniture. The clothing and footwear group, in which seasonal sales began, posted a monthly price increase in this period contrary to the seasonal trend. Meanwhile, price hikes showed a generalized pattern across other core goods as well.
5.    Services prices rose by 5.27% in December and annual services inflation increased by 5.45 points to 22.33%. While annual inflation declined in communication, it increased in other subcategories, most visibly in restaurants-hotels. Driven by prices of catering services that increased due also to the negative outlook in food prices, and by prices of accommodation services that further increased in this period, annual inflation in the restaurants-hotels group reached 40.85% and continued to push up the services inflation. The rise in prices of transport services was led by increases in the intercity road transportation and air passenger transportation fares, while insurance charges as well as maintenance and repair prices with high exchange rate sensitivity were the leading drivers of the increase in prices of other services. According to seasonally adjusted data, the upward trend in rent inflation continued in December. The strong backward-indexation mechanism in the services sector keeps the risks for the upcoming period alive.
6.    In December, prices of tobacco products posted an increase of approximately TRY 2, driven by producer firms, adding approximately 0.49 points to consumer inflation. As of January, the last six months’ PPI increase in the alcoholic beverages and tobacco group was reflected in specific and minimum specific taxes, and cigarette prices rose on average by TRY 4 per pack in line with the tax increase. 
7.    According to the January results of the Survey of Market Participants, the current year-end inflation expectation stood at 29.75%, while the 12-month ahead inflation expectation increased by 3.98 points to 25.37%. The long-term data reveal that the revision in the five-year ahead inflation expectation remained relatively limited, and the expectation increased by 0.20 points to 8.92%.
Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks 
8.    Leading indicators show that the robust recovery in the global economy is sustained, albeit with some deceleration. Despite the recovery in global economic activity and the increase in the vaccination rate, the new variants and increasing geopolitical risks keep the downside risks to global economic activity alive and increase the uncertainty.
9.    Recovery in global demand, high course of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors and rise in transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. While the effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored, central banks in advanced economies assess that the rise in inflation on the back of rising energy prices and imbalances between supply and demand may last longer than previously anticipated. Accordingly, while monetary policy communication of central banks in advanced economies varies with their diverse outlook for economic activity, labor market and inflation expectations, they continue their supportive monetary stances and asset purchase programs.
10.    Outflows from emerging market debt securities markets stopped, and equity markets witnessed a surge in inflows. The volatility in long-term bond rates in advanced economies and the course of global financial conditions keep the risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies alive. The impact of such risks through portfolio flows channel towards Turkey are judged to prove to be relatively limited, considering the current levels of non-residents’ portfolio positions.
11.    Increase in inflation in the recent period has been driven by distorted pricing behavior due to unhealthy price formations in the foreign exchange market, supply side factors such as the rise in global food and agricultural commodity prices, supply constraints, and demand developments.
12.    Producer prices continued to rise markedly in December, largely due to energy and intermediate goods. Although prices were up across all sectors, their tendency was particularly higher for manufacturing industry excluding oil and base metals. In this period, prices of main inputs such as base metals, energy, textile, paper and chemical products increased significantly. The depreciation of the Turkish lira, higher commodity prices and ongoing supply chains disruptions were the main factors driving producer prices up. It is noteworthy that the indicators monitored for global supply chain pressures reached their highest level in history.
13.    Level of capacity utilization and other leading indicators show that domestic economic activity remains strong, with the help of robust external demand. Adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects, the Industrial Production Index (IPI) increased by 3.3% month-on-month in November, indicating that production continued to grow at an even stronger pace in the fourth quarter of the year. While production grew across all main industrial groups, the increases especially in durable and capital goods were stronger than the headline production growth. Industrial turnover indices suggest that both domestic and external demand are robust. As of December, investment tendencies of manufacturing industry firms for the next twelve months remain high.
14.    Despite the recent upsurge in new cases, the spread of domestic vaccination throughout the society helps keep services, tourism and related sectors, which have been adversely affected by the pandemic, strong, and leads to a more balanced composition in economic activity. In fact, according to data on credit card spending, the rate of increase is higher for services sectors that are severely hit by the pandemic. The retail sales volume and services turnover indices continue to rise at a stronger pace.
15.    The improvement in the labor market continues in line with the economic activity outlook. In November, employment grew across all sectors, and the labor force participation rate increased. Thus, in seasonally adjusted terms, the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 11.2%. Survey indicators and high-frequency data suggest that the improvement in the employment outlook and the positive course in the labor market continue. However, the effects of the large minimum wage hike and the likely increase in other wages to the labor market, especially to registered employment, are closely monitored.
16.    Favorable external demand conditions impact the current account balance positively. Current account balance ran a deficit of USD 2.7 billion in November while the current account deficit decreased by USD 0.9 billion to USD 14.3 billion in 12-month cumulative terms. Provisional foreign trade data suggest that exports remained strong in December, but imports continued to increase due to the large increase in energy imports. In addition to strong economic activity, the strong course of energy imports driven by high energy prices and the increased need for heating led to a deterioration in the foreign trade balance in the last quarter, whereas the real balancing in foreign trade excluding price effects continues. Despite this outlook in the foreign trade balance, the favorable course in services revenues continues to support the current account balance. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, current account balance is expected to post a surplus in 2022. Strengthening of the improvement trend in current account balance is important for price stability objective, and in that respect, developments in commercial and consumer loans are closely monitored.
Monetary Policy
17.    The monetary policy stance will be set by taking into account the evaluations on the source and permanence of risks, along with the extent to which they can be contained by monetary policy, and with a focus on achieving the sustainable price stability target, in a cautious manner.
18.    The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken for sustainable price and financial stability along with the decline in inflation owing to the base effect. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged.
19.    The cumulative impacts of the recent policy decisions are closely monitored and to create a foundation for sustainable price stability, a comprehensive policy framework review is being conducted with the aim of prioritizing Turkish lira in all policy tools of the CBRT. The focus of this process will be on developing policy instruments to support the improvement of Turkish lira deposits, to increase the Turkish lira-denominated assets in the collateral structure of OMO funding, to gradually reduce the volume of swaps and to strengthen foreign exchange reserves. In formulating the monetary policy towards achieving the price stability objective, the Committee will continue to follow an approach that also addresses risks to financial stability.
20.    Accordingly, the effects of Turkish lira liquidity developments on deposits and loan pricing, the lagged effects of exchange rate developments on inflation expectations, and the impact of the developments regarding FX-hedged deposit products on reverse currency substitution, exchange rate stability and price stability are being analyzed and necessary policy measures are being taken.
21.    The CBRT will continue to use decisively all available instruments until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability.
22.    Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.
23.    The Committee supports building strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders in order to achieve price stability.
24.    The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework."

Press Release on the Introduction of “YUVAM” Accounts




In order to encourage non-resident Turkish citizens to repatriate their savings to Türkiye, the Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye has decided to introduce “Deposit and Participation Scheme for Non-Resident Turkish Citizens (YUVAM)” accounts to be held in domestic banks.




In order to encourage Turkish citizens living abroad to repatriate their savings to Türkiye, to establish a savings framework allowing non-resident citizens to protect the value of their savings and leveraging the contributions of such savings to Türkiye’s economic development and balance of payments, the CBRT will introduce a facility under following conditions:

Non-resident Turkish citizens can benefit from this incentive if they transfer FX funds that they keep at banks abroad to FX deposit or participation accounts in USD, EUR and GBP in domestic banks and convert them to YUVAM accounts in TRY.
YUVAM accounts can have maturities of 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. 
While protecting the YUVAM account holders from the exchange rate volatility, the CBRT may provide additional returns varying by maturities.
The interest/profit share that will be accrued to YUVAM accounts by domestic banks will be compared to the sum of the change in exchange rates at the end of the maturity and the additional returns that will be paid by our Bank, and the higher amount will be paid to the deposit or participation account holder.
In case of withdrawal of money from the account before maturity, the account holder will not be able to benefit from the incentive.
The Communiqué and Implementation Instructions concerning YUVAM accounts have been published on our Bank's website (available only in Turkish).

2022,14 February 2022,Press Release on the Use of FAST System as a Payment Method in Purchase and Sale Transactions,"No: 2022-13
14 February 2022
Press Release on the Use of FAST System as a Payment Method in Purchase and Sale Transactions




Efforts are made to enable the use of the Instant and Continuous Transfer of Funds (FAST) System in purchase and sale transactions as a complementary payment method to cash payments. In business payments to be made using the “TR QR Code” integrated in the FAST System, up to TRY 10,000 can be paid at one time. 




The Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye (CBRT) established Türkiye’s QR code standards, called “TR QR Code”, on 21 August 2020 as part of intentional efforts to support innovative methods of executing and handling payments, and launched the FAST as a new generation instant payment system on 8 January 2021. The CBRT closely monitors any developments in strategic technologies for a swift adaptation of all kinds of technological innovations focusing on liraization in the payments ecosystem. Another initiative in progress in this respect is the “Digital Turkish Lira Collaboration Platform” announced on 15 September 2021 by the CBRT as part of its medium and long-term objective to make payments in lira the most practical, most effortless, cheapest and most inclusive payment instrument. 
The CBRT and the Interbank Card Center carry out efforts to ensure that the FAST System can be used as an alternative payment method complementing the cash payment method in purchase and sale transactions. In business payments to be made using the “TR QR Code”, up to TRY 10,000 can be paid at one time. With TR QR Code starting to be used widely in our daily lives, people will be able to make instant payments for their purchases via the FAST System infrastructure by scanning the payment QR code of the business with their mobile applications. 
Through the FAST System, which allows 24/7 instant transfer of funds, an average of 3.5 million payments are processed per day and transfers are completed in less than a second between customer accounts. Instead of IBANs, which are difficult to memorize and use, the Easy Addressing System allows users to initiate payments easily and rapidly using phone numbers, Turkish ID numbers or email addresses, and the number of users registered in this system has reached 15.5 million. Considering the great interest in the FAST System as well as the dynamic requirements of the payments ecosystem, the FAST transaction amount limit for money transfers, which is currently TRY 2,000, will be raised to TRY 5,000 as of 21 February 2022.
These developments are considered to provide major contributions to the Turkish economy in line with our digitalization target.
More details and fact sheets about the FAST System are available at https://fast.tcmb.gov.tr (in Turkish).

24 February 2022
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 17 February 2022
Inflation Developments
1.    In January, consumer prices increased by 11.10%, and annual inflation increased by 12.61 points to 48.69%. While exchange rates were more stable in January, international commodity prices significantly increased led by the energy group. While price increases in the food group spread across the entire group, fresh fruit and vegetable prices, which had been displaying a more moderate course recently, diverged negatively in January. The high course of international commodity prices and the ongoing supply problems led to a significant rise in producer prices. Against this background, the rise in annual inflation and in the recent underlying trends of the B and C indices continued in January.
2.    In January, prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 10.90%, and the group's annual inflation rose by 11.81 points to 55.61%. Due to fresh fruits and vegetables, annual inflation in the unprocessed food subgroup increased by 15.15 points to 54.98%, while annual inflation in processed food increased by 8.63 points to 56.20%. Prices in the fresh fruits and vegetables sub-group, which increased by 20.82% in January, exceeded seasonal averages. In the other unprocessed food subgroup, prices of milk and pulses items displayed remarkable increases while in the processed food group, cereal products, cheese and other dairy products, and fats and oils were the leading items. The VAT rate on basic food items was reduced from 8% to 1% in the middle of the month, thus, the effect of the discount will be reflected on the consumer price index in February and March.
3.    While energy prices increased by 27.41% in January, the group's annual inflation increased by 33.45 points to 76.38%. This rise was driven by developments in international energy commodity prices and administered items. As a result of the rise in international crude oil prices and the increase in SCT amounts, fuel prices increased by 23.35%. In January, residential electricity and natural gas tariffs increased by 69.96% and 21.35%, respectively, and municipal water tariffs also increased by 11.87%. Meanwhile, bottled gas prices increased by 11.28%. In this period, secondary effects of the rise in energy costs, particularly electricity, were also observed on consumer prices. While fuel prices continued to increase in February, the change introduced in grading in residential electricity tariffs and reductions in municipal water tariffs will positively affect energy prices in the near future.
4.    In January, annual core goods inflation increased by 7.94 points to 48.49%. Annual inflation rose in all subgroups. Prices of durable goods increased by 6.43%, and the group's annual inflation surged by 7.31 points to 56.24%. While white goods and furniture items stood out with high price increases, automobile prices displayed a more limited rise with the contribution of the tax base adjustment. A widespread rise was observed in other core goods prices and annual inflation rose to 51.23%. As seasonal sales in the clothing and footwear subgroups remained quite limited this year, the gradual uptrend in annual inflation continued in this subgroup. 
5.    Services prices rose by 7.89% in January, and annual services inflation increased by 7.23 points to 29.56%. While the uptick in annual inflation spread across the group, rises were more notable in subcategories excluding rent and communication. Items with administered prices and time-dependent pricing behavior stood out in January. Prices in the restaurants-hotels subcategory rose by 8.45% and annual inflation hit 50.40%. Also standing out in this period, prices in transportation services rose by 16.88%, and annual inflation became 39.31%. Following the recent developments in fuel prices and the high levels of inflation, significant increases were recorded in administered prices of intracity transport and passenger transport by railway as well as in cargo charges and road and air passenger transport fares. Among other services, health services that have a high backward-looking pricing tendency as well as maintenance-repair, recreation and culture, and insurance services were other items that pushed up prices. Seasonally-adjusted data suggest that the uptrend in rent inflation accelerated.
6.    Prices of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products increased by 21.90% in January. While the PPI increase pertaining to the second half of 2021 was reflected in specific taxes, producer prices-driven increases were also seen in alcoholic beverages. Against this background, annual inflation in this group reached 45.34%, adding 1.21 points to the increase in annual headline inflation in January.
7.    According to the February results of the Survey of Market Participants, the current year-end inflation expectation rose by 4.31 points to 34.06%, while the 12-month ahead inflation expectation dropped by 0.54 points to 24.83%. On the other hand, the upward revisions in the long-term inflation expectations continued in February, and the five-year ahead inflation expectation increased by 0.13 points to 9.05%.
Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks
8.    Leading indicators show that the robust recovery in the global economy is sustained, albeit with some deceleration. Despite the recovery in global economic activity and the increase in the vaccination rate, the variants and increasing geopolitical risks keep the downside risks to global economic activity alive and increase the uncertainty. 
9.    Recovery in global demand, high course of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors, particularly in energy, and high transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. Moreover, central banks in advanced economies assess that the rise in inflation may last longer than previously anticipated due to rising energy prices and imbalances between supply and demand. Accordingly, while monetary policy communication of central banks in advanced economies varies with their diverse outlook for economic activity, labor market and inflation expectations, they still continue their supportive monetary stances and asset purchase programs.
10.    The recent recovery in portfolio flows to emerging economies continues. However, the volatility in long-term bond rates in advanced economies and the course of global financial conditions keep the risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies alive. The impact of such risks through the portfolio flows channel towards Turkey is judged to prove to be relatively limited, considering the current levels of non-residents’ portfolio positions.
11.    Increase in inflation in the recent period has been driven by pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, supply-side factors such as the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices, supply constraints, and demand developments.
12.    Annual producer inflation maintained its upward trend in January. While prices were up across all sectors, the underlying trend of the manufacturing industry excluding oil and base metals rose. Annual inflation increased across all main industrial groups, most notably in energy and intermediate goods. The most dramatic monthly increase was recorded in durable consumption goods. The negative outlook for commodity prices, energy in particular, ongoing supply chain disruptions, and high transportation costs were the factors exerting pressure on producer prices. With especially energy and non-energy commodity (metal and agriculture in particular) prices posting a substantial increase in US dollar terms in January, external price pressures remained strong. 
13.    Level of capacity utilization and other leading indicators show that domestic economic activity remains strong, with the help of robust external demand. Adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects, the Industrial Production Index (IPI) increased by 1.6% month-on-month and by 4.3% quarter-on-quarter in December, indicating that production continued to grow at an even stronger pace in the fourth quarter of the year. Industrial production grew by 16.4% throughout 2021. Industrial turnover indices suggest that both external and domestic demand were robust in the last quarter. Despite a month-on-month decline in that period, the retail sales volume index remained strong above its trend throughout the quarter.  
14.    High-frequency data indicate that the natural gas and electricity outages in the last ten days of January had a limited impact on production and foreign trade indicators. Meanwhile, investment tendencies of manufacturing industry firms for the next twelve months were high in January. Despite the recent upsurge in new cases, the spread of vaccination throughout domestic population allows the services, tourism and related sectors, which have been adversely affected by the pandemic, to maintain their strength and leads to a more balanced composition in economic activity. As a matter of fact, the credit card spending in services sectors that are severely hit by the pandemic continued to hover above the trend.
15.    The improvement in the labor market continues in line with the economic activity outlook. In December, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 11.2%. Employment grew across all sectors, and the labor force participation rate increased. Survey indicators and high-frequency data suggest that the improvement in the employment outlook and the positive course in the labor market continue. 
16.    The strong course of energy imports in the recent period has been limiting the improvement in the current account balance. The current account balance ran a deficit of USD 3.8 billion in December, and the current account deficit for 2021 stood at USD 14.9 billion. While exports remained strong thanks to favorable external demand conditions in the last quarter of the year, imports increased due to robust economic activity, the rise in commodity, particularly energy prices and the increase in energy demand.  The real balancing in foreign trade excluding price effects continued. Provisional foreign trade data suggest that the energy-driven increase in imports will persist in January. Despite this outlook in the foreign trade balance, the favorable course in services revenues continues to support the current account balance. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, current account balance is expected to post a surplus in 2022. Strengthening of the improving trend in current account balance is important for price stability. The Committee assesses that extending long-term Turkish lira investment credit will play a significant role in achieving this target.
Monetary Policy
17.    The monetary policy stance will be set by taking into account the evaluations on the source and permanence of risks, along with the extent to which they can be contained by monetary policy, and with a focus on achieving the sustainable price stability target, in a cautious manner.
18.    The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken and decisively pursued for sustainable price and financial stability along with the decline in inflation owing to the base effect. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. 
19.    While cumulative impact of the recent policy decisions is being monitored, to create a foundation for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy framework is being conducted with the aim of encouraging permanent liraization in all policy tools of the CBRT. The focus of this process will be on developing policy instruments to support the improvement of Turkish lira deposits, to increase the Turkish lira-denominated assets in the collateral structure of OMO funding, to gradually reduce the volume of swaps and to strengthen foreign exchange reserves. In formulating the monetary policy towards achieving the sustainable price stability objective, the Committee will continue to follow a liraization oriented approach that also addresses risks to financial stability.
20.    Accordingly, the effects of the liquidity and distribution developments of Turkish lira on deposits and loan pricing, the lagged effects of exchange rate developments on inflation expectations, and the impact of the developments regarding FX-protected deposit products on reverse currency substitution, the depth and stability of the foreign exchange market and price stability are being analyzed and necessary policy measures are being taken.
21.    The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively within the framework of liraization strategy until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5% target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. 
22.    Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.
23.    The Committee supports building strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders in order to achieve price stability.
24.    The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework."

Participating Committee Members
Şahap Kavcıoğlu (Governor), Taha Çakmak, Mustafa Duman, Elif Haykır Hobikoğlu, Emrah Şener, Yusuf Tuna.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 14 percent.
Geopolitical risks that evolved into conflict and the variants, keep the downside risks to regional and global economic activity alive and further increases the uncertainty. Recovery in global demand, high course of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors that have become more evident particulary in energy, and high transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. Moreover, central banks in advanced economies assess that the rise in inflation may last longer than previously anticipated due to rising energy prices and imbalances between supply and demand. Accordingly, while monetary policy communication of central banks in advanced economies varies with their diverse outlook for economic activity, labor market and inflation expectations, they still continue their supportive monetary stances and asset purchase programs at a slower pace.
Level of capacity utilization and other leading indicators show that domestic economic activity remains strong, with the help of robust external demand even some regional differences emerge. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, risks on current account balance due to energy prices are closely monitored. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability. The Committee also assesses that the credit growth including the long-term investment loans and targeted usage of accessed funds for real economic activity is important for financial stability.
Increase in inflation in the recent period has been driven by rising energy costs resulting from the heightened regional conflict, temporary effects of pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, supply side factors such as the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices, supply constraints, and demand developments. The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken and decisively pursued for sustainable price and financial stability along with the decline in inflation owing to the base effect and the resolution of the ongoing regional conflict. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. While cumulative impact of the recent policy decisions is being monitored, to create an institutional basis for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy framework continues with the aim of encouraging permanent and strengthened liraization in all policy tools of the CBRT.
The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively within the framework of liraization strategy until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs.

24 March 2022
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 17 March 2022
Inflation Developments
1.    In February, consumer prices increased by 4.81%, and annual inflation rose by 5.75 points to 54.44%. The exchange rate was more stable in February, while the upward trend in commodity prices became evident following geopolitical developments. The increase in annual food inflation reflected the developments in international markets. Domestic fuel prices were adversely affected by the increase in crude oil prices, and this item became the main driver of energy inflation. In line with the outlook for energy and food, restaurants-hotels and transportation pushed services inflation up. In core goods, price increases slowed down in February but annual inflation continued to rise. Both the developments in international commodity markets and ongoing supply problems caused producer prices to soar. Against this background, annual inflation of indicators B and C increased in February.
2.    Food and nonalcoholic beverage prices increased by 8.41% in February, and the group's annual inflation rose by 8.86 points to 64.47%. Annual inflation in unprocessed food increased by 14.95 points to 69.93%, while annual inflation in processed food increased by 3.22 points to 59.42%. Rising at a rate higher than seasonal averages with 32.16%, prices of fresh fruits and vegetables were the key driver of the annual unprocessed food inflation in February. Other unprocessed food items, including red meat, pulses, dried nuts and potatoes increased notably, while fats and oils, sugar and sugar-related products and grain products in the processed food group rose significantly as well. International agricultural commodity prices seem to have a negative impact on these items, directly or indirectly. The VAT reduction of food items from 8% to 1% in mid-February prevented a more negative outlook, while leading indicators point to a more positive outlook for the food group in March, supported by the prolonged effect of the VAT cut.
3.    While energy prices rose by 4.00% in February, annual inflation in the energy group increased by 6.60 points to 82.98%. Recent geopolitical developments led to a global upsurge in prices of crude oil, natural gas and solid fuel, aggravating the pressure on domestic prices. Against this background, price hikes were widespread in February, with fuel oil prices soaring notably by 10.10%. On the other hand, the grading in residential electricity tariffs was adjusted, which pulled electricity prices down by 4.84%. In addition, the VAT rate was reduced in early March. Accordingly, electricity prices are expected to decelerate further in March.
4.    In February, annual core goods inflation increased by 5.89 points to 54.38%. Annual inflation has been high across all subgroups in this period. Prices of durable goods increased relatively mildly by 3.27% compared to previous months, and the annual inflation in this group rose by 4.70 points to 60.94%. Prices of white goods and furniture items increased markedly, while automobile prices maintained a moderate course. In other core goods, annual inflation reached 61.89% with an increase of 10.66 points. Price hikes in other core goods were widespread, with medicine prices stood out due to backward exchange rate indexing. Prices of clothing and footwear registered a slight increase by 0.23% in February, contrary to seasonal norms, and annual inflation in this subgroup was calculated as 26.55%.
5.    Services prices rose by 3.63% in February, and annual services inflation increased by 3.33 points to 32.89%. Annual inflation increased across all subgroups, but more markedly in transport and hotels-restaurants. Prices in restaurants-hotels increased by 4.54% due to catering services, and annual inflation reached 55.20%, owing to the increases in the costs of main inputs such as food and energy. Fuel price changes also had an adverse impact on transport services led by intercity passenger transport by road and urban passenger transport by bus. Prices in this group went up by 5.73%, and annual transport inflation rose to 46.87%. The subgroup of other services also saw widespread price increases, particularly in health and education services. Seasonally adjusted monthly increases in rent remained high.
6.    According to the March results of the Survey of Market Participants, the current year-end inflation expectation rose by 6.41 points to 40.47%, while the 12-month-ahead inflation expectation increased by 1.60 points to 26.43%. On the other hand, long-term inflation expectations lost its upward momentum in March, and the five-year ahead inflation expectation dropped by 0.24 points to 8.81%.
Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks
7.    Leading indicators show that the robust recovery in the global economy is sustained, albeit with some deceleration. However, geopolitical risks that evolved into conflict and the variants, keep the downside risks to regional and global economic activity alive and further increases the uncertainty.
8.    Recovery in global demand, high course of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors that have become more evident particularly in energy, and high transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. Moreover, central banks in advanced economies assess that the rise in inflation may last longer than previously anticipated due to rising energy prices and imbalances between supply and demand. Accordingly, while monetary policy communication of central banks in advanced economies varies with their diverse outlook for economic activity, labor market and inflation expectations, they still continue their supportive monetary stances and asset purchase programs at a slower pace.
9.    Portfolio flows to emerging economies suggest that inflows to equity markets have recently continued albeit at a slower pace and bond markets have posted outflows. The volatility in long-term bond rates in advanced economies and the course of global financial conditions keep the risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies alive. The impact of such risks through the portfolio flows channel towards Turkey is judged to prove to be relatively limited, considering the current levels of non-residents’ portfolio positions.
10.    Increase in inflation in the recent period has been driven by rising energy costs resulting from the heightened regional conflict, temporary effects of pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, supply side factors such as the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices, supply constraints, and demand developments.
11.    Despite the mild course in exchange rates, the commodity price increases that became more evident due to lingering supply-side problems and the geopolitical unrest affected producer prices negatively in February. While annual inflation increased across all subgroups, the energy group diverged negatively in line with international developments. Across subgroups, monthly changes were remarkable in electricity-gas production and distribution, crude oil-natural gas, main pharmaceutical, wood and construction related products.
12.    Economic activity remained strong in the final quarter of 2021, with the help of both domestic and external demand. In this period, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rose by 9.1% on an annual basis while it increased by 1.5% quarter-on-quarter in seasonally and calendar-adjusted terms. Accordingly, overall 2021 growth became 11%. On the production side, industrial and services sectors were the main drivers of annual and quarterly growth in the final quarter whereas the construction sector limited growth. On the expenditures side, the main driver of quarterly growth was final domestic demand led by private consumption while net exports contributed to quarterly growth by 0.9 points.  
13.    Level of capacity utilization and other leading indicators show that domestic economic activity remains strong, with the help of robust external demand even some regional differences emerge. Adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects, industrial production declined by 2.4% month-on-month in January. However, it is assessed that electricity and natural gas outages in industrial plants in the last ten days of the month were effective in this decline and the production remains strong when these effects were excluded. In terms of export intensity, industrial production is stronger than implied by the general index in exporting sectors excluding other transportation. Industrial turnover indices also reveal that external demand continued to support industrial production in January. On the other hand, retail sales volume indices declined also in January, indicating a loss of momentum in domestic demand. 
14.    High-frequency data suggest that production and foreign trade indicators posted some recovery in February after registering declines due to natural gas and electricity outages in January. As of February, investment tendencies of manufacturing industry firms for the next twelve months were high. Firms’ existing domestic and external orders as well as expectations for future orders reveal that external demand remains strong while domestic demand is expected to increase although it has declined slightly. On the other hand, the credit card spending increased substantially on a monthly basis in February. 
15.    Developments in the labor market are in tandem with the outlook of economic activity. In January, employment decreased by a mere 0.1% compared to the previous month. With the effect of the decrease in the participation rate, seasonally adjusted total unemployment rate remained unchanged month-on-month and was recorded at 11.4%. Survey indicators and high-frequency data indicate that the positive outlook in the labor market is maintained.
16.    The recent strong course of energy imports has been affecting the current account balance adversely. While the current account deficit was USD 7.1 billion in January, the annualized current account deficit increased by USD 5.3 billion to USD 20.2 billion. Provisional foreign trade data indicated that, the strong course of exports in February continued recently despite regional differences, while imports increased due to high energy and commodity prices. In this context, regional losses occur in exports in the short term due to the heightened military conflict. It is observed that, short-term loses are largely compensated by the increase in exports to other countries thanks to the dynamic capacity and market diversification flexibility of the exporting firms. Despite this outlook in the foreign trade balance, the favorable course in services revenues continues to support the current account balance. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, risks on current account balance due to energy prices are closely monitored. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability.
Monetary Policy
17.    The monetary policy stance will be determined by taking into account the evaluations on the source and permanence of risks, along with the extent to which they can be contained by monetary policy, and with a focus on achieving the sustainable price stability target, in a cautious manner.
18.    In formulating the monetary policy towards achieving the sustainable price stability objective, a liraization- oriented approach that also addresses risks to financial stability will continue to be followed. The Committee also assesses that credit growth including long-term investment loans and the targeted use of accessed funds for real economic activity is important for financial stability.
19.    The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken and decisively pursued for achieving sustainable price and financial stability once global peace is restored and base effects are ceased. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. 
20.    While cumulative impact of the recent policy decisions is being monitored, to create an institutional basis for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy framework continues with the aim of encouraging permanent and strengthened liraization in all policy tools of the CBRT. The focus of this process will be on developing policy instruments to support the improvement of Turkish lira deposits, to increase the Turkish lira-denominated assets in the collateral structure of OMO funding, to gradually reduce the volume of swaps and to strengthen foreign exchange reserves.
21.    Accordingly, the effects of the liquidity and distribution developments of Turkish lira on deposits and loan pricing, the lagged effects of exchange rate developments on inflation expectations, and the impact of the developments regarding FX-protected deposit products on reverse currency substitution, the depth and stability of the foreign exchange market and price stability are being analyzed and necessary policy measures are being taken.

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 14 percent.
The ongoing geopolitical risks keep the downside risks to regional and global economic activity alive and increase the uncertainty. Concern over global food security, high course of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors that have become more evident particulary in energy, and high transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. Moreover, central banks in advanced economies assess that the rise in inflation may last longer than previously anticipated due to rising energy prices and imbalances between supply and demand. Accordingly, while monetary policy communication of central banks in advanced economies varies with their diverse outlook for economic activity, labor market and inflation expectations, they still continue their supportive monetary stances and asset purchase programs at a slower pace.

Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability. The Committee also assesses that the credit growth including the long-term investment loans and targeted usage of accessed funds for real economic activity is important for financial stability. In this context, the Committee decided to strengthen the macroprudential policy set.
Increase in inflation in the recent period has been driven by rising energy costs resulting from geopolitical developments, temporary effects of pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, strong negative supply shocks caused by the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices. The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken and decisively pursued for sustainable price and financial stability along with the decline in inflation owing to the base effect and the resolution of the ongoing regional conflict.

Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 14 April 2022
Inflation Developments
1.    In March, consumer prices increased by 5.46%, and annual inflation surged by 6.70 points to 61.14%. The upward trend in international commodity prices since the beginning of the year has become more evident in this period amid geopolitical developments, with historic monthly rebounds in March, primarily in energy, metal, food and agricultural commodities. These developments had an impact on domestic energy and food prices in particular. In core goods, annual inflation remained flat in clothing and footwear, but rose in other subgroups. In the services group, developments in transport and restaurants-hotels stood out in line with the outlook for energy and food prices. Stronger increases in international commodity prices and supply chain disruptions continued to drive producer prices up. Against this background, annual inflation of B and C indices increased further in March.
2.    Food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 4.73% in March, and the group’s annual inflation rose by 5.86 points to 70.33%.  In March, the FAO international food price index in US dollars soared by 12.64%, hitting its all-time high. While this upsurge was driven by cereal, vegetable oil and meat prices, the prices of sugar and dairy products also increased substantially. Significant increases in food and agricultural commodity prices due to geopolitical developments exerted pressure on domestic prices, whereas the carry-over effects of the VAT cut in staple food items averted a more negative outlook. In March, annual inflation continued to rise in both unprocessed and processed food groups, more visibly in unprocessed food. In unprocessed food, seasonally-adjusted prices of fresh fruits and vegetables remained relatively flat, whereas in other unprocessed food group, red and white meat prices, which were affected by higher feed prices amid rising external price pressures, diverged negatively along with potato and egg prices. In processed food group, the increase in bread and cereals was mainly determined by wheat prices, while fats and oils, meat products, sugar and non-alcoholic beverages also stood out. Leading indicators suggest that the rise in food inflation persists due to supply constraints and the lagged effects of the increase in international food and agricultural commodity prices.
3.    Energy prices increased by 11.01% in March, and the group’s annual inflation rose by 19.96 points to 102.94%. Due to accelerating international energy prices amid geopolitical risks, fuels, bottled gas and solid fuels saw significant month-on-month increases. Meanwhile, the decline in residential electricity prices with the increase in the gradual tariff limit and the VAT reduction restrained energy inflation.
4.    Prices of core goods rose by 4.56% in March, and annual core goods inflation increased by 4.81 points to 59.19%. Annual inflation remained flat in the clothing and footwear group, standing at 26.54%. In this period, prices of durable goods accelerated somewhat by 5.09%, primarily led by developments in automobile and furniture items. The price increase in the other core goods group remained strong, with a monthly increase of 5.36%. The VAT reduction on hygiene products from 18% to 8% in April is expected to affect the other core goods inflation positively.
5.    Services prices increased by 4.19% in March, and annual services inflation went up by 3.83 points to 36.72%. Annual inflation rose across all subgroups, most notably in transport and restaurants-hotels. Fuel price increases weighed on transport services. The price increases in intercity passenger transport by road as well as in urban passenger transport by bus and railway were notable in this development. The effect of fuel price developments on transport services is expected to persist also in April. Increases in the costs of main inputs had a negative impact on the restaurants-hotels group, and annual inflation in this group reached 60.40%. The increases in international commodity prices, which accelerated significantly due to geopolitical developments, do not only affect tradable goods but also push services inflation up particularly through fuel and food prices. In the subgroups of other services, price increases spread across sub-items, most notably in education services, where backward indexation is common, and insurance. On the other hand, seasonally adjusted data indicate that the monthly increases in rent slowed down.
6.    Prices of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products increased by 3.91% in March due to the producer firms driven increases in cigarette prices, and annual inflation rose to 51.43%. This rise will have carry-over effects in April as well.
7.    According to the April results of the Survey of Market Participants, the current year-end inflation expectation rose by 5.97 points to 46.44%, while the 12-month-ahead inflation expectation increased by 1.98 points to 28.41%. Currently, the 24-month-ahead and five-year-ahead inflation expectations stand at 17.68% and 9.23%, respectively.
Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks
8.    Leading indicators show that the recovery in the global economy is sustained with some deceleration. However, the ongoing geopolitical risks keep the downside risks to regional and global economic activity alive and increase the uncertainty.
9.    Concern over global food security, high course of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors that have become more evident particularly in energy, and high transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. Moreover, central banks in advanced economies assess that the rise in inflation may last longer than previously anticipated due to rising energy prices and imbalances between supply and demand. Accordingly, while monetary policy communication of central banks in advanced economies varies with their diverse outlook for economic activity, labor market and inflation expectations, they still continue their supportive monetary stances and asset purchase programs at a slower pace.
10.    Portfolio flows to emerging economies moved in tandem with the risk appetite and decreased until the last week of March before rebounding with equity markets in the lead. However, the volatility in long-term bond rates in advanced economies and the course of global financial conditions keep the risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies alive. The impact of such risks through the portfolio flows channel towards Turkey is judged to prove to be relatively limited, considering the current levels of non-residents’ portfolio positions.
11.    Increase in inflation in the recent period has been driven by rising energy costs resulting from geopolitical developments, temporary effects of pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, strong negative supply shocks caused by the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices.
12.    Increases in commodity prices that grew stronger amid geopolitical developments accompanied by ongoing supply problems weighed further on producer prices in March. As a result, annual producer inflation rose across all subcategories, especially in energy prices. Adverse impacts of high levels recorded in energy prices became more evident. Across subcategories, monthly price changes were more noticeable in refined petroleum products, construction-related products, metals, production and distribution of electricity and gas, main pharmaceuticals, tobacco and food products.
13.    Level of capacity utilization and other leading indicators show that domestic economic activity remains strong, with the help of more robust external demand, even if some regional differences emerge. Adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects, industrial production rose by 4.4% month-on-month in February, indicating that production losses stemming from electricity and natural gas outages in January were compensated. Thus, production rose by 2% quarter-on-quarter as of January and February averages. Monthly increase in production spread across the sectors, while industrial production was stronger in exporting sectors. Industrial turnover indices also reveal that external demand continued to support industrial production. On the other hand, the January-February average of retail sales volume indices decreased compared to the previous quarter, indicating to a loss of momentum in domestic demand.
14.    As of March, investment tendencies of manufacturing industry firms for the next twelve months were high. In the first quarter, firms’ registered domestic and export orders as well as expectations for future orders reveal that external demand remains strong, while domestic demand lost pace. In fact, credit card spending indicates some recovery in the February-March period, yet fell slightly on a quarterly basis.
15.    Developments in the labor market are in tandem with the outlook of economic activity. In February, seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate stood at 10.7%. As of February, employment increased by 0.7% compared to the previous quarter. The participation rate edged down by 0.2 points to 52.2% in February, and seasonally adjusted total unemployment rate in terms of January-February averages has declined by 0.2 points to 10.9% compared to the previous quarter. Survey indicators and high-frequency data indicate that the positive outlook in the labor market is maintained.
16.    The recent strong course of energy imports has been affecting the current account balance adversely. The current account balance posted a deficit of USD 5.2 billion in February, while the annualized current account deficit increased by USD 2.7 billion to USD 21.8 billion. Provisional data on foreign trade indicate that exports remained high in March, while imports increased due to high energy and commodity prices. In this context, regional losses occur in exports in the short term due to the heightened military conflict. It is observed that these loses are compensated by the increase in exports to other countries thanks to the dynamic capacity and market diversification flexibility of exporting firms. Despite this outlook in the foreign trade balance, the favorable course in services revenues continues to support the current account balance. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, risks on current account balance due to energy prices continue. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability.
Monetary Policy
17.    The monetary policy stance will be determined by taking into account the evaluations on the source and permanence of risks, along with the extent to which they can be contained by monetary policy, and with a focus on achieving the sustainable price stability target, in a cautious manner.
18.    In formulating the monetary policy towards achieving the sustainable price stability objective, a liraization-oriented approach that also addresses risks to financial stability will continue to be followed. The Committee also assesses that credit growth including long-term investment loans and the targeted usage of accessed funds for real economic activity are important for financial stability. In this context, the Committee decided to strengthen the macroprudential policy set.
19.    The Committee expects the disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken and decisively pursued for sustainable price and financial stability along with the decline in inflation owing to the base effect and the resolution of the ongoing regional conflict. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged.
20.    While cumulative impact of the recent policy decisions is being monitored, to create an institutional basis for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy framework continues with the aim of encouraging permanent and strengthened liraization in all policy tools of the CBRT. The focus of this process will be on developing policy instruments to support the improvement of Turkish lira deposits, to increase Turkish lira-denominated assets in the collateral structure of OMO funding, to gradually reduce the volume of swaps, and to strengthen foreign exchange reserves.
21.    Accordingly, the effects of liquidity and distribution developments of the Turkish lira on deposits and loan pricing, the lagged effects of exchange rate developments on inflation expectations, and the impact of the developments regarding FX-protected deposit products on reverse currency substitution, the depth and stability of the foreign exchange market and price stability are being analyzed and necessary policy measures are being taken.
22.    The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively within the framework of the liraization strategy until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term target of 5 percent is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability.
23.    Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, the continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and of the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and a durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.
24.    The Committee supports building strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders in order to achieve price stability.
25.    The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework."

Press Release on Reserve Requirements




In line with its main objective of price stability and in the scope of efforts towards supporting financial stability and encouraging liraization, the Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye has strengthened its macroprudential policy toolkit and revised the reserve requirement regulation.




As stipulated in Article 4 of the Law No.1211 on the Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye, one of the fundamental duties of the Central Bank is to introduce reserve requirements on appropriate on- and off-balance sheet items of banks and other financial institutions. With this new regulation, reserve requirements, which used to be applied to the liability side of balance sheets, will also be applied to the asset side of balance sheets in order to strengthen the macroprudential policy toolkit.
In this context, banks’ and financing companies’ TL-denominated commercial cash loans shall be subject to reserve requirements, excluding the following loans: 

Loans extended to businesses that are under the scope of SMEs
Tradesmen loans
Export and investment loans
Agricultural loans
Loans extended to institutions and organizations, state economic enterprises and their establishments, subsidiaries and affiliates included in tables (I), (II), (III) and (IV) in the annex of the Law No.5018 on Public Finance Management and Control Law 
Commercial credit cards
Loans extended to financial institutions

Accordingly, it has been decided that:

Commercial loans, which have been extended in four-week periods since 1 April 2022, shall be subject to a reserve requirement of 10% of the said loans during the maintenance periods of four-week. 
For banks with a loan growth rate above 20% by 31 May 2022 compared to 31 December 2021: the difference between their outstanding loan balances on 31 March 2022 and 31 December 2021 shall be subject to reserve requirements of 20% of this difference, for a period of 6 months. 

Moreover, it has been decided to differentiate FX deposit/participation fund reserve requirement ratios according to the conversion rate of real person’s FX accounts to TRY accounts, and accordingly, based on this conversion rate, it has been decided to implement an additional reserve requirement of: 

500 basis points for banks with a conversion rate below 5%, and
300 basis points for banks with a conversion rate between 5% and 10%. 

This application will be effective from the calculation date of 27 May 2022 with the maintenance period starting on 10 June 2022.
Meanwhile, reserve requirement ratios of financing companies, which were 0%, have now been set at the same level as banks, and their liabilities to domestic banks have been included in the scope of reserve requirements. This amendment will be effective from the calculation date of 29 April 2022 with the maintenance period starting on 13 May 2022.

Şahap Kavcıoğlu (Governor), Taha Çakmak, Mustafa Duman, Elif Haykır Hobikoğlu, Emrah Şener, Yusuf Tuna.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 14 percent.
The escalation of ongoing geopolitical risks keeps the downside risks to regional and global economic activity alive and increase the uncertainty. Increasing concern over global food security driven by trade restrictions, high course of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors that have become more evident particularly in energy and food, and high transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. Moreover, central banks in advanced economies emphasize that the rise in inflation may last longer than previously anticipated due to rising energy prices and imbalances between supply and demand. Accordingly, while monetary policy steps of central banks in advanced economies vary with their diverse outlook for economic activity, labor market and inflation expectations, they still continue their supportive monetary stances.

2022,2 June 2022,Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting,"No: 2022-27
2 June 2022
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 26 May 2022
Inflation Developments
1.    In April, consumer prices increased by 7.25%, and annual inflation surged by 8.83 points to 69.97%. The rise in annual consumer inflation spread across sub-categories, which were driven mostly by the food group, followed by energy and services. Food inflation remained on an upward track due to international price developments, rising input costs and unfavorable supply conditions. Energy inflation was shaped by the developments in administered items, while annual inflation in services recorded increases across sub-categories, with transport and restaurants-hotels in the lead. In core goods, annual inflation increased in durable goods, but declined in other sub-groups. The VAT reduction introduced to the main hygiene products curbed inflation in other core goods. The persisting high course in international commodity prices, increases in domestic energy prices and ongoing disruptions in supply chains continued to drive producer prices up. Against this background, annual inflation of B and C indices continued to increase.
2.    Prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 13.38% in April, and became the main driver of consumer inflation. Accordingly, annual inflation in this group went up by 18.77 points to 89.10%. High levels in international agricultural commodity prices, elevated input costs and supply conditions led to overall price increases in April, and annual inflation reached 100.67% in the unprocessed food group and 78.09% in the processed food group. On the unprocessed food front, rises in seasonally adjusted prices of fresh fruits and vegetables were noticeable. Meanwhile, in the other unprocessed food subcategory, red and white meat, which were affected adversely by feed prices, as well as potatoes and rice stood out with surging prices. Milk prices increased amid the adjustment in raw milk reference price. Negative effects of price increases in unprocessed food items were reflected on the related processed food items. While annual inflation in bread and cereals reached 85.81%, price increases in cheese and other dairy products, sugar and related products, fats and oils, non-alcoholic beverages and meat products were notable.
3.    Energy prices increased by 7.62% in April, and the group’s annual inflation rose by 15.26 points to 118.20%. This rise was driven mainly by natural gas and tap water prices among administered items, while fuel, solid fuel and bottled gas saw further price increases. Even though international energy prices excluding natural gas had posted a slight fall in April, this was only temporary and energy prices rebounded in May due to geopolitical developments.
4.    In April, prices of services increased by 4.74%, and annual inflation went up by 5.46 points to 42.18% in this group. Annual inflation rose across all subgroups, most notably in transport and restaurants-hotels. Annual inflation in the intercity and urban passenger transport group increased to 78.00% while that in restaurants-hotels group reached 69.26%. Price increases spread across items in other services. Meanwhile, seasonally adjusted data indicate that the monthly rise in rents remained flat in April.
5.    The annual core goods inflation increased by 2.39 points to 61.58%. Annual inflation increased in durable goods, while it decreased in other sub-groups. In April, prices of durable goods rose by 5.11%, mainly driven by the rise in furniture prices, followed by automobiles and white goods prices. In other core goods group, the rise in prices of housing maintenance and repair, recreation and culture, and household products was remarkable, while the VAT reduction in basic hygiene products mostly reflected on prices, thereby preventing a more negative outlook. In the clothing and footwear group, the monthly price increments for the new season remained lower than those in the previous year, thus annual inflation in this group decreased by 0.79 points to 25.75%.
6.    In April, prices of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products increased by 4.02%, and annual inflation of the group rose to 56.38%. The rise was affected by lingering effects of price increases in cigarette prices in March implemented by producer firms. The uptrend is expected to continue due to the increase in cigarette prices imposed by producer firms in May.
7.    The May results of the Survey of Market Participants suggest that inflation expectations have increased for all maturities, being more evident in shorter maturities. The current year-end inflation expectation rose by 11.48 points to 57.92%, while the 12-month-ahead inflation expectation increased by 4.87 points to 33.28%. Currently, the 24-month-ahead and five-year-ahead inflation expectations stand at 19.54% and 9.96%, respectively.
Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks
8.    Leading indicators show that the recovery in the global economy is sustained with some deceleration. However, the escalation of ongoing geopolitical risks keeps the downside risks to regional and global economic activity alive and increase the uncertainty.
9.    Increasing concern over global food security driven by trade restrictions, high course of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors that have become more evident particularly in energy and food, and high transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. Moreover, central banks in advanced economies emphasize that the rise in inflation may last longer than previously anticipated due to rising energy prices and imbalances between supply and demand. Accordingly, while monetary policy steps of central banks in advanced economies vary with their diverse outlook for economic activity, labor market and inflation expectations, they still continue their supportive monetary stances.
10.    Regarding portfolio flows to emerging economies, bond and equity markets both registered outflows in May in tandem with the global risk appetite. However, the volatility in long-term bond rates in advanced economies and the course of global financial conditions keep the risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies alive. The impact of such risks through the portfolio flows channel towards Türkiye is judged to prove to be relatively limited, considering the current levels of non-residents’ portfolio positions.
11.    Increase in inflation is driven by rising energy costs resulting from geopolitical developments, temporary effects of pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, strong negative supply shocks caused by the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices.
12.    Elevated levels of commodity prices, disruptions in supply chains, and increases in domestic energy costs continued to affect producer prices. According to main industrial groupings, annual inflation remained almost flat in intermediate goods, but increased in all other subcategories.
13.    Level of capacity utilization and other leading indicators show that domestic economic activity remains strong, with the help of more robust external demand even some regional differences emerge. Despite having fallen by 1.8% month-on-month in March, seasonal and calendar adjusted industrial production remained strong. Thus, production grew by 2% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter. While production posted a quarterly growth across all sectors, industrial production was stronger in exporting sectors. Industrial turnover indices also reveal that external demand continued to support industrial production. On the other hand, retail sales volume indices were down in the first quarter compared to the previous quarter, indicating a loss of momentum in domestic demand.
14.    As of May, investment tendencies of manufacturing industry firms for the next twelve months were high. Firms’ registered domestic and external orders and future order expectations reveal that external demand remains strong in the second quarter. On the other hand, card spending data point to a recovery in domestic demand for the April-May period.
15.    Developments in the labor market are in tandem with the outlook of economic activity. Although in the first quarter employment increased by 0.7% compared to the previous quarter, the seasonally adjusted total unemployment rate rose by 0.1 percentage points to 11.4% due to the increase in the participation rate. In this period, industrial employment grew on the back of external demand, while services employment increased amid stronger tourism. Non-farm employment rose despite the decline in construction employment. Survey indicators and high-frequency data indicate that the positive outlook in the labor market is maintained.
16.    The recent strong course of energy imports has been affecting the current account balance. The Current Account Balance (CAB) registered a deficit of USD 5.6 billion in March 2022, while the annualized current account deficit surged by USD 2.2 billion to USD 24.2 billion. According to provisional external trade data, exports remained strong in April, while imports remained high due to energy and commodity prices. On the other hand, it is observed that short-term regional losses caused by the conflict are compensated by the increase in exports to other countries thanks to the dynamic capacity and market diversification flexibility of exporting firms. Despite this outlook in the foreign trade balance, the favorable course in services revenues continues to support the current account balance. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, risks on current account balance due to energy prices continue. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability.
Monetary Policy
17.    The monetary policy stance will be determined by taking into account the evaluations on the source and permanence of risks, along with the extent to which they can be contained by monetary policy, and with a focus on achieving the sustainable price stability target, in a cautious manner.
18.    In formulating the monetary policy towards achieving the sustainable price stability objective, a liraization-oriented approach that also addresses risks to financial stability will continue to be followed. The Committee also assesses that the credit growth including the long-term investment loans and targeted usage of accessed funds for real economic activity is important for financial stability. In this context, the Committee will decisively continue to implement the strengthened macroprudential policy set by taking additional measures.
19.    The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of strengthened measures for sustainable price and financial stability along with the decline in inflation owing to the base effect and the resolution of the ongoing regional conflict. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged.
20.    To create an institutional basis for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy framework continues with the aim of encouraging permanent and strengthened liraization in all policy tools of the CBRT. The collateral and liquidity policy actions, of which the review process is finalized, will be implemented. The focus of this process will be on developing policy instruments to support the improvement of Turkish lira deposits, to increase Turkish lira-denominated assets in the collateral structure of OMO funding, to gradually reduce the volume of swaps, and to strengthen foreign exchange reserves.
21.    Accordingly, the effects of liquidity and distribution developments of the Turkish lira on deposits and loan pricing, the effects of exchange rate developments on inflation, and the impact of the developments regarding FX-protected deposit products on reverse currency substitution, the depth and stability of the foreign exchange market and price stability are being analyzed and necessary policy measures are being taken.
22.    The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively within the framework of the liraization strategy until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term target of 5 percent is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability.
23.    Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, the continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and of the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and a durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.
24.    The Committee supports building strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders in order to achieve price stability.
25.    The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework."

Press Release on Reserve Requirements and Maintenance of Turkish Lira-Denominated Securities for Foreign Currency Liabilities
On 26 May 2022, the Monetary Policy Committee had announced that the collateral and liquidity policy actions, of which the review process was finalized, would be implemented.
Accordingly, as a complementary step to the action increasing the weight of the Turkish lira fixed-rate securities in the collateral pool that will become effective on 24 June, banks will maintain additional Turkish lira long-term fixed-rate securities for foreign currency deposits/participation funds. The aim of this regulation is to increase the effectiveness of the monetary policy within the scope of the liraization strategy. The first maintenance period will start on 29 July.
With a view to supporting financial stability, the reserve requirement ratio for Turkish lira-denominated commercial cash loans, which was announced as 10% in the press release dated 23 April  2022, has been increased to 20%. The increase will be effective from the maintenance period starting on 8 July.

Press Release on Interest Rates
Participating Committee Members
Şahap Kavcıoğlu (Governor), Taha Çakmak, Mustafa Duman, Elif Haykır Hobikoğlu, Emrah Şener, Yusuf Tuna.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 14 percent.
The escalating geopolitical risks were adversely realized in the first half of the year and caused a weakening in the worldwide economic activity. Global growth forecasts for the upcoming period are being revised downwards. Increasing concern over global food security driven by trade restrictions, high course of commodity prices, the persistence of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly in food and energy, and high transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. Moreover, central banks in advanced economies emphasize that the rise in inflation may last longer than previously anticipated due to rising energy prices and imbalances between supply and demand. The divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies increased due to their diverse economic outlook. It is observed that central banks have increased their efforts to develop new supportive measures and tools to cope with the increasing uncertainties in financial markets.
Level of capacity utilization and other leading indicators show that robust growth in the beginning of the year continues in the second quarter as well, with the support of external demand. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases with tourism-related improvements, risks on current account balance due to energy prices continue. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability. Credit growth and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes are closely monitored. The Committee will continue to implement the strengthened macroprudential policy set decisively and take additional measures when needed.
Increase in inflation is driven by rising energy costs resulting from geopolitical developments, temporary effects of pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, strong negative supply shocks caused by the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices. The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken and decisively implemented for strengthening sustainable price and financial stability along with the decline in inflation owing to the base effect and the resolution of the ongoing regional conflict. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. To create an institutional basis for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy framework continues with the aim of encouraging permanent and strengthened liraization in all policy tools of the CBRT. The collateral and liquidity policy actions, of which the review process is finalized, will continue to be implemented to strengthen the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.
The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively within the framework of liraization strategy until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.

Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 23 June 2022
Inflation Developments 
1.    Consumer prices rose by 2.98% in May, while annual inflation increased by 3.53 points to 73.50%. Up across all subcategories, annual consumer inflation was mostly driven higher by core goods and services. Annual inflation increased in all subcategories of core goods. On the services front, annual inflation was relatively flat for transportation services, but went up in other subcategories, especially in restaurants-hotels. As for the food category, annual inflation declined in unprocessed food due to the partial correction in vegetable prices, but continued to rise in processed food. The outlook for energy inflation was largely dominated by changes in municipal water tariffs and fuel prices. Producer prices increased further due to international commodity prices, rising domestic energy prices and ongoing supply chain disruptions. Thus, annual inflation went up in B and C indices.
2.    Prices of food and nonalcoholic beverages increased by 1.63% in May, while annual inflation rose by 2.53 points to 91.63% in this category. Annual inflation fell by 3.06 points to 97.61% in unprocessed food but increased by 7.92 points to 86.01% in processed food. Across items of unprocessed food, seasonally adjusted prices of fresh fruits and vegetables recorded a decline due to the correction in vegetable prices. Across items excluding fresh fruits and vegetables, prices of red meat, white meat, milk, rice and dried nuts saw an increase, whereas egg prices dropped. Despite the decline in unprocessed food inflation, processed food inflation remained on the rise. In the bread and cereals item, where the effects of grain price developments were observed, annual inflation was realized at 90.69 percent, as prices increased by 3.65 percent. Monthly price hikes were more pronounced for processed food items excluding bread and cereal due to fats-oils, tea-coffee, meat products, sugar and related products, and especially cheese and other dairy products.
3.    Energy prices rose by 2.90 % in May, and annual energy inflation increased by 3.01 points to 121.21%. This was mostly driven by administered municipal water tariffs and fuel prices led by Turkish lira-denominated oil prices. In this period, solid fuel prices continued to increase, especially for coal, while bottled gas prices were slightly down relative to international butane and propane prices.
4.    Prices for services rose by 3.73% in May, and annual services inflation rose by 3.60 points to 45.78%. Annual inflation was relatively flat in transportation services, but was higher in other subcategories, with restaurants-hotels in the lead. Annual inflation increased by 7.57 points to 76.83% in restaurants-hotels, but remained flat at 78.16% in transportation services due to the base effect. Prices for the other services subcategory rose by 2.97% on the back of package tours dominated by pilgrimage tours that are about to resume, while seasonally adjusted data indicate that there has been some acceleration in monthly rent increases.
5.    The annual core goods inflation increased by 3.74 points to 65.32% in May. Annual inflation rose across all subgroups. Durable goods prices were up by 2.14% in May, led by furniture, automobile and white goods. Thus, annual inflation in durable consumption goods reached 76.75%. Monthly inflation in the other core goods group stood at 3.94%. While this was mainly driven by household-related cleaning materials, personal care products and housing maintenance and repair materials, price increases spread across the group. Clothing and footwear prices rose by 4.63% in May, driving annual inflation up by 3.52 points to 29.27%. 
6.    In May, alcoholic beverages and tobacco products increased by 6.53% and annual inflation rose to 66.62%. While this rise was determined by the price increases by producer firms, the contribution of this group to monthly consumer inflation stood at 0.28 points. 
7.    According to the June results of the Survey of Market Participants, the current year-end inflation expectation rose by 6.67 points to 64.59% and the 12-month-ahead inflation expectation increased by 4.63 points to 37.91%. The 24-month-ahead inflation expectation is 22.04%.
Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks
8.    The escalating geopolitical risks were adversely realized in the first half of the year and caused a weakening in the worldwide economic activity. Global growth forecasts for the upcoming period are being revised downwards.
9.    Increasing concern over global food security driven by trade restrictions, high course of commodity prices, the persistence of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly in food and energy, and high transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. Moreover, central banks in advanced economies emphasize that the rise in inflation may last longer than previously anticipated due to rising energy prices and imbalances between supply and demand. The divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies increased due to their diverse economic outlook. It is observed that central banks have increased their efforts to develop new supportive measures and tools to cope with the increasing uncertainties in financial markets.
10.    Regarding portfolio flows to emerging economies, bond and equity markets both continued to register outflows in June in tandem with the global risk appetite. However, the volatility in long-term bond rates in advanced economies and the course of global financial conditions keep the risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies alive. The impact of such risks through the portfolio flows channel towards Türkiye is expected to remain relatively limited, considering the current levels of non-residents’ portfolio positions.
11.    Increase in inflation is driven by rising energy costs resulting from geopolitical developments, temporary effects of pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, strong negative supply shocks caused by the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices.
12.    As a result of geopolitical developments, the high levels seen in commodity prices, primarily in energy and agricultural products, the ongoing disruptions in supply chains and increases in domestic energy costs continue to affect producer prices. Across main industrial categories, annual inflation was almost flat in intermediate goods, but was up in other subgroups, energy in particular. The energy producer prices increased by 27.65% month-on-month, driven by the rise in natural gas prices.
13.    Economic activity remained strong in the first quarter of 2022. In this period, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased by 7.3% year-on-year, and by 1.2% quarter-on-quarter in seasonally and calendar adjusted terms. On the production side, the main determinants of annual growth in the first quarter were services and the industry sectors, while the construction sector limited growth. On the expenditures side, the main driver of annual growth was the final domestic demand led by private consumption, while the contribution of net exports was 3.5 points. Machinery-equipment investments, a component of total investments, continued to grow on a yearly basis. As a matter of fact, as of the first quarter of the year, the share of machinery-equipment investments and net exports in GDP reached its highest level over the last decade.
14.    Level of capacity utilization and other leading indicators show that robust growth in the beginning of the year continues in the second quarter as well, with the support of external demand. Industrial production adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects remained flat in April compared to the previous month. Thus, production grew by 0.3% in April compared to the previous quarter. The industrial production of sectors with higher export shares posted a strong growth in this period. Industrial turnover indices also revealed that external demand continued to support industrial production. Meanwhile, retail sales volume indices were up in April compared to the previous quarter, indicating the ongoing recovery in domestic demand.
15.    Investment tendencies of manufacturing industry firms for the next twelve months remain high. Firms’ registered domestic and external orders and future order expectations reveal that external demand maintains its supportive course in the second quarter. On the other hand, card spending data confirm the recovery trend in domestic demand for the April-May period.
16.    Developments in the labor market are in tandem with the outlook of economic activity. In April, the seasonally-adjusted total employment rate rose by 1.4% (approximately 408 thousand people) month-on-month. As the labor participation rate increased by 0.7 percentage points, the seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate has remained almost flat since the previous month at 11.3%. Survey indicators and high-frequency data indicate that the upward trend in employment is maintained.
17.    The recent strong course of energy imports still affects the current account balance. In April 2022, the Current Account Balance (CAB) registered a deficit of USD 2.7 billion, while the annualized current account deficit rose by USD 1.2 billion to USD 25.7 billion. According to the provisional external trade data, exports remained strong in May, while imports remained high due to energy prices. On the other hand, it is observed that short-term regional losses caused by the conflict are compensated by the increase in exports to other countries thanks to the dynamic capacity and market diversification flexibility of exporting firms and regional exports exceeded pre-conflict levels. Despite the increase in the foreign trade deficit led by the surge in commodity, mainly energy, prices the ongoing upward trend in services revenues further supports the current account balance. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases with tourism-related improvements, risks on current account balance due to energy prices continue. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability. 
Monetary Policy
18.    The monetary policy stance will be determined by taking into account the evaluations on the source and permanence of risks, along with the extent to which they can be contained by monetary policy, and with a focus on achieving the sustainable price stability target, in a cautious manner.
19.    In formulating the monetary policy towards achieving the sustainable price stability objective, a liraization-oriented approach will be maintained that also addresses risks to financial stability. Credit growth and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes are closely monitored. The Committee will continue to implement the strengthened macroprudential policy set decisively and take additional measures when needed.
20.    The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken and decisively implemented for strengthening sustainable price and financial stability along with the decline in inflation owing to the base effect and the resolution of the ongoing regional conflict. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged.
21.    To create an institutional basis for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy framework continues with the aim of encouraging permanent and strengthened liraization in all policy tools of the CBRT. The focus of this process will be on developing policy instruments to support the improvement of Turkish lira deposits, to increase Turkish lira-denominated assets in the collateral structure of OMO funding, to gradually reduce the volume of swaps, and to strengthen foreign exchange reserves.
22.    The collateral and liquidity policy actions, of which the review process is finalized, will continue to be implemented to strengthen the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Following these actions, it is observed that interest rates of long-term fixed-income and TL-denominated securities converged to policy rates and yield curve shifted downward in all maturities, increasing the effectiveness of monetary policy. Similarly, the Committee considers that the improvement in financing costs of loans, which provide efficiency gains in targeted areas, is important for increasing the efficiency of the monetary transmission mechanism.
23.    Accordingly, the effects of liquidity and distribution developments of the Turkish lira on deposits and loan pricing, the effects of exchange rate developments on inflation, and the impact of the developments regarding FX-protected deposit products on reverse currency substitution, the depth and stability of the foreign exchange market and price stability are being analyzed and necessary policy measures are being taken.
24.    The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively within the framework of the liraization strategy until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. 
25.    Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.
26.    The Committee supports building strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders in order to achieve price stability.
27.    The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework."

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 14 percent.
The escalating geopolitical risks has continued to be adversely realized and caused further weakening in the worldwide economic activity. Global growth forecasts for the upcoming period are being revised downwards and the likelihood of a recession has increased. Increasing concern over global food security driven by trade restrictions, high and volatile course of commodity prices, and the persistence of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly in food, have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. Moreover, central banks in advanced economies emphasize that the rise in inflation may last longer than previously anticipated due to rising energy prices, imbalances between supply and demand, and rigidities in labor markets. The divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies continue due to their diverse economic outlook. It is observed that central banks have increased and diversified their efforts to develop new supportive measures and tools to cope with the increasing uncertainties in financial markets. 
Robust growth in the beginning of the year continued in the second quarter as well, with the support of external demand. Compared to peer economies, job creation has been stronger. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, the tourism-led improvement in current account balance continues with a solid pace.  On the other hand, high course of energy prices and the likelihood of a recession in main trade partners keep the risks on current account balance alive. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability. Despite losing momentum, credit growth, and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes are closely monitored. The Committee will continue to implement the strengthened macroprudential policy set decisively and take additional measures when needed. 
Increase in inflation is driven by rising energy costs resulting from geopolitical developments, effects of pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, strong negative supply shocks caused by the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices.

28 July 2022
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 21 July 2022
Inflation Developments 
1.    Consumer prices rose by 4.95% in June and annual inflation increased by 5.12 points to 78.62%. In this period, annual consumer inflation was up across all subcategories, mostly driven by energy (accounting for 3.65 points of the 5.12-point-rise). The rise in energy inflation was determined by fuel, natural gas and electricity items due to the outlook for Turkish lira-denominated international energy prices. Annual inflation was up in all subcategories in the services group. While annual food inflation declined in the unprocessed food group thanks to the ongoing correction in vegetable prices, it continued to increase in the processed food group. Annual inflation in core goods posted a decline across subcategories except for durable goods. The rise in producer prices persisted as a result of the increase in international and domestic energy prices, and ongoing supply chain disruptions. Against this background, while the seasonally-adjusted monthly changes of B and C indices slowed down, their annual inflation increased.
2.    Prices of food and nonalcoholic beverages increased by 2.09% in June, and the group’s annual inflation rose by 2.30 points to 93.93%. Annual inflation fell by 5.96 points to 91.65% in unprocessed food, but increased by 10.03 points to 96.04% in processed food. In unprocessed food, seasonally-adjusted prices of fresh fruits and vegetables recorded a decline due to the ongoing correction in vegetable prices. Across unprocessed food items excluding fresh fruits and vegetables, prices of rice, potato and dried nuts, in addition to milk, affected by the raw milk reference price adjustment, came to the forefront. Despite the decline in unprocessed food inflation, processed food inflation increased further. The monthly price increase in the processed food group was of 7.53%, mostly driven by cheese and other dairy products, bread and cereals, nonalcoholic beverages, tea, and products related to sugar.
3.    Energy prices rose by 16.16% in June, and annual energy inflation increased by 30.12 points to 151.33%. Price increases spread across the group, led by fuel and administered prices. Gaining momentum due to the TL-denominated international oil prices, fuel prices rose by 21.88%, and annual inflation in this subgroup reached 251.98%. Due to the developments in global energy prices, residential natural gas and electricity prices went up in this period by 25.11% and 15.01%, respectively.
4.    Prices of services rose by 3.98% in June, and annual services inflation stood at 48.69%. Annual inflation increased in all subcategories. International energy and agricultural commodity prices continued to affect services inflation. In the restaurants-hotels group, prices rose by 5.42%, and annual inflation hit 79.55%. Transport services recorded price increases of 4.57% due to intercity passenger transport tariffs via highway, railway as well as transport by air. Thus, annual inflation in the transport group reached 81.83%. Prices in the other services subcategory rose by 3.14%. Driven by internet and telephone call charges, communication services prices rose by 3.16%. Rents increased by 3.11% month-on-month, and the seasonally-adjusted data suggested an acceleration in monthly increases.
5.    Annual core goods inflation edged down by 0.46 points to 64.86% in June. In this period, annual inflation receded in clothing-footwear and other core goods groups, but rose in durable goods. Driven by furniture and automobile items, the monthly price increase in durable goods became 3.65%, and the group’s annual inflation hit 77.90%. On the other core goods front, annual inflation fell by 0.94 points to 70.64%. Monthly price increases in the clothing and footwear group remained flat, while annual inflation declined by 2.92 points to 26.35%.
6.    Alcoholic beverages and tobacco products increased by 2.61% and annual inflation reached 70.99% in June, due also to raised taxes in prices of alcoholic beverages. The contribution of this group to monthly consumer inflation stood at 0.12 points.
7.    According to the July results of the Survey of Market Participants, the current year-end inflation expectation rose by 5.35 points to 69.94% and the 12-month-ahead inflation expectation increased by 2.32 points to 40.23%. The 24-month-ahead inflation expectation is 24.27%.
Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks
8.    The escalating geopolitical risks have continued to have negative impacts and caused further weakening in the worldwide economic activity. Global growth forecasts for the upcoming period are being revised downwards and the likelihood of a recession has increased.
9.    Increasing concern over global food security driven by trade restrictions, high and volatile course of commodity prices, and the persistence of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly in food, have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. Moreover, central banks in advanced economies emphasize that the rise in inflation may last longer than previously anticipated due to rising energy prices, imbalances between supply and demand, and rigidities in labor markets. The divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies continues due to their diverse economic outlook. It is observed that central banks have increased and diversified their efforts to develop new supportive measures and tools to cope with the increasing uncertainties in financial markets.
10.    The strengthening US dollar on a global scale due to rising financial uncertainties exerts pressure on the currencies of other countries. While the currencies of emerging economies depreciated significantly against the US dollar in July, the Turkish lira diverged relatively in a positive manner. Due to the impact of the policy steps taken within the scope of the liraization strategy, Türkiye's Turkish lira-denominated government bond yields, especially in long maturities, performed more favorably in this period compared to peer economies.
11.    Regarding portfolio flows to emerging economies, bond and equity markets have both continued to register outflows in July in line with the global risk appetite. Moreover, the volatility in the long-term bond yields in advanced economies and the course of global financial conditions keep the risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies alive.
12.    Increase in inflation is driven by rising energy costs resulting from geopolitical developments, effects of pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, strong negative supply shocks caused by the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices.
13.    Amid geopolitical tensions, rising international and domestic energy prices and ongoing supply chain disruptions continue to affect producer prices. Across main industrial groupings, annual inflation was up in all sub-groups, with energy inflation in the lead.
14.    Robust growth in the beginning of the year continued in the second quarter as well, with the support of external demand. Adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects, industrial production increased by 0.5% month-on-month and by 13.3% year-on-year in May. Thus, production grew by 0.5% as of May compared to the previous quarter. The quarterly increase in industrial production of sectors with higher export shares was stronger than that of other sectors. Industrial turnover indices also showed that external demand continued to support industrial production. Retail sales volume indices, on the other hand, rose by 4% quarter-on-quarter as of May, pointing to continued recovery in domestic demand.
15.    Investment tendencies of manufacturing industry firms for the next twelve months remain high. Firms’ registered domestic and external orders and future order expectations reveal that external demand maintains its supportive course in the second quarter. On the other hand, while continuing to rise throughout the second quarter, card spending indicated a slowdown in domestic demand towards the end of the quarter.
16.    Developments in the labor market display a strong outlook in tandem with the outlook of economic activity. Job creation in the post-pandemic recovery period have been more pronounced, especially in industrial and services sectors, compared to peer economies. In fact, seasonally-adjusted total employment grew by 1.2% (approximately by 358 thousand people) month-on-month in May. The 0.4-point increase in labor force participation curbed the decline in seasonally-adjusted unemployment. Thus, unemployment fell by 0.3 points from the previous month to 10.9%. In addition, survey indicators and high-frequency data indicate that the upward trend in employment is maintained, albeit at a slightly slower pace.
17.    The recent strong course of energy imports still affects the current account balance. In May 2022, the Current Account Balance (CAB) registered a deficit of USD 6.5 billion, while the annualized current account deficit rose by USD 3.2 billion to USD 29.4 billion. The fact that anticipated exports were brought forward due to the Ramadan Feast in the first week of the month was influential in high current account deficit in May. According to the provisional external trade data, in June, exports remained strong while imports continued to increase despite the partial decline in energy imports. Meanwhile, it is observed that short-term regional losses caused by the conflict are compensated by the increase in exports to other countries thanks to the dynamic capacity and market diversification flexibility of exporting firms. Despite the increase in the foreign trade deficit led by the surge in commodity, mainly energy prices, the ongoing upward trend in services revenues further supports the current account balance. While the share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, the tourism-led improvement in current account balance continues with a solid pace.  On the other hand, high course of energy prices and the likelihood of a recession in main trade partners keep the risks on the current account balance alive. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability.
Monetary Policy
18.    The monetary policy stance will be determined by taking into account the evaluations on the source and permanence of risks, along with the extent to which they can be contained by monetary policy, and with a focus on achieving the sustainable price stability target, in a cautious manner.
19.    In formulating the monetary policy towards achieving the sustainable price stability objective, a liraization-oriented approach will be maintained that also addresses risks to financial stability. Despite losing its momentum, credit growth, and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes are closely monitored. The Committee will continue to implement the strengthened macroprudential policy set decisively and take additional measures when needed.
20.    The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken and decisively implemented for strengthening sustainable price and financial stability along with the resolution of the ongoing regional conflict. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged.
21.    To create an institutional basis for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy framework continues with the aim of encouraging permanent and strengthened liraization in all policy tools of the CBRT. The focus of this process will be on developing policy instruments to support the improvement of Turkish lira deposits, to increase Turkish lira-denominated assets in the collateral structure of OMO funding, to gradually reduce the volume of swaps, and to strengthen foreign exchange reserves.
22.    The credit, collateral and liquidity policy actions, of which the review process is finalized, will continue to be implemented to strengthen the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. The rise in the demand for long-term fixed-income and Turkish lira-denominated assets and the course of the yield in tandem with the direction of the efficiency of monetary transmission is closely monitored. Along with credit growth, the Committee will also consider the improvement in financing costs of loans providing efficiency gains in targeted areas so as to maintain the transmission.
23.    Accordingly, the effects of liquidity and distribution developments of the Turkish lira on deposits and loan pricing, the effects of exchange rate developments on inflation, and the impact of the developments regarding FX-protected deposit products on reverse currency substitution, the depth and stability of the foreign exchange market and price stability are being analyzed and necessary policy measures are being taken.
24.    The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively within the framework of the liraization strategy until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability.
25.    Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.
26.    The Committee supports building strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders in order to achieve price stability.

Participating Committee Members
 Şahap Kavcıoğlu (Governor), Taha Çakmak, Mustafa Duman, Elif Haykır Hobikoğlu, Emrah Şener, Yusuf Tuna.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 14 percent to 13 percent.
The weakening effects of geopolitical risks on global economic activity continue to increase. Global growth forecasts for the upcoming period are being revised downwards and recession is increasingly assessed as an inevitable risk factor. While the negative consequences of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly basic food, have been alleviated by the strategic solutions facilitated by Türkiye, the upward trend in producer and consumer prices continues on an international scale. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. Moreover, central banks in advanced economies emphasize that the rise in inflation may last longer than previously anticipated due to rising energy prices, imbalances between supply and demand, and rigidities in labor markets. The divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies continue due to their diverse economic outlook. It is observed that central banks continue their efforts to develop new supportive measures and tools to cope with the increasing uncertainties in financial markets.
Robust growth in the beginning of the year continued in the second quarter as well, with the support of external demand. Compared to peer economies, job creation has been stronger. Considering the sectors that contribute to the employment increase, it is observed that the growth dynamics are supported by structural gains. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, the stronger than expected contribution of tourism revenues to the current account balance continues. On the other hand, high course of energy prices and the likelihood of a recession in main trade partners keep the risks on current account balance alive. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability. The rate of credit growth and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes are closely monitored. In addition, the recent increase in spread between policy rate and the loan interest rate is considered to reduce the effectiveness of monetary transmission. In this context, the Committee decided to further strengthen the macroprudential policy set with tools supporting the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism.
Increase in inflation is driven by the lagged and indirect effects of rising energy costs resulting from geopolitical developments, effects of pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, strong negative supply shocks caused by the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices. The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken and decisively implemented for strengthening sustainable price and financial stability along with the resolution of the ongoing regional conflict. Additionally, leading indicators for the third quarter point to some loss of momentum in economic activity. It is important that financial conditions remain supportive to preserve the growth momentum in industrial production and the positive trend in employment in a period of increasing uncertainties regarding global growth as well as escalating geopolitical risk. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to reduce the policy rate by 100 basis points, and has assessed that the updated level of policy rate is adequate under the current outlook. To create an institutional basis for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy framework continues with the aim of encouraging permanent and strengthened liraization in all policy tools of the CBRT. The credit, collateral and liquidity policy actions, of which the review process is finalized, will continue to be implemented to strengthen the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.
The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively within the framework of liraization strategy until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.
The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

Press Release on Macroprudential Measures
Reserve requirement and liquidity requirement practices involving the appropriate on and off-balance sheet items of banks and other financial institutions are among the fundamental duties and powers of the Central Bank as laid down by Article 4 of the Law No. 1211 on the Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye.
In order to support financial stability and strengthen the monetary transmission mechanism, the Central Bank has been strengthening its macroprudential toolkit with reserve requirement and Turkish lira denominated securities maintenance practices, involving both asset and liability items.
In its press release of 26 May 2022, the CBRT announced that it would implement collateral and liquidity policy actions, the review process of which is finalized. Accordingly, pursuant to the Communique No. 2022/20 of 10 June 2022, banks started to maintain Turkish lira-denominated securities for foreign currency deposits/participation funds. Within the scope of this regulation, banks maintain securities at ratios set according to their targets of conversion to Turkish lira deposit/participation accounts. The first maintenance period started on 29 July 2022.
In its press release of 18 August 2022, the Monetary Policy Committee announced that the rate of credit growth and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes were closely monitored and the recent increase in spread between policy rate and the loan interest rate was considered to reduce the effectiveness of monetary transmission. In this context, the Committee announced that the macroprudential policy set would be further strengthened, and the credit, collateral and liquidity policy actions, of which the review process is finalized, would continue to be implemented to support the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism.
As a result of the evaluations, the CBRT has made the following decisions for  loans subject to the reserve requirement practice the Bank stated in its press release of 23 April 2022:
a) The reserve requirement maintenance being applied at a ratio of 20% will be replaced by maintenance of securities at 30% for banks to enhance the efficiency of the practice,
b) Securities equaling the loan amount exceeding the loan growth rate of 10% as of 30 December 2022 compared to 29 July 2022 will be maintained for a period of one year,
c) In case the types of loans that are excluded are not extended against expenditure, such loans will be subject to the securities maintenance practice.
Additionally the CBRT has decided that:
d) For commercial loans to be extended from the publication date of the Communique until the end of 2022, securities will be maintained based on:

20% of the loan amount to be extended at an annual compound interest rate 1.4 times higher than the CBRT-released annual compound reference rate, and
90% of the loan amount to be extended at an annual compound interest rate 1.8 times higher than the CBRT-released annual compound reference rate. 

Technical details regarding the decisions above will be given in the relevant regulations.

2022,25 August 2022,Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting,"No: 2022-37
25 August 2022
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting 
Meeting Date: 18 August 2022
Inflation Developments 
1.    Consumer prices rose by 2.37% in July and annual inflation increased by 0.98 points to 79.60%. In this period, annual consumer inflation decreased in energy whereas it went up in other groups, with core goods and services having a significant impact on the rise in inflation. Annual inflation increased across the core goods group, while in the services group it rose in all subgroups other than restaurants-hotels. In the food group, annual inflation slightly declined in unprocessed food whereas it remained on the rise in processed food. Energy inflation registered a decline on the back of fuel and bottled gas prices that decreased in line with the developments in international energy prices. Despite the decline in prices of refined petroleum products and base metals driven by international commodity prices, producer inflation remained elevated due to other energy items in particular. Against this background, the rise in the annual inflation of core indicators continued.
2.    Prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 3.15% in July, and the group's annual inflation rose by 0.72 points to 94.65%. While annual inflation edged down by 0.65 points to 91.00% in unprocessed food, it increased by 1.98 points to 98.02% in processed food. Seasonally-adjusted prices of fresh fruits and vegetables, which had registered a decline in the last two months, rose in this period. Across unprocessed food items excluding fresh fruits and vegetables, the price increases in rice, eggs, potatoes and pulses were notable. The 3.61% rise in processed food prices was driven by bread-cereals, coffee-tea-cocoa, and non-alcoholic beverages.
3.    Energy prices receded by 3.13% in July, and the group’s annual inflation fell by 22.06 points to 129.27%. This was led by the 8.18% decline in fuel prices following the decrease in international crude oil prices, and annual inflation in this subgroup dropped by 37.11 points to 214.87%. In response to positive international developments, bottled gas prices also decreased by 3.98%. On the other hand, municipal water and solid fuel prices continued to increase. The decline in fuel prices is expected to affect energy prices favorably in August as well.
4.    Prices of services rose by 3.20% in July, pushing annual services inflation up by 2.76 points to 51.45%. In this period, annual inflation edged down in restaurants-hotels, but increased in other subcategories, more markedly in transport and rent. Prices in transport services increased by 5.01% on the back of intercity passenger transport by rail and road, air transport and urban passenger transport by bus. Thus, annual inflation in transport services rose to 90.71%. Price increases in restaurants-hotels lost pace in July with 2.49%, and annual inflation came in at 79.14% in this subcategory. In this period, internet fees stood out in communication services, while price increases were broad-based across other services. The 4.24% increase signaled an acceleration in monthly rent inflation.
5.    Prices of core goods rose by 3.67% in July, pushing annual core goods inflation up by 6.07 points to 70.93%. Prices of durable goods rose by 3.85% due to prices of white goods and automobiles, and annual inflation hit 84.93% in this subcategory. Prices of other core goods rose by 4.47% month-on-month, with medicines, household cleaning supplies and personal care products in the lead. Prices of clothing and footwear increased by 1.74%, contrary to seasonal norms, and annual inflation rose by 5.10 points to 31.45% in this subcategory.
6.    Prices of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products increased by 6.85% in July, pushing annual inflation up to 82.66% in this group. This upsurge was attributed to the limited impact of the tax adjustment in cigarette prices as well as the price increments by producer companies.
7.    According to the August results of the Survey of Market Participants, current year-end inflation expectations increased by 0.66 points to 70.60%, while 12-month ahead inflation expectations were revised upwards by 1.76 points to 41.99%. 24-month ahead inflation expectations remained almost flat at 24.35%.
Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks
8.    The weakening effects of geopolitical risks on global economic activity continue to increase. Global growth forecasts for the upcoming period are being revised downwards and recession is increasingly assessed as an inevitable risk factor. 
9.    While the negative consequences of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly basic food, have been alleviated by the strategic solutions facilitated by Türkiye, the upward trend in producer and consumer prices continues on an international scale. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. Moreover, central banks in advanced economies emphasize that the rise in inflation may last longer than previously anticipated due to rising energy prices, imbalances between supply and demand, and rigidities in labor markets. The divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies continue due to their diverse economic outlook. It is observed that central banks continue their efforts to develop new supportive measures and tools to cope with the increasing uncertainties in financial markets.
10.    Regarding portfolio flows to emerging economies, bond and equity markets have both continued to register outflows in August in line with the global risk appetite. Moreover, the volatility in the long-term bond yields in advanced economies and the course of global financial conditions keep the risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies alive. In Türkiye, there has been a significant increase in interest from foreign investors in capital markets investment instruments in recent weeks. 
11.    Due to the impact of the policy steps taken within the scope of the liraization strategy, Türkiye's Turkish lira-denominated government bond yields, especially in long maturities, performed more favorably in this period compared to peer economies.
12.    Increase in inflation is driven by the lagged and indirect effects of rising energy costs resulting from geopolitical developments, effects of pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, strong negative supply shocks caused by the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices. 
13.    Although the effects of falling international commodity prices have been visible in producer prices through refined petroleum products and base metal items, prices increased further across sub-groups in July, most notably in electricity, natural gas, basic pharmaceutical products and tobacco products.
14.    Robust growth in the beginning of the year continued in the second quarter as well, with the support of external demand. Adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects, industrial production grew by 1.3% month-on-month and by 8.4% year-on-year in June. Thus, industrial production increased by 1.1% compared to the previous quarter. In sectors with relatively high export shares, industrial production growth was stronger on monthly and quarterly basis. Although the retail sales volume index decreased by 0.7% month-on-month, it surged by 4.2% in the second quarter compared to the previous one. In this context, in line with the data on card spending, domestic demand implies a recovery in the second quarter.
15.    Developments in the labor market display a strong outlook in tandem with the outlook of economic activity in the second quarter. Job creation in the post-pandemic recovery period has been more pronounced, especially in industrial and services sectors compared to peer economies. In fact, seasonally-adjusted total employment grew by 2.5% (approximately by 765 thousand people) in the second quarter. Considering the sectors that contribute to the employment increase, chiefly the industrial sector with a quarterly increase by 3.3%, it is observed that the growth dynamics are supported by structural gains. As a result, unemployment fell by 0.4 points from the previous month to 10.6%. Meanwhile, survey indicators and high-frequency data indicate that the upward trend in employment is maintained, albeit at a slower pace.
16.    Leading indicators for the third quarter point to some loss of momentum in economic activity. Survey-based indicators such as the Business Tendency Survey, PMI and sectoral confidence indices as well as other high-frequency data hint at a slowdown in economic activity as of mid-August. Registered domestic and external orders and future order expectations of manufacturing industry firms also point to a weakening in domestic and foreign demand. Firms' investment and employment expectations, although being high, declined as of July. Information obtained from field interviews also gave similar signals regarding the economic activity in this period.
17.    The recent strong course of energy imports still affects the current account balance. In June 2022, the Current Account Balance registered a deficit of USD 3.5 billion, while the annualized current account deficit rose by USD 2.3 billion to USD 32.7 billion. The provisional external trade data implies a limited slowdown in exports in July due to the religious holiday and following days-off as well as partial suspension of production in the automotive sector. Meanwhile, thanks to the dynamic capacity and market diversification flexibility of exporting companies, exports remained strong despite geopolitical risks. As for imports, although there has been a partial decline, the high level of energy imports and increasing gold imports limited this decline. Despite the increase in the foreign trade deficit led by the surge in commodity prices, mainly energy prices, the ongoing uptrend in services revenues continue to support the current account balance. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, the stronger than expected contribution of tourism revenues to the current account balance continues.  On the other hand, high course of energy prices and the likelihood of a recession in main trade partners keep the risks on the current account balance alive. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability.
Monetary Policy 
18.    The monetary policy stance will be determined by taking into account the evaluations on the source and permanence of risks, along with the extent to which they can be contained by monetary policy, and with a focus on achieving the sustainable price stability target, in a cautious manner.
19.    In formulating the monetary policy towards achieving the sustainable price stability objective, a liraization-oriented approach will be maintained that also addresses risks to financial stability. The rate of credit growth and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes are closely monitored. In addition, the recent increase in spread between policy rate and the loan interest rate is considered to reduce the effectiveness of monetary transmission. In this context, the Committee decided to further strengthen the macroprudential policy set with tools supporting the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism.
20.    The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken and decisively implemented for strengthening sustainable price and financial stability along with the resolution of the ongoing regional conflict. It is important that financial conditions remain supportive to preserve the growth momentum in industrial production and the positive trend in employment in a period of increasing uncertainties regarding global growth as well as escalating geopolitical risk. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to reduce the policy rate by 100 basis points, and has assessed that the updated level of policy rate is adequate under the current outlook.
21.    To create an institutional basis for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy framework continues with the aim of encouraging permanent and strengthened liraization in all policy tools of the CBRT. The focus of this process will be on developing policy instruments to support the improvement of Turkish lira deposits, to increase Turkish lira-denominated assets in the collateral structure of OMO funding, to gradually reduce the volume of swaps, and to strengthen foreign exchange reserves.
22.    The credit, collateral and liquidity policy actions, of which the review process is finalized, will continue to be implemented to strengthen the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. The rise in the demand for long-term fixed-income and Turkish lira-denominated assets and the course of the yield in tandem with the direction of the efficiency of monetary transmission is closely monitored. Along with credit growth, the Committee will also consider the improvement in financing costs of loans providing efficiency gains in targeted areas so as to maintain the transmission.
23.    Accordingly, the effects of liquidity and distribution developments of the Turkish lira on deposits and loan pricing, the effects of exchange rate developments on inflation, and the impact of the developments regarding FX-protected deposit products on reverse currency substitution, the depth and stability of the foreign exchange market and price stability are being analyzed and necessary policy measures are being taken.
24.    The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively within the framework of the liraization strategy until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability.
25.    Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.
26.    The Committee supports building strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders in order to achieve price stability.
27.    The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework."

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 13 percent to 12 percent.
The weakening effects of geopolitical risks on global economic activity continue to increase. Global growth forecasts for the upcoming period are being revised downwards and recession is increasingly assessed as an inevitable risk factor. While the negative consequences of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly basic food, have been alleviated by the strategic solutions facilitated by Türkiye, the upward trend in producer and consumer prices continues on an international scale. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. Moreover, central banks in advanced economies emphasize that the rise in inflation may last longer than previously anticipated due to rising energy prices, imbalances between supply and demand, and rigidities in labor markets. The divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies continue due to their diverse economic outlook. It is observed that central banks continue their efforts to develop new supportive measures and tools to cope with the increasing uncertainties in financial markets.
A strong growth was observed in the first half of 2022. Since the beginning of July, leading indicators have been pointing to a slowdown in growth due to the weakening foreign demand. Compared to peer economies, job creation has been stronger. Considering the sectors that contribute to the employment increase, it is observed that the growth dynamics are supported by structural gains. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, the stronger than expected contribution of tourism revenues to the current account balance continues. On the other hand, high course of energy prices and the likelihood of a recession in main trade partners keep the risks on current account balance alive. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability. The rate of credit growth and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes are closely monitored. In addition, the spread between policy rate and the loan interest rates driven by the announced macroprudential measures is closely monitored. The Committee will continue to further strengthen the tools supporting the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism.
Increase in inflation is driven by the lagged and indirect effects of rising energy costs resulting from geopolitical developments, effects of pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, strong negative supply shocks caused by the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices. The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken and decisively implemented for strengthening sustainable price and financial stability along with the resolution of the ongoing regional conflict.

29 September 2022
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting 
Meeting Date: 22 September 2022
Inflation Developments 
1.    Consumer prices rose by 1.46% in August, and annual inflation edged up by 0.61 points to 80.21%. In this period, annual inflation receded in energy and food, whereas it went up in core goods and services. Annual inflation increased in subgroups of core goods; in services, while dropped in transport, it rose in other subgroups of services. In the food group, driven by prices of fresh fruits and vegetables, annual inflation fell in unprocessed food, but increased further in processed food. Energy inflation registered a decline on the back of fuel prices that fell in tandem with the outlook for international crude oil prices. In line with the fall in international commodity prices, the monthly increase in producer prices lost pace compared to past months, and annual inflation decreased somewhat. Against this background, the rise in the annual inflation of B and C indices continued, while some core indicators such as seasonally-adjusted median inflation posted a limited decline.
2.    Prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 0.85% in August, while the group’s annual inflation dropped by 4.40 points to 90.25%. While annual inflation fell by 11.49 points to 79.51% in unprocessed food, it increased by 2.36 points to 100.38% in processed food. Seasonally-adjusted prices of fresh fruits and vegetables recorded a decline in August. In other unprocessed food, price hikes in eggs and rice were notable, while white meat and potatoes registered falling prices. Meanwhile, the rise in processed food prices was driven by bread-cereals accompanied by sugar and related products as well as canned vegetables and non-alcoholic beverages.
3.    Energy prices receded by 2.68% in August, and the group’s annual inflation fell by 7.54 points to 121.73%. The decline of 7.79% in fuel prices following the fall in international crude oil prices was the main driver of energy prices also in August. On the other hand, municipal water and solid fuel prices continued to increase. 
4.    Prices of services rose by 3.16% in August, pushing annual services inflation up by 2.85 points to 54.30%. In this period, while annual inflation receded slightly in the transport group due to the developments in fuel prices, it increased in other subgroups, most visibly in other services and rents. Price increases were broad-based in the other services subgroup. Education, due to the raised university tuitions, health, recreation-culture and insurance services driven by car insurance items stood out. The monthly increase in the rents group remained high at 4.40%, and seasonally-adjusted data suggested an acceleration compared to previous months. In the restaurants-hotels group, price increase was higher compared to the previous month, yet remained below those in the first half of the year. In August, annual inflation in this subgroup edged up by 1.81 points and reached 80.95%. In transport services, increases in urban passenger transport, air passenger transport and cargo fees were notable, while the decline in intercity passenger transport by road kept subgroup’s price increase moderate, and annual inflation edged down by 0.42 points to 90.29%.
5.    Annual core goods inflation rose by 5.98% points to 76.91% in August. Price hikes in durable goods were driven by automobiles and white goods, and annual inflation in this group rose by 6.86 points and hit 91.79%. Parallel to July, prices of clothing and footwear registered increases contrary to seasonal norms, and annual inflation rose by 5.93 points to 37.38% in this subgroup. In other core goods, annual inflation increased by 4.41% to 80.12%, with household cleaning supplies, medicines and personal care products in the lead. 
6.    According to the September results of the Survey of Market Participants, current year-end inflation expectations decreased by 2.87 points to 67.73%, while 12-month ahead inflation expectations were revised downwards by 5.25 points to 36.74%. Meanwhile, 24-month ahead inflation expectations dropped by 3.72 points to 20.63%.
Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks
7.    The weakening effects of geopolitical risks on global economic activity continue to increase. Global growth forecasts for the upcoming period are being revised downwards and recession is increasingly assessed as an inevitable risk factor.
8.    While the negative consequences of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly basic food, have been alleviated by the strategic solutions facilitated by Türkiye, the upward trend in producer and consumer prices continues on an international scale. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. Moreover, central banks in advanced economies emphasize that the rise in inflation may last longer than previously anticipated due to rising energy prices, imbalances between supply and demand, and rigidities in labor markets. The divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies continue due to their diverse economic outlook. It is observed that central banks continue their efforts to develop new supportive measures and tools to cope with the increasing uncertainties in financial markets.
9.    Regarding portfolio flows to emerging economies, bond and equity markets have both continued to register outflows in September in line with the global risk appetite. Moreover, the volatility in the long-term bond yields in advanced economies and the course of global financial conditions keep the risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies alive. 
10.    Due to the impact of the policy steps taken within the scope of the liraization strategy, Türkiye's Turkish lira-denominated government bond yields, especially in long maturities, performed more favorably in this period compared to peer economies.
11.    Increase in inflation is driven by the lagged and indirect effects of rising energy costs resulting from geopolitical developments, effects of pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, strong negative supply shocks caused by the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices.
12.    Annual producer inflation decreased in August. It is evaluated that the moderate course of international commodity prices and the declines in transport expenses have alleviated cost pressures to some extent. Having surged due to geopolitical problems, natural gas prices continued to be the main factor deteriorating this outlook in August. Across main industrial groupings, annual inflation declined in the energy group led by petroleum products, but increased in other subgroups in August. While price increases became widespread across subgroups, tobacco products, other mining and quarrying products, basic pharmaceuticals and paper and paper products stood out. Meanwhile, the effect of the positive outlook for international commodity prices was more pronounced in refined petroleum products and base metals, and prices fell further in these subgroups.
13.    A strong growth was observed in the first half of 2022. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data for the second quarter of 2022 indicated that economic activity maintained its strong course in the first quarter. In this period, GDP increased by 7.6% year-on-year, and by 2.1% quarter-on-quarter in seasonal and calendar-adjusted terms. Industrial value added increased by 7.8% on an annual basis thanks to the strong course of exports. The value added of the services sectors increased by 11.9% on the back of the strong tourism activity despite the war. The contribution of net exports to annual growth was 2.7 points. Machinery-equipment investments, one of the subitems of investments, went up by 17.8% on an annual basis, showing an annual increase for eleven quarters in a row. 
14.    Since the beginning of July, leading indicators have been pointing to a slowdown in growth due to the weakening foreign demand. While industrial production decreased by 6.2% month-on-month in seasonally and calendar adjusted terms, it increased by 3.1% year-on-year in July. After increasing by 1.9% and 0.9% in the first two quarters of the year, industrial production contracted by 5.1% in the third quarter due to the bridge days associated with the religious holidays and partial suspension of production in factories in July. While, the month-on-month decline in industrial production spread across sectors in July, clothing, textiles, basic metals and other transportation sectors posted higher monthly production losses of 8.6%, 10%, 9.3% and 19.4%, respectively. Although the retail sales volume index decreased slightly in July compared to the previous month, credit card spending continued to increase in the July-August period compared to the previous quarter.
15.    Leading indicators for the third quarter continue pointing to loss of momentum in economic activity due to the decreasing foreign demand. Survey-based indicators such as Business Tendency Survey, PMI and sectoral confidence indices as well as other high-frequency data point to a quarterly slowdown in economic activity as of mid-September. Registered domestic and external orders and future order expectations of manufacturing industry firms reveals a weakening in total demand, which is more pronounced for external demand. Firms' investment and employment expectations declined compared to the second quarter. Information obtained from field interviews also gave similar signals regarding the economic activity in this period.
16.    In July, employment was about 3 million higher than its pre-pandemic level (February 2020). In fact, compared to peer economies, job creation has been stronger. Considering the sectors that contribute to the employment increase, it is observed that the growth dynamics are supported by structural gains. On the other hand, on a monthly basis compared to the previous month, seasonally adjusted employment decreased by 148,000 persons leading 0.5% decrease in July. In this period, seasonally adjusted labor force participation rate decreased from 53.1% in the previous month by 0.5 points to 52.6% and is still 1.7 percentage points above its pre-pandemic level (February 2020). In July, on the unemployment rate, the downward effect of the decline in labor force participation exceeded the upward effect of the decline in employment. Thus, the unemployment rate declined and dropped by 0.3 points from the previous month to 10.1%. Survey indicators and high-frequency data indicate that the upward trend in employment has lost momentum.
17.    The recent strong course of energy and gold imports still affects the current account balance. The current account balance posted a deficit of USD 4.0 billion in July 2022, while the annualized current account deficit increased by USD 3.7 billion to USD 36.6 billion.  When the provisional foreign trade data for August is evaluated together with the high frequency data for September, it is observed that uptrend in the first half of the year in seasonally adjusted exports is replaced by a limited decline in the third quarter. Imports, on the other hand, strengthened on the back of high imports of energy and gold. Despite the increase in the foreign trade deficit led by the surge in commodity prices, mainly energy prices, the ongoing uptrend in services revenues continue to support the current account balance. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, the stronger than expected contribution of tourism revenues to the current account balance continues thanks to the increase in per capita tourist spending. On the other hand, high course of energy prices and the likelihood of a recession in main trade partners keep the risks on current account balance alive. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability.

18.    The monetary policy stance will be determined by taking into account the evaluations on the source and permanence of risks, along with the extent to which they can be contained by monetary policy, and with a focus on achieving the sustainable price stability target, in a cautious manner.
19.    In formulating the monetary policy towards achieving the sustainable price stability objective, a liraization-oriented approach will be maintained that also addresses risks to financial stability. The rate of credit growth and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes are closely monitored. In addition, the spread between policy rate and the loan interest rates driven by the announced macroprudential measures is closely monitored. The Committee will continue to further strengthen the tools supporting the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism.
20.    The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken and decisively implemented for strengthening sustainable price and financial stability along with the resolution of the ongoing regional conflict. It is important that financial conditions remain supportive to preserve the growth momentum in industrial production and the positive trend in employment in a period of increasing uncertainties regarding global growth as well as escalating geopolitical risks. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to reduce the policy rate by 100 basis points, and has assessed that the updated level of policy rate is adequate under the current outlook.
21.    To create an institutional basis for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy framework continues with the aim of encouraging permanent and strengthened liraization in all policy tools of the CBRT. The focus of this process will be on developing policy instruments to support the improvement of Turkish lira deposits, to increase Turkish lira-denominated assets in the collateral structure of OMO funding, to gradually reduce the volume of swaps, and to strengthen foreign exchange reserves.
22.    The credit, collateral and liquidity policy actions, of which the review process is finalized, will continue to be implemented to strengthen the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. The rise in the demand for long-term fixed-income and Turkish lira-denominated assets and the course of the yield in tandem with the direction of the efficiency of monetary transmission is closely monitored. Along with credit growth, the Committee will also consider the improvement in financing costs of loans providing efficiency gains in targeted areas so as to maintain the transmission.
23.    Accordingly, the effects of liquidity and distribution developments of the Turkish lira on deposits and loan pricing, the effects of exchange rate developments on inflation, and the impact of the developments regarding FX-protected deposit products on reverse currency substitution, the depth and stability of the foreign exchange market, and price stability are being analyzed, and necessary policy measures are being taken.
24.    The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively within the framework of the liraization strategy until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability.
25.    Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.
26.    The Committee supports building strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders in order to achieve price stability.
27.    The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework."

Press Release on Securities Maintenance
The Central Bank started to promote the conversion from foreign currency deposits to Turkish lira deposits in the scope of the “liraization strategy” in December 2021 and thus, took an important step towards reinforcing the preference for Turkish lira deposits. As a result of this practice, the share of Turkish lira in the balance sheets of banks has increased while their funding maturities have extended. Accordingly, the practice has strengthened banks’ balance sheets, thereby supporting financial stability. 
In the meantime, banks have realized their conversion targets set by the Central Bank at the end of 2021, and complied with the Turkish Lira-Denominated Securities Maintenance practice initiated as part of the “liraization strategy”. 
With the amendment made in the Securities Maintenance practice, the securities maintenance ratio is revised as 5%. By the beginning of 2023 securities will be maintained based on the targets of the Turkish lira deposits share, instead of the conversion rate. 
Further steps as part of the “liraization strategy” will be taken in the rest of the year and in 2023.

Participating Committee Members
Şahap Kavcıoğlu (Governor), Taha Çakmak, Mustafa Duman, Elif Haykır Hobikoğlu, Emrah Şener.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 12 percent to 10.5 percent.
The weakening effects of geopolitical risks on global economic activity continue to increase. Global growth forecasts for the upcoming period are being revised downwards and recession is increasingly assessed as an inevitable risk factor. While the negative consequences of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly basic food, have been alleviated by the strategic solutions facilitated by Türkiye, the upward trend in producer and consumer prices continues on an international scale. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. Moreover, central banks in advanced economies emphasize that the rise in inflation may last longer than previously anticipated due to rising energy prices, imbalances between supply and demand, and rigidities in labor markets. The divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies continue to increase due to their diverse economic outlook. It is observed that central banks continue their efforts to develop new supportive measures and tools to cope with the increasing uncertainties in financial markets.
A strong growth was observed in the first half of 2022. Leading indicators for the second half of the year continue pointing to a slowdown in growth due to the weakening foreign demand. Pressures on the manufacturing industry due to foreign demand and their currently limited impact on domestic demand and supply capacity are being monitored closely. Compared to peer economies, job creation has been stronger. Considering the sectors that contribute to the employment increase, it is observed that the growth dynamics are supported by structural gains. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, the stronger than expected contribution of tourism revenues to the current account balance continues. On the other hand, high course of energy prices and the likelihood of a recession in main trade partners keep the risks on current account balance alive. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability. The rate of credit growth and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes are closely monitored. In addition, the spread between policy rate and the loan interest rates driven by the announced macroprudential measures is closely monitored. The Committee will continue to further strengthen the tools supporting the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism.
Increase in inflation is driven by the lagged and indirect effects of rising energy costs resulting from geopolitical developments, effects of pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, strong negative supply shocks caused by the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices. The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken and decisively implemented for strengthening sustainable price and financial stability along with the resolution of the ongoing regional conflict. The effects of slowing foreign demand on aggregate demand conditions and production are closely monitored. It is critically important that financial conditions remain supportive to preserve the growth momentum in industrial production and the positive trend in employment in a period of increasing uncertainties regarding global growth as well as further escalation of  geopolitical risks. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to reduce the policy rate by 150 basis points. The Committee evaluated taking a similar step in the following meeting and ending the rate cut cycle. To create an institutional basis for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy framework continues with the aim of encouraging permanent and strengthened liraization in all policy tools of the CBRT. The credit, collateral and liquidity policy actions, of which the review process is finalized, will continue to be implemented to strengthen the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.
The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively within the framework of liraization strategy until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.

2022,27 October 2022,Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting,"No: 2022-44
27 October 2022
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting 
Meeting Date: 20 October 2022
Inflation Developments
1.    Consumer prices rose by 3.08% in September and annual inflation increased by 3.24 points to 83.45%. In this period, annual inflation decreased somewhat in the alcohol-tobacco-gold group whereas it went up in other groups. The most significant contribution to the rise in inflation came from energy and services groups. While the rise in energy inflation was driven by developments in items with administered prices such as electricity, natural gas, and municipal water as well as in solid fuel prices, fuel and bottled gas prices decreased in tandem with international crude oil prices. In September, annual inflation increased in services and food groups. In the core goods group, annual inflation decreased in durable goods while it rose in other subgroups. As the domestic energy prices were affected by natural gas prices that remained elevated due to geopolitical developments, the rise in producer prices accelerated driven by electricity production and gas manufacturing. Against this background, the seasonally adjusted monthly change in B and C indices decelerated somewhat while their annual inflation continued to increase.
2.    Prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 1.97% in September, and annual inflation rose by 2.80 points to 93.05% in this group. Annual inflation increased by 2.88 and 2.52 points to 82.39% and 102.90% in unprocessed and processed food, respectively. In unprocessed food, seasonally-adjusted data pointed to an upsurge in prices of fresh fruits and vegetables on the back of fresh fruit prices in September. In other unprocessed food, price hikes were notable for rice, eggs and nuts, while potato and red meat prices decreased. The increase in processed food prices was driven by bread and cereals as well as canned vegetables and sugar-related products.
3.    Energy prices surged by 7.39% in September and annual inflation in this group rose by 11.25 points to 132.98%. This was mainly driven by natural gas and electricity prices, which soared by 20.98% and 20.00%, respectively as a result of the changes in the residential tariffs. Meanwhile, municipal water and solid fuel prices also posted large increases. On the other hand, fuel oil and bottled gas prices decreased in this period following the decline in international crude oil prices.
4.    Services prices were up by 3.90% in September, and the group's annual inflation increased by 3.46 points to 57.76%. In this period, annual inflation increased across all subgroups, most visibly in transport services and rents. The rise in transport prices was mainly led by price hikes in urban passenger transport by bus due to school bus fares as well as in passenger transport by air and railway, despite the decline in the fares of intercity passenger transport by road. Against this backdrop, prices in transport went up by 6.95%, pushing annual inflation up by 7.69 points to 97.98%. Rents posted a monthly increase of 5.45%, and seasonally-adjusted data pointed to a continued acceleration trend. In the other services subgroup, the most significant items were education services due to the ongoing rises in university tuition fees and insurance services due to compulsory vehicle insurance. In the restaurants-hotels subgroup, prices increased at a more moderate pace compared to previous months, and annual inflation in this subgroup edged up by 0.39 points to 81.34%. 
5.    In September, annual inflation in core goods rose by 0.58 points to 77.49%. The 0.98% increase in prices of durable goods was led by electric and non-electric appliances, whereas the decline in furniture prices had a positive contribution. Thus, annual inflation in durable goods fell by 1.83 points to 89.96%. Due to the start of the new season, annual inflation in the clothing and footwear group increased by 2.24 points to 39.62%. In the other core goods subgroup, personal care products and household-related cleaning materials stood out, and the annual inflation in this group rose by 2.62 points to 82.74%.
6.    According to the October results of the Survey of Market Participants, current year-end inflation expectations remained relatively flat at 67.78%, while 12-month ahead inflation expectations increased slightly by 0.60 points to 37.34%. Meanwhile, 24-month ahead inflation expectations stood at 21.17%.
Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks 
7.    The weakening effects of geopolitical risks on global economic activity continue to increase. Global growth forecasts for the upcoming period are being revised downwards and recession is increasingly assessed as an inevitable risk factor.
8.    While the negative consequences of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly basic food, have been alleviated by the strategic solutions facilitated by Türkiye, the upward trend in producer and consumer prices continues on an international scale. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. Moreover, central banks in advanced economies emphasize that the rise in inflation may last longer than previously anticipated due to rising energy prices, imbalances between supply and demand, and rigidities in labor markets. The divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies continue to increase due to their diverse economic outlook. It is observed that central banks continue their efforts to develop new supportive measures and tools to cope with the increasing uncertainties in financial markets.
9.    Regarding portfolio flows to emerging economies, bond and equity markets have both continued to register outflows in October in line with the global risk appetite. Moreover, the volatility in the long-term bond yields in advanced economies and the course of global financial conditions keep the risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies alive.
10.    Due to the impact of the policy steps taken within the scope of the liraization strategy, Türkiye's Turkish lira-denominated government bond yields, especially in long maturities, performed more favorably in this period compared to peer economies.
11.    Increase in inflation is driven by the lagged and indirect effects of rising energy costs resulting from geopolitical developments, effects of pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, strong negative supply shocks caused by the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices.
12.    Despite moderate international commodity prices and transportation costs, natural gas prices that remained elevated due to geopolitical developments, affected domestic energy prices, leading to an increase in annual producer inflation driven by electricity production and gas manufacturing. According to the main industrial groupings, annual inflation increased across subcategories, more markedly in energy and non-durable consumption goods. Across sectors, in addition to electricity production and gas manufacturing, which recorded significant price increases amid high international natural gas prices, water treatment and distribution, clothing, coal-lignite, beverages and construction-related products also saw notable price hikes. Meanwhile, seasonally-adjusted underlying trend indicators for producer prices pointed that cost-based price pressures persisted, albeit at a weaker rate.
13.    A strong growth was observed in the first half of 2022. Leading indicators for the second half of the year continue pointing to a slowdown in growth due to the weakening foreign demand. While industrial production increased by 2.4 percent in August, adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects, compared to the previous month, it increased by 4.1 percent on an annual basis. Thus, the monthly production loss in the previous month due to bridge days was partially compensated. After growing by 1.9% and 0.9% in the first two quarters of the year, respectively, industrial production dropped by 3.9% in the third quarter as of August. In this period, the quarterly decline in industrial production spread across all manufacturing sectors except vehicles. The retail sales volume index increased quarter-on-quarter in August, but the quarterly growth rate slowed. Similarly, the quarterly increase in credit card spending lost momentum in the third quarter.
14.    Pressures on the manufacturing industry due to foreign demand and their currently limited impact on domestic demand and supply capacity are being monitored closely. Survey-based indicators such as Business Tendency Survey, PMI and sectoral confidence indices as well as other high-frequency data point to a continued slowdown in economic activity. Registered domestic and external orders and future order expectations of manufacturing industry firms reveals an ongoing weakening in total demand, which is more pronounced for external demand. Firms' investment and employment expectations declined as of September compared to the second quarter. Information obtained from field interviews also confirm this outlook for the economic activity in this period
15.    As of August, the quarterly employment growth slowed down in the third quarter in tandem with the decelerating economic activity. The seasonally-adjusted employment as per the averages of July and August increased by 0.4% (116 thousand people) compared to the previous quarter, and stood approximately 3.4 million people above its pre-pandemic level (February 2020). Nevertheless, this rate of increase remained below the quarterly employment growth in the first two quarters of 2022 (0.7% and 2.5%, respectively). Meanwhile, compared to peer economies, job creation has been stronger. Considering the sectors that contribute to the employment increase, it is observed that the growth dynamics are supported by structural gains. The seasonally adjusted labor force participation rate on a quarterly basis, which fell by 0.4 points to 52.8% as of August, is approximately 2 points above its pre-pandemic level. An evaluation on a monthly basis indicates that the downward effect of the August employment growth exceeded the upward effect of the increase in labor force participation on the unemployment rate. Thus, the unemployment rate declined by 0.4 points compared to previous month and realized as 9.6%. Survey indicators and high-frequency data indicate that the upward trend in employment remains in place, albeit with a loss of momentum.
16.    The strong course of energy and gold imports still affects the current account balance negatively. While the current account balance posted a deficit of USD 3.1 billion in August 2022, the annualized current account deficit increased by USD 4.2 billion to USD 40.9 billion. The provisional foreign trade data for September and the high frequency data for October suggest that the deceleration in exports continues. Having posted a limited deceleration excluding energy and gold, imports, on the other hand, have maintained their strength due to the high level of energy and gold imports. Despite the increase in the foreign trade deficit led by the surge in commodity prices, mainly energy prices, the ongoing uptrend in services revenues continue to support the current account balance. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, thanks to the increase in per capita tourist spending, the stronger than expected contribution of tourism revenues to the current account balance continues. On the other hand, high course of energy prices and the likelihood of a recession in main trade partners keep the risks on current account balance alive. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability.
Monetary Policy 
17.    The monetary policy stance will be determined by taking into account the evaluations on the source and permanence of risks, along with the extent to which they can be contained by monetary policy, and with a focus on achieving the sustainable price stability target, in a cautious manner.
18.    In formulating the monetary policy towards achieving the sustainable price stability objective, a liraization-oriented approach will be maintained that also addresses risks to financial stability. The rate of credit growth and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes are closely monitored. In addition, the spread between policy rate and the loan interest rates driven by the announced macroprudential measures is closely monitored. The Committee will continue to further strengthen the tools supporting the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism.
19.    The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken and decisively implemented for strengthening sustainable price and financial stability along with the resolution of the ongoing regional conflict. The effects of slowing foreign demand on aggregate demand conditions and production are closely monitored. It is critically important that financial conditions remain supportive to preserve the growth momentum in industrial production and the positive trend in employment in a period of increasing uncertainties regarding global growth as well as further escalation of geopolitical risks. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to reduce the policy rate by 150 basis points. The Committee evaluated taking a similar step in the following meeting and ending the rate cut cycle. 
20.    To create an institutional basis for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy framework continues with the aim of encouraging permanent and strengthened liraization in all policy tools of the CBRT. The focus of this process will be on developing policy instruments to support the improvement of Turkish lira deposits, to increase Turkish lira-denominated assets in the collateral structure of OMO funding, to gradually reduce the volume of swaps, and to strengthen foreign exchange reserves.
21.    The credit, collateral and liquidity policy actions, of which the review process is finalized, will continue to be implemented to strengthen the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. The rise in the demand for long-term fixed-income and Turkish lira-denominated assets and the course of the yield in tandem with the direction of the efficiency of monetary transmission is closely monitored. Along with credit growth, the Committee will also consider the improvement in financing costs of loans providing efficiency gains in targeted areas so as to maintain the transmission.
22.    Accordingly, the effects of liquidity and distribution developments of the Turkish lira on deposits and loan pricing, the effects of exchange rate developments on inflation, and the impact of the developments regarding FX-protected deposit products on reverse currency substitution, the depth and stability of the foreign exchange market, and price stability are being analyzed, and necessary policy measures are being taken.
23.    The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively within the framework of the liraization strategy until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability.
24.    Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.
25.    The Committee supports building strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders in order to achieve price stability.
26.    The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework."

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 10.5 percent to 9 percent.
The weakening effects of geopolitical risks on global economic activity continue to increase.

The comprehensive set of policies to be implemented will be published in the 2023 Monetary and Exchange Rate document in December.
Increase in inflation is driven by the lagged and indirect effects of rising energy costs resulting from geopolitical developments, effects of pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, strong negative supply shocks caused by the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices.

Accordingly, the Committee has decided to reduce the policy rate by 150 basis points. Considering the increasing risks regarding global demand, the Committee evaluated that the current policy rate is adequate and decided to end the rate cut cycle that started in August. To create an institutional basis for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy framework continues with the aim of encouraging permanent and strengthened liraization in all policy tools of the CBRT.

Open Banking Press Release




The Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye (CBRT) launches the Open Banking services in the payments area, which is considered an essential component of the digital economy roadmap of the Liraization Strategy. 
As of today, participating banks start providing services through the 'Open Banking Gateway' (GEÇİT) infrastructure, developed by the Interbank Card Center (ICC), that allows third parties to provide Open Banking transactions. 




Payment Initiation Service (subparagraph f) and the Service of Presenting Consolidated Information regarding the payment account on online platforms (subparagraph g) were added to the first paragraph of article 12 of the ""Law No. 6493 on Payment and Securities Settlement Systems, Payment Services and Electronic Money Institutions"" updated on 12 November 2019, defining those services as payment services within the scope of the Law. Thus, these two services, called Data Sharing in the Field of Payment Services (DSSP), are defined as Open Banking Services in the field of payment services provision.
Consistent with the regulatory framework, investigations have been carried out with the cooperation and collaboration of the CBRT and ICC in order to determine the DSSP implementation strategy and the detailed technical and operational requirements. The best global practices have been examined while considering the particular conditions and special needs of Türkiye. A shared platform has been designed for rapid integration of all stakeholders, which provides a low-cost, efficient and effective data sharing in the field of Payment Services. In this direction, GEÇİT (as an Application Programming Interface, API), has been developed and introduced by ICC using in-house capabilities and technical resources and facilities. GEÇİT allows the provision of safe, efficient, effective, low-cost and innovative business models for Open Banking in payment services domain.
As of today, six banks, as account servicing payment service providers, have successfully completed their tests and technical certifications and started to provide services through GEÇİT. Meanwhile, as a result of the work carried out by the DSSP Working Group, the DSSP API Principles and Rules (API Standard) document, in which the technical and operational requirements for DSSP has been prepared and publicly published on our Bank's website.
Besides Instant and Continuous Transfer of Funds (FAST) System, which allows 24/7/365 interbank instant fund transfer services; TR QR Code, which is the national QR Code Standard of Türkiye in the field of payments ecosystem; Easy Addressing System, which allows FAST payments to be made easily and quickly with a phone number, ID number or e-mail address instead of IBAN, the Data Sharing Services in the Field of Payment Services with the ""Digital Turkish Lira Collaboration Platform"" announced by the CBRT on September 15, 2021, whose medium and long-term aim is to ensure and maintain that lira payments as the most practical, pragmatic, cheapest and most inclusive means of payment, are in line with our digitalization goals and will make very important progressive contributions to Türkiye's goal of reaching to a full-fledged digital economy.

2022,1 December 2022,Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting,"No: 2022-49
1 December 2022
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting 
Meeting Date: 24 November 2022
Inflation Developments
1. Consumer prices rose by 3.54% in October and annual inflation increased by 2.06 points to 85.51%. In this period, annual inflation receded in energy and alcoholic beverages, tobacco products and gold groups, but increased in other groups, more markedly in food. While price increases were widespread across the food group, the rise in the prices of fresh fruits and vegetables continued in October, becoming the main driver of the increase in the group’s inflation. Annual core goods inflation was up across all subgroups, while the increase in annual inflation in clothing and footwear, which saw the effects of the new season, was more limited compared to other subgroups. In the services group, transportation services came to the forefront in line with the developments fuel prices as well as rents. Despite the hikes in fuel and municipal water prices, annual energy inflation declined. Having decreased somewhat in recent months, global natural gas prices remained still elevated and continued to negatively affect domestic energy prices. As a matter of fact, domestic producer prices rose further in October due to contributions from electricity generation and gas production sectors. Against this background, seasonally-adjusted monthly changes in B and C indices decelerated slightly, while their annual inflation continued to rise.
2. Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 6.00 points to 99.05%. While price increases were wide-spread across the group, annual inflation went up by 9.85 points to 92.24% in unprocessed food, and by 2.42 points to 105.32% in processed food. Seasonally-adjusted data indicated that the increase in the prices of fresh fruits and vegetables in the unprocessed food group persisted in October. In addition to fresh fruits and vegetables, the prices of eggs, nuts, rice, milk and red meat had an effect on the increase of prices in the unprocessed food subgroup. In the processed food subgroup, the increasing trend in the prices of bread and cereals persisted, with cheese and other dairy products, sugar-related products and canned vegetables were the other subitems that came to the forefront.
3. Energy prices were up by 2.37% in October, and annual inflation in this group fell by 4.92 points to 128.06%. The October price increase in the energy group was mainly driven by fuel prices, which rose by 3.15% in line with the rise in international crude oil prices. Municipal water, which posted a price hike of 7.17% due to the carry-over effects from the previous month, and solid fuels, whose prices rose by 2.19%, were the other items that stood out. Meanwhile, following the decline in international propane and butane prices, bottled gas prices fell by 1.69% and limited the increase of prices in the group.
4. Services prices were up by 2.63% in October, and the group's annual inflation increased by 2.48 points to 60.24%. In this period, annual inflation increased across all subgroups, most visibly in transport services and rents, as in September. The monthly increase in rents was 4.87%, pushing annual inflation in this subgroup up to 41.24%. Seasonally-adjusted data indicate that the monthly increase in the rent subgroup declined slightly compared to the previous month, yet remained high. Developments in fuel prices caused transport services prices to increase by 1.97%. Annual inflation in this subgroup rose by 4.22 points to 102.20% driven by urban passenger transport by bus as well as passenger transport by air. Developments in the restaurants-hotels subgroup were led by catering services in line with the food inflation outlook. Prices in other services were shaped mainly by various maintenance-repair, health services, recreation-culture items, and transportation insurance.
5. Annual inflation in core goods rose by 2.16 points to 79.65% in October. Prices of durable goods rose by 2.57% in October, which was driven predominantly by white goods prices. Thus, annual inflation in this subgroup climbed by 2.51 points to 92.47%. With visible effects of the new season, annual inflation in the clothing and footwear group increased by 1.01 points to 40.63%. Price hikes spread across the other core goods group, with personal care products and household-related cleaning materials still in the lead. Prices rose by 2.96% in this subgroup, and annual inflation increased by 2.64 points to 85.38%. Meanwhile, the tax base arrangement introduced to automobiles is expected to pull down the prices of automobiles in a certain segment in December, and affect the group's inflation positively.
6. According to the November results of the Survey of Market Participants, inflation expectations increased to some extent for the short term, but decreased for the long term. 12-month ahead inflation expectations rose slightly by 0.13 points to 37.47%.  On the other hand, 24-month ahead and 5-year ahead inflation expectations receded by 0.41 points to 20.76% and 0.17 points to 9.49%, respectively.
Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks 
7. The weakening effects of geopolitical risks on global economic activity continue to increase. Global growth forecasts for the upcoming period are being revised downwards and recession is increasingly assessed as an inevitable risk factor. 
8. While the negative consequences of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly basic food, have been alleviated by the strategic solutions facilitated by Türkiye, the upward trend in producer and consumer prices continues on an international scale. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. Moreover, central banks in advanced economies emphasize that the rise in inflation may last longer than previously anticipated due to high level of energy prices, imbalances between supply and demand, and rigidities in labor markets. The divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies continues to increase due to their diverse economic outlook. It is observed that central banks continue their efforts to develop new supportive measures and tools to cope with the increasing uncertainties in financial markets.
9. Regarding portfolio flows to emerging economies, bond and equity markets saw inflows in November parallel to the improved global risk appetite. On the other hand, the volatility in the long-term bond yields in advanced economies and the course of global financial conditions keep the risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies alive.
10. Due to the impact of the policy steps taken within the scope of the Liraization Strategy, Türkiye's Turkish lira-denominated government bond yields, especially in long maturities, performed more favorably in this period compared to peer economies.
11. Increase in inflation is driven by the lagged and indirect effects of rising energy costs resulting from geopolitical developments, effects of pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, strong negative supply shocks caused by the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices. 
12. In October, international commodity prices displayed a limited increase. Recently, the pressure on commodity markets has eased due to the weakening trend in global demand conditions that has become more manifest. Excluding energy, commodity prices slightly decreased in October. In crude oil markets, where a volatile course prevails, prices have increased as a result of supply-side decisions. Thanks to favorable stock developments, price movements in international natural gas prices have been more moderate. In addition to these developments, the decreasing trend in international transportation costs continues. On the other hand, despite the recent easing, the lagged effects of the cumulative cost increase in energy prices continue to affect domestic prices. As a matter of fact, the lagged effects of the rise in natural gas prices were reflected on domestic industrial energy tariffs in October, and rising energy costs had widespread effects on producer prices. An analysis of developments in producer prices by sectors reveals that following the price adjustments in electricity and natural gas prices, prices in the electricity-gas-steam and air conditioning and crude oil-natural gas sectors increased significantly and prices of clothing, refined petroleum products, non-metallic mineral products related to construction and beverages sectors displayed a noteworthy increase. Despite the energy-related developments, the seasonally-adjusted underlying trend indicators of producer prices pointed out that the cost-based pressures continued, albeit at a weaker rate.
13. A strong growth was observed in the first half of 2022. Leading indicators for the second half of the year continue pointing to a slowdown in growth due to the weakening foreign demand. In September, industrial production adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects decreased by 1.6% quarter-on-quarter against a 0.4% rise on an annual basis. Thus, having increased by 1.8% and 0.8% on a quarterly basis in the first two quarters, industrial production decreased by 4.1% in the third quarter. In this period, the quarterly decline in industrial production spread across all manufacturing sectors except vehicles. While the retail sales volume index and credit card spending continued to increase in the third quarter, their growth momentum decelerated on a quarterly basis.
14. Pressures on the manufacturing industry due to foreign demand and their currently limited impact on domestic demand and supply capacity have been more pronounced. In addition to industrial production realizations, survey-based indicators such as Business Tendency Survey, PMI and sectoral confidence indices as well as other high-frequency data point that the slowdown in economic activity continues. Registered domestic and external orders and future order expectations of manufacturing industry firms reveals an ongoing weakening in total demand, which is more pronounced for external demand. In the third quarter, firms' investment expectations remained flat while employment expectations decreased compared to the previous quarter. Information obtained from field interviews conducted in this quarter also confirm this outlook for the economic activity.
15. In the third quarter, quarterly employment growth slowed down in line with the deceleration in economic activity. In the same period, seasonally adjusted labor participation rate decreased by 0.4 points. On a monthly basis, the unemployment rate increased by 0.3 points in September compared to the previous month and was realized as 10.1%. Survey indicators and high-frequency data indicate that, although losing momentum, the upward trend in employment is maintained. On the other hand, employment gains are more positive compared to peer economies when the post-pandemic period is examined. When the sectors that contribute to the increase in employment are considered, it is seen that the growth dynamics are supported by structural gains. 
16. The strong course of energy and gold imports still affects the current account balance negatively. While the current account balance posted a deficit of USD 3 billion in September, the annualized current account deficit increased by USD 5.7 billion to USD 39.2 billion. The provisional foreign trade data for October suggest that the deceleration in exports continues. Having posted a slowdown excluding energy and gold, imports, on the other hand, have maintained their strength due to the high level of energy and gold imports. Despite the increase in the foreign trade deficit led by the surge in commodity prices, mainly energy prices, the ongoing uptrend in services revenues continues to support the current account balance. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, the stronger than expected contribution of tourism revenues to the current account balance continues. On the other hand, the high course of energy prices and the likelihood of a recession in main trade partners keep the risks on current account balance alive. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability.
Monetary Policy
17. The monetary policy stance will be determined by taking into account the evaluations on the source and permanence of risks, along with the extent to which they can be contained by monetary policy, and with a focus on achieving the sustainable price stability target, in a cautious manner.
18.    In formulating the monetary policy towards achieving the sustainable price stability objective, a liraization-oriented approach will be maintained that also addresses risks to financial stability. The rate of credit growth and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes are closely monitored. In addition, the spread between the policy rate and loan interest rates driven by the announced macroprudential measures is closely monitored. 
19. The Committee will continue to decisively use the tools supporting the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism and implement additional measures. In this framework, targets encouraging conversion to Turkish lira deposits under the Liraization Strategy have been fulfilled, and starting from the end of the year, commission rates applicable to required reserves for banks’ foreign currency deposits will be varied according to targets regarding Turkish lira deposit shares only.
20. The Committee expects the disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken and decisively implemented for strengthening sustainable price and financial stability along with the resolution of the ongoing regional conflict. The effects of slowing foreign demand on aggregate demand conditions and production are closely monitored. It is critically important that financial conditions remain supportive for the sustainability of structural gains in supply and investment capacity by preserving the growth momentum in industrial production and the positive trend in employment in a period of increasing uncertainties regarding global growth as well as further escalation of geopolitical risks.
21. The Committee assessed that the financing costs of companies’ production-oriented activities should be set at reasonable levels in order to minimize the probable effects of aforementioned global uncertainties and risks on investment and production capacity via a proactive approach, thereby maintaining the supply continuity and the current surplus capacity. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to reduce the policy rate by 150 basis points. Considering the increasing risks regarding global demand, the Committee evaluated that the current policy rate is adequate and decided to end the rate cut cycle that started in August.
22. To create an institutional basis for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy framework continues with the aim of encouraging permanent and strengthened liraization in all policy tools of the CBRT. The focus of this process will be on developing policy instruments to support the improvement of Turkish lira deposits, to increase Turkish lira-denominated assets in the collateral structure of OMO funding, to gradually reduce the volume of swaps, and to strengthen foreign exchange reserves.
23. The credit, collateral and liquidity policy actions, of which the review process has been finalized, will continue to be implemented to strengthen the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. The rise in the demand for long-term, fixed-income and Turkish lira-denominated assets and the course of the yield curve in tandem with the direction of the efficiency of monetary transmission are closely monitored. Along with credit growth, the Committee will also consider the improvement in financing costs of loans providing efficiency gains in targeted areas so as to maintain the transmission.
24. Accordingly, the effects of liquidity and distribution developments of the Turkish lira on deposits and loan pricing, the effects of exchange rate developments on inflation, and the impact of the developments regarding FX-protected deposit products on reverse currency substitution, the depth and stability of the foreign exchange market, and price stability are being analyzed, and necessary policy measures are being taken.
25.  The comprehensive set of policies to be implemented to boost the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism will be published in the 2023 Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy document in December.
26. The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively within the framework of Liraization Strategy until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium- term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability.
27. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.
28. The Committee supports building strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders in order to achieve price stability.
29.    The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework."

Press Release on Security Overlay Service (SIPER)




The Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye (CBRT) has introduced the “Security Overlay Service” (SIPER), a vital overlay service for the Instant and Continuous Transfer of Funds (FAST). SIPER enables real-time threat intelligence and information sharing for the detection and prevention of illicit transactions. The SIPER was developed in cooperation with the Interbank Card Center (BKM) with domestic and national resources.




The FAST System, which allows 24/7/365 instant transfer of funds, was launched in December 2020. Through the FAST, all users can make cheap and instant transfers of funds between their accounts at different financial institutions on a 24/7 basis where all the parties are informed about the result of the transactions instantly. As the fund transfers take place within seconds irrevocably, all kinds of security risks have to be managed instantenously. Thus, the CBRT has developed and launched the SIPER platform, which is an international best practice, to ensure the most secure conduct and broad-based use of instant payments. The operating principle of the SIPER platform is to secure the exchange of any information about the risk of an illecit transaction between the initiating and beneficiary institutions within seconds. Also, via the SIPER platform, all parties in the system will be informed about illicit transactions. The SIPER is planned to be used not only for FAST transactions but also for all kinds of fund transfers.
Although the SIPER has become recently available, four FAST participants have completed tests and technical certifications successfully, and as of today started using the platform. Additionally, two others have completed the testing and certification processes to join the SIPER. All the participants of the FAST are expected to integrate to the SIPER in the first quarter of 2023.
In the ongoing second phase of the SIPER platform, smart-layered strategic products are being developed using “Machine Learning” and “Artificial Intelligence” algorithms, which will allow detection of illegal uses as anomalies on the centrally collected data. The CBRT is planning to make these products available to all stakeholders in the payment ecosystem in the second half of 2023. 
The CBRT evaluates that the SIPER platform will make a significant contribution to ensuring that end users carry out all their digital payment transactions safely in the payments area of our Liraization Strategy, and that illegal use is minimized.

Press Release on Interest Rates
Participating Committee Members
Şahap Kavcıoğlu (Governor), Taha Çakmak, Mustafa Duman, Elif Haykır Hobikoğlu, Emrah Şener.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 9 percent.
Leading indicators point to continuation of recession concerns in developed economies as a result of ongoing geopolitical risks and interest rate hikes. While the negative consequences of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly basic food, have been alleviated by the strategic solutions facilitated by Türkiye, the high level in producer and consumer inflation continues on an international scale. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. The divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies continue to increase due to their diverse economic outlook. It is observed that central banks continue their efforts to develop new supportive measures and tools to cope with the increasing uncertainties in financial markets. Additionally, financial markets started to adjust their expectations that the central banks would end the rate hike cycles in the near term on the back of the increasing recession risks.
A strong growth was observed in the first three quarters of 2022. Leading indicators for the last quarter of the year continue pointing to a slowdown in growth due to the weakening foreign demand. However, the effects of foreign demand-based pressures observed in the manufacturing industry on domestic demand and supply capacity currently remain limited. Compared to peer economies, job creation has been stronger. Considering the sectors that contribute to the employment increase, it is observed that the growth dynamics are supported by structural gains. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, the stronger than expected contribution of tourism revenues to the current account balance continues. On the other hand, high level of energy prices and the likelihood of a recession in main trade partners keep the risks on current account balance alive. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability. The rate of credit growth and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes are closely monitored. The Committee will continue to decisively use the tools supporting the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism and the entire policy toolset, particularly funding channels, will be aligned with liraization targets. The comprehensive set of policies to be implemented will be published in the 2023 Monetary and Exchange Rate document in December. 
Increase in inflation has been driven by the lagged and indirect effects of rising energy costs resulting from geopolitical developments, effects of pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, strong negative supply shocks caused by the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices. The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken and decisively implemented for strengthening sustainable price and financial stability along with the resolution of the ongoing regional conflict. The effects of slowing foreign demand on aggregate demand conditions and production are closely monitored. It is critically important that financial conditions remain supportive for the sustainability of structural gains in supply and investment capacity by preserving the growth momentum in industrial production and the positive trend in employment in a period of increasing uncertainties regarding global growth as well as further escalation of geopolitical risks. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. Considering the increasing risks regarding global demand, the Committee evaluated that the current policy rate is adequate. To create an institutional basis for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy framework continues with the aim of encouraging permanent and strengthened liraization in all policy tools of the CBRT. The credit, collateral and liquidity policy actions, of which the review process is finalized, will continue to be implemented to strengthen the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.
The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively within the framework of liraization strategy until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.
The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

Press Release on the Participation of Payment and Electronic Money Institutions in the FAST System




The Instant and Continuous Transfer of Funds (FAST) System, which was designed and developed by the Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye (CBRT) with internal human resource capital through the use of open-source softwares and made operational in 2021, has recently 24 participating banks.
In 2023, Payment and Electronic Money Institutions will also be allowed to directly participate in the FAST System.
The preparations for FAST Merchant Payments have been completed, and will also be launched in the first quarter of 2023.




The FAST System, a new generation 24/7/365 instant payment system, operated by the CBRT and launched on January 8, 2021, meets the need for instant fund transfers and payments at any time and is being widely used increasing every day. In the FAST System, 6.4 million payments, amounting to an average of 7.9 billion TL per day, are executed instantaneusly between accounts.
The number of registered users in the Easy Addressing System, which enables payments to be initiated instantly and practically by using Turkish idendity numbers (TCKN), phone numbers or e-mail addresses instead of IBAN, has reached 19 million, and is growing constantly. 
To increase the scope and coverage of the FAST System, which is an important component of the digital economy roadmap within the context of the CBRT's Liraization Strategy, Payment and E-Money Institutions that fulfill the pre-determined requirements will be allowed to directly participate in the FAST System in 2023. This development is expected to support and improve the competition and innovation within the payments ecosystems and contribute to the provision of new and value-added services. 
In addition, preparations for FAST Merchant Payments, which will enable the FAST System to be used as a complementary to existing payment tools, have also been completed. FAST Merchant Payments, which provides instant payment from account to account, via scanning the TR-QR Code displayed on the screens of mobile applications and Point of Sale (POS) devices, will make the day-to-day lives of all our citizens easier. FAST Merchant Payments and innovative applications that support person-to-person payments wii be launched in the first quarter of 2023.

29 December 2022
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting 
Meeting Date: 22 December 2022
Inflation Developments
1. Consumer prices rose by 2.88% in November, and annual inflation decreased by 1.12 points to 84.39%. The fall in annual inflation was driven by energy and core goods groups, and food price developments stood out in monthly inflation. While annual inflation declined across all subgroups of core goods, energy prices were mild and annual energy inflation dropped due to the base effect. Price increases spread across the food group, and the fresh fruits and vegetables item and prices of milk and dairy products were the leading drivers of the rise in annual food inflation. Led by declines in refined petroleum product and base metal industry prices as well as in electricity and natural gas production prices, the monthly rate of increase in producer prices decelerated significantly. Accordingly, annual producer inflation decreased. Against this background, the slowdown in seasonally-adjusted monthly change in B and C indices continued while their annual inflation went down.
2.    Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 3.50 points to 102.55%. While price increases spread across the group, annual inflation increased by 5.00 points to 97.24% in unprocessed food, and by 2.03 points to 107.35% in processed food. In unprocessed food, seasonally-adjusted data pointed to an accelerated rise in fresh fruit and vegetable prices in November, which was mainly driven by irregularities in the transition from field to greenhouse and the effect of new products included in the index in fruits. The price hike in the unprocessed food subgroup was led by developments in prices of milk in particular, as well as rice, potatoes and pulses, in addition to prices of fresh fruits and vegetables. The increase in processed food prices was mainly driven by cheese and other dairy products, which were affected by raw milk prices, as well as bread and cereals, fats and oils, non-alcoholic beverages and canned vegetables.
3.    Up by 1.28% in November, energy prices were milder compared to recent months, and annual inflation in this group decreased by 10.06 points to 118.00% due to the base effect. The monthly increase is attributable to the 1.19% rise in fuel prices. While municipal water prices went up by 3.33% in this period, bottled gas prices rose by 2.73% following the developments in international propane and butane prices. Leading indicators suggest a fuel prices-led decline in energy prices in December due to the fall in crude oil prices.
4.    Prices of services rose by 2.18% in November, and the group's annual inflation increased by 0.48 points to 60.72%. In this period, annual inflation increased in rents and communication services, but decreased in other subgroups. Seasonally-adjusted data indicate that the deceleration in the monthly increase of rents seen in the previous month also continued in November. In the communications subgroup, the 2.96% increase in prices was mainly due to telephone call and internet fees, and annual inflation in this subgroup climbed to 29.17%. Prices in the other services subgroup rose by 1.41% month-on-month, with maintenance-repair, recreational and sporting services, household services and insurance services in the lead. Driven by catering services, prices in the restaurants-hotels subgroup rose by 3.18%, whereas annual inflation dropped to 80.30% due to the base effect. Prices in transport services remained relatively flat, and annual inflation fell by 1.54 points.
5.    Annual inflation in core goods dropped by 3.54 points to 76.11%. In this period, prices of durable goods picked up by 2.46%, which was driven predominantly by white goods, furniture and automobile prices but annual inflation in this subgroup decreased by 2.97 points to 89.50% due to the base effect. Analyses of the course of producer and consumer prices in the durable consumption goods sector indicate that annual producer inflation and consumer inflation in this group are at similar levels as producer price developments have been reflected on consumer prices within a short time. In the other core goods subgroup, prices increased by 2.17% month-on-month, still being led by personal care products and household-related cleaning materials, whereas annual inflation declined by 3.74 points to 81.64%. Contrary to seasonal trends, prices in the clothing and footwear subgroup fell by 1.54% on a monthly basis in November, pulling annual inflation down by 4.41 points to 36.22%.
6.    According to the December results of the Survey of Market Participants, inflation expectations decreased. The current year-end inflation expectations dropped by 1.26 points to 66.80%. The 12-month ahead inflation expectations were revised down by 2.55 points to 34.92%. Meanwhile, 24-month ahead and 5-year ahead inflation expectations receded by 0.20 and 0.38 points to 20.56% and 9.11%, respectively.
Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks
7.    Leading indicators point to continuation of recession concerns in developed economies as a result of ongoing geopolitical risks and interest rate hikes.
8.    While the negative consequences of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly basic food, have been alleviated by the strategic solutions facilitated by Türkiye, the high level in producer and consumer inflation continues on an international scale. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. 
9.    The divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies continue to increase due to their diverse economic outlook. It is observed that central banks continue their efforts to develop new supportive measures and tools to cope with the increasing uncertainties in financial markets. Additionally, financial markets started to adjust their expectations that the central banks would end the rate hike cycles in the near term on the back of the increasing recession risks.
10.    Regarding portfolio flows to emerging economies, bond and equity markets saw inflows in December parallel to the improved global risk appetite. On the other hand, the volatility in the long-term bond yields in advanced economies and the course of global financial conditions keep the risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies alive.
11.    Due to the impact of the policy steps taken within the scope of the Liraization Strategy, Türkiye's Turkish lira-denominated government bond yields, especially in long maturities, performed more favorably in this period compared to peer economies.
12.    Increase in inflation has been driven by the lagged and indirect effects of rising energy costs resulting from geopolitical developments, effects of pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, strong negative supply shocks caused by the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices.
13.    International commodity prices dropped in November. As for sub-groups, industrial metal prices increased and diverged from other sub-groups. International crude oil prices slightly decreased in November, and the decrease became more evident in December. The retreat in natural gas prices continued in November as well. International transportation costs maintained their downward trend in November. Moreover, exchange rates have followed a moderate course over the last few months. On the back of these developments, the monthly rate of increase in producer prices slowed down significantly led by the decline in electricity and natural gas production, refined petroleum products and basic metal industry prices, and annual producer inflation decreased. An analysis of annual inflation by main industry groups reveals that annual inflation decreased in all sub-groups, particularly in energy. When analyzed by sectors, prices of electricity, natural gas manufacturing, refined petroleum products and base metal industry decreased, while prices of other mining and quarrying, leather, paper and non-metallic mineral products related to construction increased. The seasonally-adjusted underlying trend indicators of producer prices point that the weakening trend in cost pressures continues.
14.    A strong growth was observed in the first three quarters of 2022. In the third quarter of 2022, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased by 3.9% on an annual basis, while growth in the first three quarters of the year was 6.2% compared to the same period of the previous year. While the main driver of annual growth in the third quarter was the services sector, the contribution of the industrial sector to growth remained limited due to the weakening foreign demand. While the share of sustainable components in economic growth increases, the share of the contributions of machinery-equipment investments and net exports accounted for approximately 62% of the average annual growth in the first three quarters of the year.
15.    Leading indicators for the last quarter of the year continue pointing to a slowdown in growth due to the weakening foreign demand. In October, industrial production increased by 2.4%, adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects, on a monthly basis and it increased by 3.1% on an annual basis. However, when production developments are analyzed at the sectoral level, it is observed that the production of computers, electronics, optical products and other transportation vehicles sectors, which have a relatively high export intensity and typically exhibit high volatility, increased significantly (27.5% and 53.2%, respectively) on a monthly basis; when these two sectors are excluded, the monthly increase in industrial production was 0.7%. On a quarterly basis, the rise in industrial production in the fourth quarter as of October was 2.1%, while the increase in industrial production remained limited at 0.6% when typically volatile sectors were excluded.
16.    The effects of foreign demand-based pressures observed in the manufacturing industry on domestic demand and supply capacity currently remain limited. Survey-based indicators such as the Business Tendency Survey and PMI as well as other high-frequency data indicate that the deceleration in economic activity continues. Manufacturing industry firms’ registered domestic and external orders and future order expectations reveal that the decrease in export order expectations continued in the last quarter, albeit at a slower pace, while domestic market order expectations remained flat. In this context, despite the weakening in external demand, domestic demand has followed a relatively mild course. As a matter of fact, while the retail sales volume index increased by 1.4% on a monthly basis in October, as of November, the uptrend in credit card expenditures continued in the last quarter. Meanwhile, firms’ investment and employment expectations for the future decreased slightly in the last quarter.
17.    In October, seasonally-adjusted employment grew by 0.7% monthly, and by 1.0% quarterly. In the same period, seasonally-adjusted labor participation rate increased by 0.4 points to 53.5%. Despite the rise in employment, seasonally-adjusted total unemployment rate increased by 0.1 points in October compared to the previous month and reached as 10.2% due to the increase in the labor participation rate. Survey indicators and high-frequency data indicate that, although losing momentum, the upward trend in employment is maintained. On the other hand, compared to peer economies, job creation has been stronger when the post-pandemic period is examined. Considering the sectors that contribute to the employment increase, it is observed that the growth dynamics are supported by structural gains. 
18.    The strong course of energy and gold imports still affects the current account balance negatively. While the current account balance posted a deficit of USD 0.4 billion in October, the annualized current account deficit increased by USD 4.5 billion to USD 43.5 billion. The provisional foreign trade data for November suggest that seasonally-adjusted exports and imports increased on a monthly basis, partially offsetting the deceleration in the previous month. Foreign trade deficit stood at USD 8.8 billion in November due to energy and gold imports, which maintained their relatively high levels. Despite the increase in the foreign trade deficit led by the surge in commodity prices, mainly energy prices, coupled with the acceleration in gold imports, the ongoing uptrend in services revenues continues to support the current account balance. The stronger-than-expected contribution of tourism revenues to the current account balance continues. On the other hand, high level of energy prices and the likelihood of a recession in main trade partners keep the risks on current account balance alive. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability.
Monetary Policy
19.    The monetary policy stance will be determined by taking into account the evaluations on the source and permanence of risks, along with the extent to which they can be contained by monetary policy, and with a focus on achieving the sustainable price stability target, in a cautious manner.
20.    In formulating the monetary policy towards achieving the sustainable price stability objective, a liraization-oriented approach will be maintained that also addresses risks to financial stability. The rate of credit growth and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes are closely monitored.
21.    The Committee will continue to decisively use the tools supporting the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism and the entire policy toolset, particularly funding channels, will be aligned with liraization targets. The comprehensive set of policies to be implemented will be published in the 2023 Monetary and Exchange Rate document in December. 
22.    The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken and decisively implemented for strengthening sustainable price and financial stability along with the resolution of the ongoing regional conflict. The effects of slowing foreign demand on aggregate demand conditions and production are closely monitored.
23.    It is critically important that financial conditions remain supportive for the sustainability of structural gains in supply and investment capacity by preserving the growth momentum in industrial production and the positive trend in employment in a period of increasing uncertainties regarding global growth as well as further escalation of geopolitical risks. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. Considering the increasing risks regarding global demand, the Committee evaluated that the current policy rate is adequate. 
24.    To create an institutional basis for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy framework continues with the aim of encouraging permanent and strengthened liraization in all policy tools of the CBRT. The focus of this process will be on developing policy instruments to support the improvement of Turkish lira deposits, to increase Turkish lira-denominated assets in the collateral structure of OMO funding, to gradually reduce the volume of swaps, and to strengthen foreign exchange reserves.
25.    The credit, collateral and liquidity policy actions, of which the review process has been finalized, will continue to be implemented to strengthen the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. The rise in the demand for long-term, fixed-income and Turkish lira-denominated assets and the course of the yield curve in tandem with the direction of the efficiency of monetary transmission are closely monitored. Along with credit growth, the Committee will also consider the improvement in financing costs of loans providing efficiency gains in targeted areas so as to maintain the transmission.
26.    Accordingly, the effects of liquidity and distribution developments of the Turkish lira on deposits and loan pricing, the effects of exchange rate developments on inflation, and the impact of the developments regarding FX-protected deposit products on reverse currency substitution, the depth and stability of the foreign exchange market, and price stability are being analyzed, and necessary policy measures are being taken.
27.    The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively within the framework of liraization strategy until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. 
28.    Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.
29.    The Committee supports building strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders in order to achieve price stability.
30.    The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework."

Press Release on Macroprudential Measures
It has been stated in the Monetary Policy and Liraization Strategy for 2023 that policies implemented to permanently increase the weight of the Turkish lira in both assets and liabilities of the banking system will continue to be used in a strengthened manner, policies that support the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism will be maintained, financial stability will also continue to be safeguarded as a supporting factor for permanent price stability, and policies will be introduced that require the use of foreign currency deposits to fund foreign currency loans to the maximum extent. 
As per Article 4 of the Central Bank Law No. 1211, reserve requirement and liquidity requirement implementations that take into consideration the deemed-appropriate on-balance sheet or off-balance sheet items of banks and other financial institutions are among the fundamental duties of the Central Bank. In this respect, practices introduced in 2022 continue to be implemented in a strengthened manner in line with the revised liraization strategy. 
Accordingly, the following changes have been made in the securities maintainance and reserve requirement practices: 
1. In addition to banks, other financial institutions have also been included in the scope of the securities maintenance regulation, and at the first phase, factoring companies have been required to maintain securities according to the interest rate they apply to Turkish lira-denominated factoring receivables.
2. The period of the implementations that stipulate banks to maintain securities according to loan interest rate and loan growth rate has been extended until 29 December 2023.
3. The scope of assets and liabilities of banks subject to the securities maintenance practice has been expanded to cover:
a. On the liabilities side, funds obtained from FX-denominated repo transactions with domestic real persons and the real sector,
b. Transactions to derecognize FX liabilities subject to the securities maintenance via engaging in financial derivative transactions with FX funders, and
c. Securities on the assets side, issued by the real sector and the features of which are determined by the Bank.
4. The securities maintenance practice introduced will ensure a balanced course in FX loans in line with the decline in foreign currency funding items.
5. The facilities of maintaining gold for Turkish lira reserve requirements have been terminated as of 23 June 2023.
These amendments have been published in the Official Gazette, and details will be shared with banks and factoring companies via implementation instructions.

Press Release on Interest Rates
Participating Committee Members
Naci Ağbal (Governor), Murat Çetinkaya, Ömer Duman, Uğur Namık Küçük, Oğuzhan Özbaş, Emrah Şener, Abdullah Yavaş.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 17 percent.
Economic activity is on a strong course. Although the downward effects of the pandemic-related restrictions on the economy are more confined compared to the second quarter of last year, the slowdown in activity in services and related sectors and uncertainties surrounding the short-run outlook of these sectors prevail. The strengthening domestic demand, due to the cumulative effects of high credit growth during the pandemic, continues to have an adverse effect on the current account balance. Nevertheless, credit growth has started to slow down amid tighter financial conditions.
Domestic demand conditions, cumulative cost effects, in particular the exchange rate effects, increasing international food and other commodity prices and high levels of inflation expectations continue to affect the pricing behavior and inflation outlook adversely. The decelerating impact of the strong monetary tightening implemented in November and December MPC meetings on credit and domestic demand is expected to become more significant; hence the effects of demand and cost factors on inflation are envisaged to wane gradually. On the other hand, the developments in international commodity prices, supply constraints intensifying in some sectors, and the adjustments in wage and administered prices maintain their importance for the medium-term inflation outlook. Accordingly, the MPC, taking into account the end-2021 forecast target, has decided to maintain decisively the tight monetary policy stance for an extended period until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and price stability. As regards to the indicators pointing to a permanent fall in inflation and price stability, indicators for the underlying trend of inflation and pricing behavior, diffusion indices, demand and cost factors, and inflation expectations will be monitored closely for their compatibility with the targets in the forecast horizon. Additional monetary tightening will be delivered if needed.
The tight monetary policy stance, besides attaining permanent price stability, will foster macroeconomic and financial stability positively by facilitating the fall in country risk premium, the reversal in currency substitution, the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and the perpetual decline in financing costs.
In its decision-making process, the CBRT adopts a framework with a medium term perspective, based on analyzing all factors affecting inflation and the interaction between these factors. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

2021,28 January 2021,Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting,"No: 2021-05
28 January 2021
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 21 January 2021
Inflation Developments
1.    In December, consumer prices were up by 1.25% and annual inflation rose by 0.57 points, ending the year 2020 at 14.60%. The rise in inflation was mainly driven by the core goods group. While energy inflation increased due to international oil prices, the rise in services inflation remained limited. The strong upward trend in seasonally-adjusted food prices persisted whereas annual food inflation somewhat declined due to the base effect. Against this background, annual inflation rates and trends of B and C indices increased significantly.
2.    Prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 2.53% in December but annual inflation in this group dropped by 0.47 points to 20.61% due to the base effect. Annual inflation in processed and unprocessed food stood at 15.52% and 26.34%, respectively. Seasonally-adjusted prices of fresh fruits and vegetables increased by approximately 10% cumulatively in November and December. Sharp increases in international prices and cumulative exchange rate effects were determinant in the food group excluding fresh fruits and vegetables. The strong upward trend continued in prices of eggs, white meat, rice and pulses that are among the main food items. In the processed food group, prices of bread and cereals remained on the rise while fats and oils also continued to post high increases. The last four months’ cumulative increase in prices of fats and oils exceeded 20%. High-frequency data indicate that the rise in the reference price of raw milk is reflected in a wide range of the related food items.
3.    In December, energy prices were up by 1.47% and annual energy inflation rose to 5.64%. This rise was mainly driven by fuel prices that increased by 3.5% due to the rise in international oil prices. It is expected that even though there is an appreciation in the Turkish lira, crude oil prices will increase at a higher rate in January and group inflation will continue to climb due to hikes in administered prices. 
4.    Prices of core goods went up by 1.42% in December while annual core goods inflation rose by 1.92 points to 17.24%. Cost pressures arising from the lagged effects of exchange rates, the increasing trend in international metal prices and aggregate demand conditions reinforce the strong upward trend in durable goods prices. The rapid increases in durable goods prices spread across subcategories while annual inflation in this group reached 30.40%. The gradual rise continued in other core goods inflation in which the exchange rate pass-through is observed with a lag. In the clothing and footwear group, prices dropped below its previous year level due to the weak course of demand. The Committee assessed the inflationary effects of the pandemic-led divergences in sectoral demand conditions and highlighted the tourism-driven upside risks to the clothing group in the upcoming period.
5.    In December, services prices increased by 0.59% and annual services inflation rose by 0.24 points to 11.66%. While annual inflation remained almost flat in restaurants-hotels and transport services, it increased in other subcategories. Despite the rise in food inflation, annual inflation in restaurants-hotels remained relatively flat due to pandemic-related restrictions. On the other hand, the extension of VAT cuts on some items of the services sector affected the inflation outlook favorably. The Committee assessed that pandemic-led dynamics have contained the services inflation. The Committee also underlined the normalization-related upside risks during the year due to the relatively low course of inflation in accommodation, education, transport, recreational and cultural services items. In addition, some Committee members considered that minimum wage increase, which is higher compared to inflation targets, would adversely affect the inflation outlook through the channel of service prices and increasing inflation rigidity. 
6.    Inflation expectations remain high. The Committee agreed that the tight monetary policy stance should be maintained decisively for the year-end inflation expectation of 11.15% in CBRT Survey of Expectations, to converge to the end-2021 forecast target. The information value of survey-based and market pricing-based expectations in terms of the pricing behavior was also discussed. Twelve-month-ahead inflation expectations decreased by 0.31 points to 10.53% while 24-month-ahead inflation expectations were down 0.10 points to 9.14%. Some Committee members associated the improved medium-term expectations with the tight monetary policy stance despite news on minimum wage and administered prices, which are expected to weigh on the inflation outlook, and stated that the commitment to fight inflation would play a critical role in anchoring expectations.
Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks
7.    Global economic activity data indicate that partial recovery since the third quarter continues. However, despite ongoing vaccination efforts, uncertainties surrounding the global economic activity prevail due to the recent increase in Covid-19 cases. Pandemic-related restrictions in European countries mostly affect the services sector, while manufacturing industry activities remain buoyant. Strong exports to the region confirm this outlook. 
8.    Advanced and emerging economies maintain their expansionary monetary and fiscal stances. While long-term interest rates remain at historic lows across advanced economies, both central bank statements and market expectations suggest that the low interest rate environment is likely to continue for a long period. The effectiveness of these policies on financial markets, growth and employment will depend on the course of the pandemic and the available policy room in each country.
9.    Emerging economy portfolio markets continued to attract large volume of inflows since the previous MPC meeting due to improved risk sentiment. In January, bond markets saw an increase in inflows across emerging economies, while inflows to equity markets were slightly down. 
10.    Crude oil prices soared after the previous MPC meeting. In addition, the ongoing rise in commodity prices excluding energy, specifically agricultural commodities and industrial metals have an adverse affect on both producer and consumer inflation. Inflation is quite high in paper products and basic metals sectors, which are main input providers for the manufacturing industry. Supply constraints have become more pronounced as delivery times lengthened in those and related sectors. Other items driving producer inflation higher include vegetable oils, animal feed, vehicles and electronic products. These items affect consumer inflation through food and durable goods. The Committee noted the important role of commodity prices in continuing inflationary pressures despite the appreciation in the Turkish lira, and drew attention to the upside risks for the coming months. 
11.    Economic activity is on a strong course. In November, industrial production index increased by 1.3% month-on-month and 8.7% year-on-year. Thus, in the October-November period, production strengthened on the back of a 4.2% increase compared to the third quarter. While turnover and retail trade volume indices also strengthened compared to the third quarter, economic activity was considerably buoyant in services excluding tourism-related sectors as well as in trade. Hence, pre-pandemic levels were exceeded widely across sectors excluding industrial and services sector groups that were adversely affected by the pandemic. Survey indicators for January suggested that the increase in the manufacturing industry capacity utilization rate continues with a more pronounced trend in intermediate goods and durable goods sectors. In particular, the strong course of both domestic and foreign demand in the production of electrical equipment that also includes white goods sector, along with its effects on inflation are noteworthy. Employment developments also confirm the strong outlook in the industrial sector.
12.    Although the downward effects of the pandemic-related restrictions on the economy are more confined compared to the second quarter of last year, the slowdown in activity in services and related sectors and uncertainties surrounding the short-run outlook of these sectors prevail. Restrictions imposed since early November due to the increasing number of cases have reduced the country-wide mobility significantly. Travel, catering and recreation were the sectors hardest hit by the pandemic, as was the case in earlier phases of the pandemic. The Committee assessed that the inflationary effects of the sectoral divergences that emerged due to pandemic dynamics and the macro policy mix, along with the risks they imply for the period ahead should be monitored.
13.    Evaluating the output gap indicators related to the cyclical state of the economy, the Committee concluded that despite the constraining effect of unemployment and tourism, aggregate demand conditions remained inflationary in the last quarter due to the cumulative effects of the strong credit impulse and external demand. It was judged that economic activity reached its cyclical peak in the last quarter and started to converge towards its trend owing to the deceleration in the first quarter. Some members of the Committee indicated that the deceleration in the first quarter was largely driven by the sectors adversely affected by the pandemic restrictions and that the effects of the monetary policy tightening are yet to be felt. Accordingly, demand-side inflationary effects continue to exist in the first quarter although they will subside gradually in the upcoming period. 
14.    The strengthening domestic demand, due to the cumulative effects of high credit growth during the pandemic, continues to have an adverse effect on the current account balance. Although economic activity has decelerated in European countries due to the recent increase in cases, the fact that pandemic restrictions do not cover the manufacturing industry activity supports the outlook for exports.  While a partial deceleration is observed in the import demand, gold imports are still above their historical averages. While evaluating the implications of the residents’ dollarization trend on external balance, the Committee discussed the dynamics of gold trade. 
15.    Credit growth has started to slow down amid tighter financial conditions. Attaching a particular importance to the composition of loans in terms of its effects on external balance and inflation, the Committee, in view of the four-week trends, evaluated the slowdown in personal loans positively. The limiting effect of the slowdown in loans on domestic demand and imports is expected to be more pronounced in the upcoming period. The Committee underscored once again the importance of the course of the current account balance in terms of a lasting recovery in economic activity and financial stability.
16.    Pandemic-related restrictions affect the labor market. In the October period, total and non-farm unemployment rates in seasonally-adjusted terms rose by 0.1 points each and realized as 12.9% and 14.9%, respectively. Non-farm employment remained flat, while the effects of the pandemic differ across sectors. Employment in services sectors that are affected more adversely by the restrictions such as accommodation and food services decreased, whereas sectors with continuing activity such as information-communication and transport-storage registered higher employment figures. Backed by the uptrend in exports, employment in the industrial sector also diverges positively in this period.
Monetary Policy
17.    The Committee re-emphasized that monetary policy decisions will be taken within the framework of inflation targeting regime and with the priority of price stability. The monetary policy stance will be set taking into account the upside risks to the inflation outlook and with a focus on bringing inflation down permanently in a cautious manner and achieving price stability target.
18.    Domestic demand conditions, cumulative cost effects, in particular the exchange rate effects, increasing international food and other commodity prices and high levels of inflation expectations continue to affect the pricing behavior and inflation outlook adversely. The decelerating impact of the strong monetary tightening implemented in November and December MPC meetings on credit and domestic demand is expected to become more significant; hence the effects of demand and cost factors on inflation are envisaged to wane gradually.
19.    On the other hand, the developments in international commodity prices, supply constraints intensifying in some sectors, and the adjustments in wage and administered prices remain important to the medium-term inflation outlook. As the lagged effects of the credit slowdown are expected to become apparent in the upcoming period, inflation may increase further in the coming few months due to supply-side inflationary factors that are significant in the short run. The additional inflation rigidity to be driven by the minimum wage through the services prices channel in particular, necessitates an extended period of a tight monetary policy stance compared to past projections. The tight monetary stance will serve as a significant buffer against external and temporary volatilities in the context of inflation expectations, pricing behavior and financial market developments.
20.    Accordingly, the MPC, taking into account the end-2021 forecast target, has decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance decisively for an extended period until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and price stability. As regards to the indicators pointing to a permanent fall in inflation and price stability, indicators for the underlying trend of inflation and pricing behavior, diffusion indices, demand and cost factors, and inflation expectations will be monitored closely for their compatibility with the targets in the forecast horizon. Additional monetary tightening will be delivered if needed. Besides the current information set, if any new information arrives pointing at the risk of inflation expectations and pricing behavior diverging from the medium-term target path, additional front-loaded tightening will be implemented.
21.    The tight monetary policy stance, besides attaining permanent price stability, will foster macroeconomic and financial stability positively by facilitating the fall in country risk premium, the reversal in currency substitution, the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and the perpetual decline in financing costs.
22.    The Committee reiterated its judgement that in order to achieve price stability, a strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders are required.
23.    In its decision-making process, the CBRT adopts a framework with a medium term perspective, based on analyzing all factors affecting inflation and the interaction between these factors. 
24.    It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance."

Press Release on Interest Rates
Participating Committee Members
Naci Ağbal (Governor), Murat Çetinkaya, Ömer Duman, Uğur Namık Küçük, Oğuzhan Özbaş, Emrah Şener, Abdullah Yavaş.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 17 percent.
Economic activity is on a strong course. While the downward effects of the pandemic-related restrictions on the economy have been limited, the slowdown in activity in services and related sectors and uncertainties surrounding the short-run outlook of these sectors prevail. The strengthening domestic demand, due to the cumulative effects of high credit growth during the pandemic, continues to have an adverse effect on the current account balance. Nevertheless, credit growth has started to slow down amid tighter financial conditions.
Domestic demand conditions, cumulative cost effects, in particular the exchange rate effects, increasing international food and other commodity prices and high levels of inflation expectations continue to affect the pricing behavior and inflation outlook adversely. The decelerating impact of the strong monetary tightening on credit and domestic demand is expected to become more significant; hence the effects of demand and cost factors on inflation are envisaged to wane gradually. On the other hand, the ongoing upward trend in international commodity prices, supply constraints intensifying in some sectors, and the adjustments in wage and administered prices maintain their importance for the medium-term inflation outlook. Accordingly, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained decisively, taking into account the end-2021 forecast target, for an extended period until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and price stability. In regard to the indicators pointing to a permanent fall in inflation and price stability, indicators for the underlying trend of inflation and pricing behavior, diffusion indices, demand and cost factors, and inflation expectations are monitored closely for their compatibility with the targets in the forecast horizon. Additional monetary tightening will be delivered if needed.
The balance between the monetary policy rate and actual/expected inflation will be sustained decisively to maintain a strong disinflationary effect until permanent price stability and the 5 percent target are reached. Sustaining the tight monetary policy stance in such a manner, besides attaining permanent price stability, will foster macroeconomic and financial stability positively by facilitating the fall in country risk premium, the reversal in currency substitution, the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and the perpetual decline in financing costs.
In its decision-making process, the CBRT adopts a framework with a medium term perspective, based on analyzing all factors affecting inflation and the interaction between these factors. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

 Press Release on Reserve Requirements




In line with its main objective of price stability, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey revised the reserve requirement regulation to improve the effectiveness of monetary transmission mechanism.




In the “Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2021” text, it is stated that reserve requirement ratios will be used as an instrument to support the monetary stance and the monetary transmission mechanism in pursuit of the price stability objective within a plain framework.
Accordingly:

Turkish lira reserve requirement ratios have been increased by 200 basis points for all liability types and maturity brackets.
The upper limit of the facility for holding FX has been decreased from 30% to 20% of Turkish lira reserve requirements.
The upper limit of the facility for holding standard gold has been decreased from 20% to 15% of Turkish lira reserve requirements.

As a result of these changes, TL-denominated required reserves are expected to increase by approximately TRY 25 billion, while total required reserves in FX and gold are expected to decrease by USD 0.5 billion, should the reserve option utilization rates remain unchanged for the remaining tranches.
In addition, the remuneration rate applied to TL-denominated required reserves has been increased by 150 basis points to 13.5%.
These changes will be effective from the calculation date of 19 February 2021 with the maintenance period starting on 5 March 2021.

2021,25 February 2021,Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting,"No: 2021-11
25 February 2021
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 18 February 2021
Inflation Developments
1. In January, consumer prices were up by 1.68% and annual inflation rose by 0.37 points to 14.97%. The rise in inflation was mainly driven by core goods and energy groups. While annual inflation in services slightly decreased, the fall in food annual inflation was led by fresh fruits and vegetables. Against this background, annual inflation rates and trends of B and C indices increased. 
2. Although prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 2.48% in January, annual inflation in the group decreased by 2.50 points to 18.11%. While processed food inflation increased by 2.59 points to 18.11%, unprocessed food inflation decreased by 8.26% to 18.08% also due to the base effect. The significant drop in seasonally adjusted vegetable prices became the key driver of the marked fall in unprocessed food prices. Unlike the favorable outlook in fresh fruits and vegetables prices, the rapid rise in other unprocessed food prices continued. Following the adjustment in the reference raw milk price, milk prices significantly increased (14.52%), while the rise in meat prices was another prominent development. Processed food prices increased by 3.75% in January, led by cheese, other dairy products and fats and oils. The rise in the reference raw milk price widely affected related food products and leading indicators point that this trend, although slowing down, continues in February. Despite the appreciation in the Turkish lira, developments in international commodity prices continued to affect processed food prices adversely, particularly those of fats and oils. As a result, annual food inflation excluding fresh fruits and vegetables rose to 19.89%.   
3. In January, energy prices increased by 3.24% and annual inflation in the energy group reached 7.86%, driven by adjustments in administered prices. The rise was led by price increases in electricity (6.18%), municipal water (7.15%) and natural gas (1.09%) prices. Despite the rise in international crude oil prices, the rise in fuel oil prices remained limited (0.65%) thanks to the appreciation in the Turkish lira and the sliding scale system. The Committee noted that annual inflation in the energy group, which significantly decreased in February-April period last year, would continue to increase in the upcoming months due to the base effect, despite the limiting effect of the sliding scale system. 
4. In January, core goods prices was up 0.47% and annual inflation in the core goods group increased by 2.94 points to 20.18%. The cumulative exchange rate effects and demand conditions as well as the minimum wage developments, international commodity prices and supply constraints continued to affect durable goods inflation. In this period, while price increases in automobiles and electrical and non-electrical equipment decelerated, furniture prices posted a high increase of 6.31%. Other core goods prices, which are affected by the lagged effects of exchange rate developments, increased by 2.03%. Seasonal sales in clothing and footwear, groups limiting consumer inflation, remained more limited compared to the previous year and annual inflation in the group increased. Leading indicators suggest that a partial decline has started in cumulative exchange rate effects on the core goods inflation trend.  Yet, the Committee highlighted the upside risks to clothing inflation that was contained by pandemic-led weak demand conditions.
5. In January, services prices rose by 1.87%, while annual services inflation decreased by 0.14 points to 11.52%.  Annual inflation increased in rents, restaurants-hotels and communication groups, while posting a more significant rise in the transport group, and decreased in other services. The rise in transport services was mainly driven by the adjustments in intra-city transportation fees. The rise in annual inflation in restaurants-hotels was mainly driven by catering services, and the increases in food prices and the minimum wage were influential in this development.  Excluding communication, the trend of the services inflation remained high. The Committee has reiterated that pandemic-led dynamics have contained the services inflation, particularly inflation in accommodation, package tours, education, transport, recreational and cultural services, and underlined the upside risks associated with the normalization process. Moreover, it was noted that the special communication tax, which was raised from 7.5% to 10%, had an upside effect on services inflation, as confirmed by leading indicators.
6. Inflation expectations decreased in January and also in February, however remained at elevated levels. In CBRT Survey of Expectations the 12-month-ahead inflation expectation decreased by 0.17 points to 10.36% and 24 month-ahead inflation expectation decreased by 0.11 points to 9.03%.
7. The Committee evaluated the impact of the change in the weights in consumer prices index on the forecast path presented in the January Inflation Report. It was noted that the rise in the weights of groups with high annual inflation would make an upside impact on annual inflation until mid-2021. The impact of the weight on annual inflation was projected to reach 0.5 points by April, then post a gradual decline in the rest of the year and die out towards the end of the year. 
Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks
8. Global economic activity data indicate that the partial recovery since the third quarter continues, albeit with some deceleration. However, despite ongoing vaccination efforts, risks to the global economic activity prevail due to uncertainties pertaining to the vaccination process and the course of the pandemic. The effects of pandemic-related restrictions in European countries are more prevalent on the services sector, while manufacturing industry remains strong. 
9. Advanced and emerging economies maintain their expansionary monetary and fiscal stances. Despite the recent rise, long-term interest rates in advanced economies are still at historically low levels. Even though central banks announce in their statements that inflation is likely to increase temporarily in the post-pandemic normalization process, the forward guidance delivered and market expectations point that the low interest environment would continue for an extended period in advanced economies. The effectiveness of these policies on financial markets, growth and employment will depend on the course of the pandemic and the available policy room in each country.
10. Similar to the previous MPC meeting period, emerging economy portfolio markets continued to attract large volume of inflows due to improved risk sentiment. In this period, the trend of inflows to bond markets of emerging economies remained the same as the previous MPC meeting, while inflows to equity markets continued increasingly.
11. Crude oil prices have been rapidly increasing since the last MPC meeting. In addition, the ongoing rise in commodity prices excluding energy, specifically agricultural commodities and industrial metals, have an adverse effect on both producer and consumer inflation. Inflation is quite high in paper products and basic metals sectors, which are main input providers for the manufacturing industry. Supply constraints have become more pronounced as delivery times lengthened in those and related sectors. Other items driving producer inflation higher include vegetable oils, animal feed, processed steel products, vehicles and electronic products. These items affect consumer inflation through food and durable goods. The Committee stated that in the upcoming months, consumer inflation would increase consistent with the past projections due to the base effect of import prices and the rise would be mainly driven by the energy group. The Committee noted the important role of commodity prices in continuing inflationary pressures despite the appreciation in the Turkish lira, and reiterated the upside risks for the upcoming months.
12. Economic activity is on a strong course. In December, the industrial production index increased by 1.3% month-on-month and 12.1% year-on-year. Thus, production gained strength, having grown by 4.8% in the fourth quarter from the third quarter. While turnover and retail trade volume indices also strengthened compared to the third quarter, economic activity was considerably buoyant in services excluding tourism-related sectors as well as in trade. Hence, pre-pandemic levels were exceeded widely across sectors excluding industrial and services sector groups that were adversely affected by the pandemic.
13. The strong course of economic activity is also reflected onto the labor market.. In November period, seasonally adjusted nonfarm employment increased by 0.2% from the previous period, while total and nonfarm unemployment rates were 12.9% and 14.9%, respectively. During this period, employment was up in the industrial sector amid supported by upward trend in exports, but edged down in construction and services. The fall in services employment was driven by the sectors that have been hit hardest by the pandemic.
14. While the downward effects of the pandemic-related restrictions on the economy have been limited, the slowdown in activity in services and related sectors and uncertainties surrounding the short-run outlook of these sectors prevail. Survey indicators for February indicated that manufacturing industry activity remains strong, particularly in intermediate and durable goods sectors. While there is no additional slowdown in domestic demand, there is some weakening in external demand mainly due to lockdown restrictions in Europe. Domestic demand faces upside risks associated with the timing of lifting pandemic-related restrictions. The Committee assessed that the inflationary effects of the sectoral divergences that emerged due to pandemic dynamics and the macro policy mix, along with the risks they imply for the period ahead should be monitored.
15. Evaluating the output gap indicators related to the cyclical state of the economy, the Committee concluded that economic activity started converging to its underlying trend due to some slowdown in the first quarter, but demand-side inflationary effects continue to exist throughout the quarter. Business and household surveys indicate that the demand for durable goods has been strong. Some members of the Committee underlined that personal loan demand is still brisk due to high inflation expectations, and reiterated that the effects of the monetary policy tightening are yet to be felt.  To this end, developments in credit growth and its composition will be monitored closely.
16. The strengthening domestic demand, due to the cumulative effects of high credit growth during the pandemic, continues to have an adverse effect on the current account balance. In addition, rising international prices for oil and other commodities also affect the external balance. Gold imports have declined to their historical averages since mid-January. The Committee assessed that terms of trade-related risks to the current account balance may be limited if that trend in gold imports hints at a permanent improvement. 
17. Credit growth has started to slow down amid tighter financial conditions. The limiting effect of the slowdown in loans on domestic demand and imports is expected to be more pronounced in the upcoming period. The Committee underscored once again the importance of the course of the current account balance in terms of a lasting recovery in economic activity and financial stability.
Monetary Policy 
18. The Committee re-emphasized that monetary policy decisions will be taken within the framework of inflation targeting regime and with the priority of price stability. The monetary policy stance will be set taking into account the upside risks to the inflation outlook and with a focus on bringing inflation down permanently in a cautious manner and achieving price stability target.
19. Domestic demand conditions, cumulative cost effects, in particular the exchange rate effects, increasing international food and other commodity prices and high levels of inflation expectations continue to affect the pricing behavior and inflation outlook adversely. The decelerating impact of the strong monetary tightening on credit and domestic demand is expected to become more significant; hence the effects of demand and cost factors on inflation are envisaged to wane gradually.
20. On the other hand, the ongoing upward trend in international commodity prices, supply constraints intensifying in some sectors, and the adjustments in wage and administered prices maintain their importance for the medium-term inflation outlook. The tight monetary stance will serve as a significant buffer against external and temporary volatilities in the context of inflation expectations, pricing behavior and financial market developments.
21. Accordingly, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained decisively, taking into account the end-2021 forecast target, for an extended period until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and price stability. In regard to the indicators pointing to a permanent fall in inflation and price stability, indicators for the underlying trend of inflation and pricing behavior, diffusion indices, demand and cost factors, and inflation expectations are monitored closely for their compatibility with the targets in the forecast horizon. The interaction of risks posed by soaring commodity prices to the inflation outlook with the pricing behavior and inflation expectations will be closely monitored. In addition, there has been recently an acceleration in consumer loans. Additional monetary tightening will be delivered if needed. 
22. The balance between the monetary policy rate and actual/expected inflation will be sustained decisively to maintain a strong disinflationary effect until permanent price stability and the 5% target are reached. Sustaining the tight monetary policy stance in such a manner, besides attaining permanent price stability, will foster macroeconomic and financial stability positively by facilitating the fall in country risk premium, the reversal in currency substitution, the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and the perpetual decline in financing costs.
23. The effects of the monetary policy stance on money markets have been examined. There has been some decline in loan and deposit rates, recently. The Committee stated that Turkish lira reserve requirements need to be increased in order to enhance the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism. For the same purpose, the Committee discussed whether to lower the rates within the Reserve Options Mechanism, which allows a certain ratio of Turkish lira required reserves to be maintained in foreign currency and gold. The Committee emphasized that the policy rate is the sole instrument to determine the monetary policy stance, while the required reserve ratio is a tool that affects the transmission of the monetary stance determined by the policy rate to deposit, loan and other money markets.
24. The Committee reiterated its judgement that in order to achieve price stability, a strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders are required.
25. In its decision-making process, the CBRT adopts a framework with a medium term perspective, based on analyzing all factors affecting inflation and the interaction between these factors.
26. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance."

Press Release on Interest Rates
Participating Committee Members
Naci Ağbal (Governor), Murat Çetinkaya, Ömer Duman, Uğur Namık Küçük, Oğuzhan Özbaş, Emrah Şener, Abdullah Yavaş.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to increase the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 17 percent to 19 percent.
Global growth outlook has improved and international commodity prices have risen on the back of expansionary monetary and fiscal policies as well as positive developments in the vaccination process. Rising global inflation expectations lead to uncertainties about advanced economy monetary policies, and volatility in global financial markets.
Economic activity is on a strong course. As the pandemic-related restrictions are being eased, economic activity is expected to pick up in services and related sectors. Nevertheless, risks for economic activity remain significant depending on possible developments regarding the course of the pandemic. Strong domestic demand due to the cumulative effects of high credit growth during the pandemic and the rise in import prices continue to adversely affect the current account balance. On the other hand, credit growth, which has slowed down amid tighter financial conditions, has recently trended upwards.
Domestic demand conditions, cumulative cost effects, in particular the exchange rate effects, increasing international food and other commodity prices and high levels of inflation expectations continue to affect the pricing behavior and inflation outlook adversely. On the other hand, supply constraints intensifying in some sectors and the adjustments in wages and administered prices maintain their importance for the medium-term inflation outlook. While the expectation that the decelerating impact of the monetary tightening on credit and domestic demand to become more significant is maintained, the projected gradual waning in demand and cost factors is being delayed by the recent upward trend in credit growth and increase in import costs.
Considering the upside risks to inflation expectations, pricing behavior and the medium-term inflation outlook associated with these developments, the MPC has decided to implement a front-loaded and strong additional monetary tightening.
The tight monetary policy stance will be maintained decisively, taking into account the end-2021 forecast target, for an extended period until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and price stability. In regard to the indicators pointing to a permanent fall in inflation and price stability, indicators for the underlying trend of inflation and pricing behavior, diffusion indices, demand and cost factors, and inflation expectations will continue to be monitored closely for their compatibility with the targets in the forecast horizon. Additional monetary tightening will be delivered if needed.
The balance between the monetary policy rate and actual/expected inflation will be sustained decisively to maintain a strong disinflationary effect until permanent price stability and the 5 percent target are reached. Sustaining the tight monetary policy stance in such a manner, besides attaining permanent price stability, will foster macroeconomic and financial stability positively by facilitating the fall in country risk premium, the reversal in currency substitution, the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and the perpetual decline in financing costs.
In its decision-making process, the CBRT adopts a framework with a medium term perspective, based on analyzing all factors affecting inflation and the interaction between these factors. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.

2021,25 March 2021,Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting,"No: 2021-14
25 March 2021
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 18 March 2021
Inflation Developments
1. In February, consumer prices increased by 0.91% and annual inflation rose by 0.64 points to 15.61%. While the increase in annual inflation was spread across all sub-groups, the most significant contribution came from core goods and energy groups. Under this outlook, while annual inflation rates of B and C indices continued to increase, their trends declined somewhat.
2. Prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 2.57% in February, and the group’s annual inflation increased by 0.29 points to 18.40%. While this rise was mainly driven by the 19.72% increase in processed food prices, unprocessed food inflation decreased by 1.07 points to 17.01%. In this period, inflation in fresh fruits and vegetables decreased slightly, while in other unprocessed food group, meat prices continued to increase and the lagged impact of the adjustment in the reference raw milk price continued to be observed in milk prices. When leading indicators for March are taken into account, it is observed that the rise in the reference raw milk price in January had a significant impact on consumer inflation throughout the first quarter. Processed food prices maintained their rapid uptrend and increased by 2.27% month-on-month. In tandem with the related items in the unprocessed food group, prices of processed meat products, cheese and other dairy products increased as well. Meanwhile, with the impact of developments in international markets, the high rate of increases in fats and oils continued. With these developments, the annual food inflation excluding fresh fruits and vegetables reached 20.75%. Leading indicators signal that annual food inflation may slow down led by unprocessed food prices.
3. In February, energy prices increased by 0.25% and annual inflation in the energy group was 8.82%. During this period, natural gas and municipal water prices increased by 0.80% and 0.59%, respectively. Despite the rise in international crude oil prices, the rise in fuel oil prices remained limited at 0.16% due to the appreciation in the Turkish lira and the active use of the sliding scale system. The uptrend in oil prices continued in March, however, the sliding scale system curbed the effects coming through this channel. As per the EPDK decision of 17 March 2021, a price cap practice was introduced for every province for a period of 2 months and fuel oil prices decreased thereafter. Despite the curbing effect of the sliding scale system, the Committee has noted that the annual energy group inflation will significantly increase in the next two months due to the low base in the previous year. 
4. In February, core goods prices decreased by 0.12% and the group’s annual inflation in the increased by 1.52 points to 21.70%. While annual inflation increased in clothing, footwear and durables goods, it remained flat in other core goods. Annual inflation in the clothing and footwear group rose significantly as seasonal discount rates in the clothing and footwear prices were low this year. Annual inflation in durable goods had been hovering high due to the rise in the international commodity prices, supply constraints and strong domestic demand; nevertheless, durable goods inflation decelerated on the back of easing cumulative exchange rate effects. While prices in other core goods decreased by 0.19%, annual inflation remained flat. Medicine prices, which increased by 6.09% on a monthly basis due to the reference price practice, prevented a more favorable outlook in this group. It is anticipated that the portion of the increase in medicine prices that were extended to March will be higher and will continue to affect other core goods inflation adversely. The Committee maintained its emphasis on the upside risks to clothing inflation that was curbed by weak demand conditions due to the pandemic. 
5. Services prices were up 1.04% in February and the group’s annual inflation increased by 0.22 points to 11.74%. Annual inflation increased in communication services and restaurants-hotels; remained flat in rents and other services, and decreased in transport services. While the regulation in the special communication tax was the determining factor in the increase in annual inflation in communication services, it is observed that its impact continued in March as well. While the catering services item stood out in the increase in the annual restaurants-hotels inflation, the rise in food prices and the minimum wage is considered to be effective in this development. Meanwhile, other services group prices continued to display different trends across its sub-items. Annual inflation in health and repair-maintenance items remained high, while that in package tours, recreational and cultural services and education activities, adversely affected by the pandemic, maintained its moderate course. However, the Committee drew attention to the upward impact of the controlled normalization process on some service prices in the light of leading indicators. The Committee also noted that the accumulated costs during pandemic lockdowns as well as capacity-limiting measures may lead to unit cost-driven inflationary effects in certain sectors, particularly in the restaurants-hotels groups. 
6. Inflation expectations increased in March. The 12-month-ahead inflation expectation increased by 0.11 points to 10.47% and 24 month-ahead inflation expectation increased by 0.15 points to 9.18%. In this period, inflation compensations derived from bond yields increased as well. The Committee underlined that this course of inflation expectations increased the risks to pricing behavior and the medium-term inflation outlook. 
Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks
7. Global growth outlook has improved and international commodity prices have risen on the back of expansionary monetary and fiscal policies as well as positive developments in the vaccination process. However, despite ongoing vaccination efforts, risks to the global economic activity prevail due to uncertainties pertaining to the vaccination process and the course of the pandemic. The effects of pandemic-related restrictions in European countries are more prevalent on the services sector, while manufacturing industry remains strong.
8. In tandem with the recovery in expectations of growth in advanced economies, rising global inflation expectations and long-term bond rates lead to uncertainties about advanced economy monetary policies, and volatility in global financial markets. Even though central banks announce in their statements that inflation is likely to increase temporarily in the post-pandemic normalization process, the forward guidance delivered points that the low interest environment would continue for an extended period in advanced economies. Nevertheless, the Committee noted that global inflationary pressures might cause an earlier-than-projected tightening in monetary policies; it is assessed that a period marked by increased data-sensitivity and related volatilities in global financial markets is entered.
9. Since the last MPC meeting, portfolio flows to emerging economies continued, albeit at a slower rate. In this period, bond markets of emerging economies saw outflows, while inflows to equity markets accelerated. Portfolio flows to emerging economies may be adversely affected if the uptrend in long-term bond rates in advanced economies continues. 
10. Crude oil and industrial metal prices continue to rise. The sliding scale system limits the negative effects of crude oil prices. Although agricultural commodity prices are somewhat more moderate, prices of certain products, oils in particular, remain on the rise. High producer inflation and ongoing problems in supply chains are additional pressure factors. Despite the partial appreciation in the Turkish lira in February, producer prices continued to soar in input supplying industries such as petroleum, chemical products, food, wood and cork, non-metallic minerals and paper. The Committee assessed that upside risks to the year-end forecast target announced in the January Inflation Report rose significantly due to an increased credit impulse, especially since the end of January, and rising import costs.
11. Economic activity is on a strong course. In the last quarter of 2020, GDP grew by 5.9% year-on-year and 1.7% quarter-on-quarter. While private consumption demand maintained its strong course spreading across all goods and services, public consumption continued to support domestic demand. Despite the sharp increase in machinery and equipment investments, investment expenditures weighed on growth as construction investments fell markedly. The Committee noted that, excluding construction, domestic demand exhibited a quite strong momentum, as envisaged, and maintained its assessment that aggregate demand conditions were at inflationary levels in the last quarter of 2020.
12. Economic activity displays a strong quarterly momentum in the first quarter as well and being higher than projected, remains above its long-term trend. In January, the industrial production index increased by 1.0% month-on-month and 2.3% quarter-on-quarter. Intermediate and durable consumer goods continued to be the drivers of the increase in industrial production. Turnovers increased in trade and construction in January, but remained almost flat in services due to the weak course in sectors that are directly affected by the pandemic. As the pandemic-related restrictions are being eased, economic activity is expected to pick up in services and related sectors. In fact, high-frequency data indicate that economic activity has gained strength amid credit developments and controlled normalization. Nevertheless, risks for economic activity remain significant depending on possible developments regarding the course of the pandemic.
13. The strong course of economic activity is also reflected onto the labor market. In January, seasonally adjusted nonfarm employment increased by 2.1% from the previous month, while total and nonfarm unemployment rates were 12.2% and 14.2%, respectively. During this period, employment increased in the services sector, but remained almost flat in industry and construction sectors.
14. The data released for the first quarter point to a stronger course compared to the outlook presented in the January Inflation Report regarding economic activity and the cyclical state of the economy. The Committee assessed that the underlying trend in economic activity is quite strong, considering the limiting effect of the pandemic-related restrictions. Business and household surveys indicate that the demand for durable goods is still higher than long-term averages. Some members of the Committee reiterated that personal loan demand is still brisk due to high inflation expectations.  
15. Strong domestic demand due to the cumulative effects of high credit growth during the pandemic and the rise in import prices continue to adversely affect the current account balance. High-frequency data point to an increase in exports and imports, while the developments in terms of trade have a more pronounced impact on the foreign trade deficit. Meanwhile, gold imports have declined to their historical averages since mid-January. The Committee assessed that terms of trade-related risks to the current account balance may be limited if that trend in gold imports hints at a permanent improvement.
16. Credit growth, which has slowed down amid tighter financial conditions, has recently trended upwards. Despite this uptick in personal and commercial loans, the limiting effect of the slowdown in loans on domestic demand and imports is expected to be more pronounced in the upcoming period with the additional monetary tightening. The Committee underscored once again the importance of the course of the current account balance in terms of a lasting recovery in economic activity and financial stability.
Monetary Policy 
17. The Committee re-emphasized that monetary policy decisions will be taken within the framework of inflation targeting regime and with the priority of price stability. The monetary policy stance will be set taking into account the upside risks to the inflation outlook and with a focus on bringing inflation down permanently in a cautious manner and achieving price stability target.
18. Domestic demand conditions, cumulative cost effects, in particular the exchange rate effects, increasing international food and other commodity prices and high levels of inflation expectations continue to affect the pricing behavior and inflation outlook adversely. On the other hand, supply constraints intensifying in some sectors and the adjustments in wages and administered prices maintain their importance for the medium-term inflation outlook. While the expectation that the decelerating impact of the monetary tightening on credit and domestic demand to become more significant is maintained, the projected gradual waning in demand and cost factors is being delayed by the recent upward trend in credit growth and increase in import costs.
19. As a result of pandemic-driven expansionary policies, inflation expectations have been increasing recently in the United States, causing long-term bond yields to rise, and thus the global risk appetite to follow a volatile course and emerging market currencies to depreciate. The tight monetary stance will serve as a significant buffer against external and temporary volatilities in the context of inflation expectations, pricing behavior and financial market developments.
20. Considering the upside risks to inflation expectations, pricing behavior and the medium-term inflation outlook associated with these developments, the MPC has decided to implement a front-loaded and strong additional monetary tightening.
21. The tight monetary policy stance will be maintained decisively, taking into account the end-2021 forecast target, for an extended period until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and price stability. In regard to the indicators pointing to a permanent fall in inflation and price stability, indicators for the underlying trend of inflation and pricing behavior, diffusion indices, demand and cost factors, and inflation expectations will continue to be monitored closely for their compatibility with the targets in the forecast horizon. The interaction of the risks on the inflation outlook caused by the recent acceleration in loans, the increasing volatility in financial markets due to rising global inflation expectations, and the increase in international commodity prices with the pricing behavior and inflation expectations will be closely monitored. Additional monetary tightening will be delivered if needed. 
22. The balance between the monetary policy rate and actual/expected inflation will be sustained decisively to maintain a strong disinflationary effect until permanent price stability and the 5 percent target are reached. Sustaining the tight monetary policy stance in such a manner, besides attaining permanent price stability, will foster macroeconomic and financial stability positively by facilitating the fall in country risk premium, the reversal in currency substitution, the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and the perpetual decline in financing costs. 
23. Demand and cost-side effects remain significant for inflation given credit market and economic activity indicators, as well as exchange rate volatility and developments in import prices. The outlook for domestic demand, international prices and global risk appetite heightens the risks arising from external financing needs to the balance of payments. In formulating the monetary policy towards the target of price stability, the Committee will continue to follow an approach that also addresses the risks to financial stability.
24. The Committee reiterated its judgement that in order to achieve price stability, a strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders are required.
25. In its decision-making process, the CBRT adopts a framework with a medium term perspective, based on analyzing all factors affecting inflation and the interaction between these factors. 
26. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance."

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 19 percent.
The global economy, having contracted sharply in 2020 due to the pandemic, continues to recover on the back of accommodative policies and positive developments in the vaccination process. This improvement process is determined especially by the acceleration in manufacturing industry activity and global trade. While the upward trend in commodity prices has decelerated, the effects of the rising global inflation expectations on international financial markets remain significant.
Despite the constraining effect of the pandemic, domestic economic activity is strong, led by domestic and external demand. Manufacturing industry activity exhibits a strong momentum, whereas the weak course continues in the services sector, which has been adversely affected by the pandemic restrictions. Nevertheless, risks for economic activity exist in either direction depending on the progress of the pandemic and the vaccination process. Notwithstanding the rise in exports and the fall in gold imports, strong domestic demand and commodity prices continue to adversely affect the current account balance. While commercial loans exhibit a moderate course, an upward trend is observed in consumer loan growth despite tightening financial conditions.
Demand and cost factors, supply constraints in some sectors, and high levels of inflation expectations continue to pose risks to the pricing behavior and inflation outlook. The decelerating impact of the current monetary stance on credit and domestic demand is envisaged to become more significant in the upcoming period. Accordingly, the MPC has decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance by keeping the policy rate unchanged.
The CBRT will continue to use decisively all available instruments in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. The policy rate will continue to be determined at a level above inflation to maintain a strong disinflationary effect until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is reached.
The stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability positively through the fall in country risk premium, reversal in currency substitution, accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and perpetual decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.
The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

Press Release on Payments Area




Studies on the regulation regarding the disuse of crypto assets in payments have been completed.




Crypto assets entail significant risks to the relevant parties due to the following reasons:

they are neither subject to any regulation and supervision mechanisms nor a central regulatory authority,
their market values can be excessively volatile,
they may be used in illegal actions due to their anonymous structures,
wallets can be stolen or used unlawfully without the authorization of their holders, and
transactions are irrevocable.

Recently, some initiatives have emerged regarding the use of these assets in payments. It is considered that their use in payments may cause non-recoverable losses for the parties to the transactions due to the above-listed factors and they include elements that may undermine the confidence in methods and instruments used currently in payments.
Accordingly, pursuant to the authority vested by the Law No:1211 on the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) and the Law No. 6493 on Payment and Securities Settlement Systems, Payment Services and Electronic Money Institutions, the CBRT has introduced “Regulation on the Disuse of Crypto Assets in Payments”.

2021,22 April 2021,Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting,"No: 2021-18
22 April 2021
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 15 April 2021
Inflation Developments
1. Consumer prices rose by 1.08% in March, and annual inflation increased by 0.58 points to 16.19%. Annual inflation increased in energy, services and core goods groups, but declined in the food group. Against this background, annual inflation rates of B and C indices increased, and their trends remained high despite some decline.
2. Prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 1.13% in March, and the group's annual inflation fell by 0.96 points to 17.44%. While this was largely due to annual unprocessed food inflation declining to 14.98%, annual processed food inflation rose slightly to 19.87%. The decline in annual unprocessed food inflation was led by the recently mild course of fresh fruit and vegetable prices. Seasonally adjusted data indicate that fruit and vegetable prices fell in March, while the increase in other unprocessed food prices slowed. After upswings in January and February, processed food prices continued to rise in March, albeit at a slower rate. International oil prices continued to rise, and domestic prices of fats and oils continued to climb, although at a slowing pace. Prices of international agricultural commodities, which have been on the rise for a long time, have recently displayed a more moderate outlook. Leading indicators suggest that annual food inflation continued to fall in the first half of April. 
3. Rising by only 0.09%, energy prices remained largely unchanged in March, but the group's annual inflation rose by 3.61 points to 12.43% due to the base effect. Bottled gas and natural gas prices increased by 2.81% and 0.93%, respectively, in March, while fuel prices fell by 0.69%. Despite the rise in international crude oil prices and exchange rate developments, their impact on fuel prices was prevented by the sliding scale system and the price cap practice that helps this system to be more effective. Currently, the sliding scale system eliminates an important inflationary effect given the direct and indirect effects of fuel prices. The upward trend in annual energy inflation is expected to continue in April due to the base effect.
4. Core goods prices rose by 1.39% in March, and the group's annual inflation rose by 0.44 points to 22.14%. Annual inflation increased in clothing and footwear and other core goods, but declined slightly in durable goods. Across other core goods, prices were notably higher in household repair-maintenance and personal care products with high exchange rate pass-through in addition to the lingering effect of adjustments to prices of medicine. Durable goods prices had a limited increase in March due to supply constraints and rising international industrial metal prices. Furniture and automobile prices rose in this period, while prices of electrical and non-electrical appliances decreased, easing the rise in the group’s prices.
5. Prices of services increased by 1.26% in March, and the group's annual inflation rose by 0.82 points to 12.56%. Annual inflation increased in restaurants-hotels, communication and other services, but followed a flat course in rents and transport services. With the easing of pandemic measures, restaurants-hotels prices increased significantly in March. Cost increases during the period when activities were interrupted passed through to prices, while the increasing demand, triggered by capacity constraints, was another factor that put pressure on prices. Prices of communication services rose amid the lingering effects of the increases in the special communication tax. Among items grouped within other services, education and recreation services diverged negatively due to sharp price increases. The increase in prices of recreation services was driven by the easing of pandemic measures. On the other hand, prices of education services increased on the back of the backward indexation in private school tuitions as well as the expiration of temporary VAT reductions.
6. According to the results of the CBRT Survey of Expectations, participants’ inflation expectations have increased in April. While the current year-end inflation expectation increased by 1.58 points to 13.12% in April, the 12-month ahead and 24-month ahead inflation expectations rose by 0.79 points and 0.37 points to 11.26% and 9.55%, respectively. 
Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks
7. The global economy, having contracted sharply in 2020 due to the pandemic, continues to recover on the back of accommodative policies and positive developments in the vaccination process. This improvement process is determined especially by the acceleration in manufacturing industry activity and global trade. However, despite ongoing vaccination efforts, risks to the global economic activity prevail due to uncertainties pertaining to the course of the pandemic. In this period, the upward trend in commodity prices has decelerated.
8. In tandem with the recovery in expectations of growth in advanced economies, the effects of the rising global inflation expectations on international financial markets remain significant. Long-term bond rates lead to uncertainties about advanced economy monetary policies, and volatility in global financial markets. Nevertheless, the Committee maintained its assessment that global inflationary pressures might cause an earlier-than-projected tightening in monetary policies, and maintained its assessment that a period marked by increased data-sensitivity and related volatilities in global financial markets was entered.
9. Since the last MPC meeting, portfolio flows to emerging economies have continued at an accelerated rate in bond markets and at a milder pace in equity markets. The volatility in long-term bond rates in advanced economies keeps the risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies alive. 
10. Driven also by the exchange rate developments, producer prices posted a strong widespread increase in March. Commodity prices have registered some deceleration in the recent period. However, inflationary effects arising from disruptions in supply chains persist.
11. While commercial loans exhibit a moderate course, an upward trend is observed in consumer loan growth despite tightening financial conditions. Noting that demand and cost-side inflationary effects persisted, the Committee maintained its assessment that the risks to the year-end forecast target announced in the January Inflation Report were on the upside.
12. Despite the constraining effect of the pandemic, domestic economic activity is strong, led by domestic and external demand. In January-February period, industrial production rose by 2.3% compared to the previous quarter, and continued to hover above its long-term trend despite the constraining effect of the pandemic in this period. The strong momentum in manufacturing industry activity has widely spread across sectors, being particularly significant in intermediate and durable consumer goods. On the other hand, the weak course continues in the services sector, which has been adversely affected by the pandemic restrictions.
13. In February, nonfarm employment remained flat while total and nonfarm unemployment rates rose by 0.7 points to 13.4% and 15.3%, respectively, due to the increase in the participation rate. During this period, employment increased in the services and construction sectors, but decreased in the industry sector.
14. Regarding the cyclical state of the economy, the data released for the first quarter indicate that economic activity remains above the potential and aggregate demand conditions continue to be at inflationary levels. While high-frequency data indicate that economic activity remains strong amid credit developments and controlled normalization, risks for economic activity exist in either direction depending on the progress of the pandemic and the vaccination process in the period ahead.
15. Notwithstanding the rise in exports and the fall in gold imports, strong domestic demand and commodity prices continue to adversely affect the current account balance. Provisional data suggest that imports increased in real terms along with price increases in March. Gold imports, which started decelerating in the second half of January, have declined even below their historical averages in the recent period. This trend in gold imports limits the adverse effect of the terms of trade on the current account balance. Meanwhile, exports to both European and non-European countries are on the rise. Current trends indicate that the annualized current account balance will start to improve in the second quarter of this year. The Committee noted that tightened pandemic restrictions in some trading partners and supply problems in certain sectors, the automotive sector in particular, may constitute downside risk factors for the current account balance. The Committee underscored once again the importance of the course of the current account balance in terms of a lasting recovery in economic activity and financial stability. 
Monetary Policy
16. The monetary policy stance will be set taking into account the upside risks to the inflation outlook and with a focus on bringing inflation down permanently in a cautious manner and achieving the price stability target. Accordingly, the policy stance will continue to be determined by taking into account inflation developments and inflation expectations, and at a degree of tightness that will restore the disinflation process as soon as possible and ensure its sustainability until the medium-term targets are achieved.
17. Demand and cost factors, supply constraints in some sectors, and high levels of inflation expectations continue to pose risks to the pricing behavior and inflation outlook. The decelerating impact of the current monetary stance on credit and domestic demand is envisaged to become more significant in the upcoming period. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance by keeping the policy rate unchanged at 19%.
18. The tight monetary stance will serve as a significant buffer against external and temporary volatilities in the context of inflation expectations, pricing behavior and financial market developments.
19. The CBRT will continue to use decisively all available instruments in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. The policy rate will continue to be determined at a level above inflation to maintain a strong disinflationary effect until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5% target is reached.
20. The stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, reversal in currency substitution, accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and perpetual decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.
21. Demand and cost-side effects remain significant for inflation given credit market and economic activity indicators, as well as exchange rate volatility and developments in import prices. The outlook for domestic demand, international prices and global risk appetite heightens the risks arising from external financing needs to the balance of payments. In formulating the monetary policy towards the target of price stability, the Committee will continue to follow an approach that also addresses the risks to financial stability.
22. The Committee reiterated its judgement that in order to achieve price stability, a strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders are required.
23. The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework."

The global economy, having contracted sharply in 2020 due to the pandemic, continues to recover on the back of accommodative policies and positive developments in the vaccination process. This improvement process is determined especially by the acceleration in manufacturing industry activity and global trade. While commodity prices have increased again in the recent period, the effects of the rising global inflation expectations on international financial markets remain significant.
Despite the constraining effect of the pandemic, domestic economic activity is strong. While domestic demand has slightly decelerated due to pandemic restrictions, external demand remains strong. Manufacturing industry activity exhibits a strong momentum, whereas the weak course continues in the services sector, which has been adversely affected by the pandemic restrictions. Nevertheless, risks for economic activity exist in either direction depending on the progress of the pandemic and the vaccination process. Consumer loans, along with commercial loans, exhibit a milder course, and the durability of this development is monitored for macroeconomic stability. Despite the rise in commodity prices, the strong upward trend in exports, the significant fall in gold imports and the slowdown in credit amid the tightening of financial conditions support the expected improvement in the current account balance.
Demand and cost factors, supply constraints in some sectors, and high levels of inflation expectations continue to pose risks to the pricing behavior and inflation outlook. The decelerating impact of the monetary tightening on credit and domestic demand has begun to be observed. Taking into account the high levels of inflation and inflation expectations, the current monetary policy stance will be maintained until the significant fall in the April Inflation Report’s forecast path is achieved. Accordingly, the MPC has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged.

2021,11 May 2021,Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting,"No: 2021-22
11 May 2021
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 6 May 2021,
Inflation Developments
1. Consumer prices were up by 1.68% in April, and annual inflation increased by 0.95 points to 17.14%. While annual inflation rose in energy, core goods, and services groups, it declined in the food group. The uptrend in commodity prices continued in this period, and inflation was affected by the recent exchange rate developments. Against this background, annual inflation rates of B and C indices increased, and their trends remained high despite some improvement.
2. In April, prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 2.13% but the group’s annual inflation dropped by 0.46 points to 16.98%. Annual inflation edged down by 0.31 points to 14.67% in the unprocessed food group, and by 0.51 points to 19.36% in the processed food group. Seasonally-adjusted data for unprocessed food suggest a rise in prices driven by fresh fruits and vegetables. This was mainly led by the strong increase in vegetable prices due to season transition. Although red and white meat items diverged unfavorably, price increases in other unprocessed food were more moderate. The high base in this group was the main factor bringing annual unprocessed food inflation down. While processed food prices rose by 0.97% month-on-month, international prices continued to affect the prices of fats and oils. It is judged that international agricultural commodity prices, which resumed the uptrend in April, will continue to affect food inflation. 
3. While energy prices remained almost flat with only a 0.10% increase in April, annual energy inflation surged by 6.01 points to 18.44%. In April, prices of bottled gas and natural gas increased by 1.64% and 1.07%, respectively, whereas fuel prices were down by 0.78%. In this period of relatively flat international crude oil prices, fuel prices dropped on the back of the sliding-scale system and the price cap practice that increased the system’s effectiveness. However, annual energy inflation increased significantly in April due to the pandemic-led low base from the previous year. 
4. Annual core goods inflation stood at 23.13% in April. Annual inflation decreased in durable goods but rose in clothing-footwear and other core goods. Durable goods registered exchange rate-driven price increases, mainly led by automobile prices, while the decline in furniture prices had a curbing effect. The upward trend in clothing and footwear prices has persisted since the beginning of the year, and annual inflation climbed by 3.63 points to 10.96% in April with the arrival of the new season. Exchange rate effects were visible in the other core goods group, and the group’s annual inflation rose by 2.01 points to 18.81%. 
5. In April, services prices increased by 0.72%, and annual services inflation rose by 0.56 points to 13.12. While the rise in annual inflation was more pronounced in restaurants-hotels and other services groups, more limited increases were observed in other subgroups. Annual inflation in restaurants-hotels increased significantly due also to the low base stemming from the lockdown of last year, while monthly price hikes proved notable both in catering and accommodation services. Price increases in other services were triggered by education services as well as by items such as maintenance-repair of personal transport equipment and dental services that are highly sensitive to exchange rate developments. The rise in private primary and secondary school tuition was mainly driven by the backward indexation behavior and the expiration of temporary VAT reductions. The Committee noted that there might be a temporary fluctuation in services inflation due to the lockdown in May and the possible re-opening in the subsequent period.
6. Inflation expectations continued to increase in May. While the current year-end inflation expectation rose by 0.69 points to 13.81%, the 12-month ahead and 24-month ahead inflation expectations increased by 0.55 points and 0.44 points to 11.81% and 9.99%, respectively. 
Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks
7. The global economy, having contracted sharply in 2020 due to the pandemic, continues to recover on the back of accommodative policies and positive developments in the vaccination process. This improvement process is determined especially by the acceleration in manufacturing industry activity and global trade. However, despite ongoing vaccination efforts, risks to the global economic activity prevail due to uncertainties pertaining to the course of the pandemic.
8. Commodity prices have increased again in the recent period. Moreover, in tandem with improved growth expectations in advanced economies, the effects of the rising global inflation expectations on international financial markets remain significant. The normalization process has started in emerging economies, where policy rates remain well below historical averages. Long-term bond rates lead to uncertainties about advanced economy monetary policies, and volatility in global financial markets. The Committee noted that global inflationary pressures may lead to a tightening in monetary policies earlier than current projections, and maintained its assessment that a period marked by increased data-sensitivity and related volatilities in global financial markets was entered.
9. Since the last MPC meeting, portfolio flows to emerging economies have continued at a mild pace in both bond markets and equity markets. The volatility in long-term bond rates in advanced economies keeps the risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies alive. 
10. Driven by commodity prices and exchange rate developments, producer prices recorded a high rate of increase spread across the sectors in April as well. Moreover, supply constraints arising from disruptions in supply chains continue to have an adverse effect on the producer inflation.
11. In addition to commercial loans, consumer loans exhibit a milder course. The Committee assessed that the demand and cost-side inflationary effects persisted while a slight deceleration was observed in aggregate demand.
12. Despite the constraining effect of the pandemic, domestic economic activity is strong. Manufacturing industry activity exhibits a strong momentum. The seasonally-adjusted capacity utilization rate rose by 0.6 points to 76.2%, hovering close to pre-pandemic levels. While domestic demand has slightly decelerated due to pandemic restrictions, external demand remains strong. PMI data for April point to a sustained rise in export orders and a partial deceleration in domestic orders.
13. The weak course continues in the services sector, which has been adversely affected by the pandemic restrictions. The weekly credit card expenditures data suggest that after posting a recovery in March, the services sector activity weakened in the second half of April due to the re-tightening of pandemic measures. The Committee assessed that the additional pandemic measures announced for the 29 April-17 May 2021 period would continue to slow down economic activity, however this slowdown would remain more limited compared to the last year’s lockdown period. Nevertheless, risks for economic activity exist in either direction depending on the progress of the pandemic and the vaccination process.
14. In February, nonfarm employment remained flat while total and nonfarm unemployment rates rose by 0.7 points to 13.4% and 15.3%, respectively, due to the increase in the participation rate. The high-frequency labor market data suggest that amid tighter restrictions, the improvement trend in the labor market has come to a halt, and job opportunities have remained relatively weak in sectors directly affected by the restrictions and with more limited opportunity for remote work. In the manufacturing sector, the trend of employment remains strong.
15. Despite the rise in commodity prices, the strong upward trend in exports, the significant fall in gold imports and the slowdown in credit amid the tightening of financial conditions support the expected improvement in the current account balance. Preliminary data indicate that in April, exports excluding gold continued to rise on a monthly basis, whereas imports excluding gold declined in spite of the rise in commodity prices. The fall of gold imports significantly below their historical average in April after a gradual slowdown from the second half of January had a positive effect on the foreign trade balance. As the slowing effects of the tightening in financial conditions on the domestic demand and imports become more pronounced in the upcoming period, it is expected that the external balance will continue to improve. The Committee reiterated its assessment that supply problems in certain sectors, the automotive sector in particular, might constitute downside risk factors for the current account balance. The Committee maintained its emphasis on the importance of the course of the current account balance in terms of a lasting recovery in economic activity and financial stability.
Monetary Policy
16. The monetary policy stance will be set taking into account the upside risks to the inflation outlook and with a focus on bringing inflation down permanently in a cautious manner and achieving the price stability target. Accordingly, the policy stance will continue to be determined by taking into account inflation developments and inflation expectations, and at a degree of tightness that will restore the disinflation process as soon as possible and ensure its sustainability until the medium-term targets are achieved.
17. Demand and cost factors, supply constraints in some sectors, and high levels of inflation expectations continue to pose risks to the pricing behavior and inflation outlook. The decelerating impact of the monetary tightening on credit and domestic demand has begun to be observed. Taking into account the high levels of inflation and inflation expectations, the current monetary policy stance will be maintained until the significant fall in the April Inflation Report’s forecast path is achieved. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance by keeping the policy rate unchanged at 19%.
18. The tight monetary stance will serve as a significant buffer against external and temporary volatilities in the context of inflation expectations, pricing behavior and financial market developments.
19. The CBRT will continue to use decisively all available instruments in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. The policy rate will continue to be determined at a level above inflation to maintain a strong disinflationary effect until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5% target is reached.
20. The stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, reversal in currency substitution, accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and perpetual decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.
21. Demand and cost-side effects remain significant for inflation given credit market and economic activity indicators, as well as exchange rate volatility and developments in import prices. Consumer loans, along with commercial loans, exhibit a milder course, and the durability of this development is monitored for macroeconomic stability. The outlook for domestic demand, international prices and global risk appetite heightens the risks arising from external financing needs to the balance of payments. In formulating the monetary policy towards the target of price stability, the Committee will continue to follow an approach that also addresses the risks to financial stability.
22. The Committee reiterated its judgement that in order to achieve price stability, a strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders are required.
23.  The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework."

Press Release on the New Name of the Survey of Expectations
The name of the Survey of Expectations which has been implemented by the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) since 2001, has been changed to the “Survey of Market Participants” in order to avoid any misunderstanding in the public and the press that the survey indicates the CBRT’s institutional expectations and forecasts. The Survey of Market Participants covers financial and real sector professionals’ short and long-term expectations/forecasts regarding the main macroeconomic variables such as inflation, exchange rates, growth and interest rates.
The methodology and publication date of the Survey of Market Participants remain unchanged.
Accordingly, it is underlined once again that the results of the Market Participants Survey do not reflect the CBRT's own forecasts and expectations, and this survey is compiled from the estimates of financial and real sector professionals.

Press Release on Interest Rates
Participating Committee Members
Şahap Kavcıoğlu (Governor), Mustafa Duman, Elif Haykır Hobikoğlu, Uğur Namık Küçük, Emrah Şener, Semih Tümen, Abdullah Yavaş.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 19 percent.
The worldwide speeding up of vaccination rollout, especially in developed countries, supports the global economic recovery. Nonetheless, the increasing trend of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors and the rise in transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. The effects of the rising global inflation and inflation expectations on international financial markets remain significant.
Domestic economic activity is strong. While domestic demand has slightly decelerated in the second quarter due to pandemic restrictions and the tightening in financial conditions, external demand remains strong. The acceleration of domestic vaccination rollout facilitates the recovery in services and tourism sectors, which have been adversely affected by the pandemic, and leads to a more balanced composition in economic activity. Loan growth exhibits a mild course owing to the implemented monetary tightening. The course and composition of loans are monitored for macroeconomic stability. Despite the rise in commodity prices, the strong upward trend in exports, the slowdown in credit growth, the significant fall in gold imports and the strong progress in the vaccination program stimulating tourism activities are expected to accelerate the ongoing improvement in the current account balance.
In addition to the recent import-price-based cost factors, demand conditions, supply constraints in some sectors, and high levels of inflation expectations continue to pose risks to the pricing behavior and inflation outlook. On the other hand, the decelerating impact of the monetary tightening on credit and domestic demand has begun to be observed. Taking into account the high levels of inflation and inflation expectations, the current tight monetary policy stance will be maintained decisively until the significant fall in the April Inflation Report’s forecast path is achieved. Accordingly, the MPC has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged.
The CBRT will continue to use decisively all available instruments in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. The policy rate will continue to be determined at a level above inflation to maintain a strong disinflationary effect until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is reached.
The stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability positively through the fall in country risk premium, reversal in currency substitution, accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and perpetual decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.
The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

24 June 2021
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 17 June 2021
Inflation Developments
1.    Consumer prices rose by 0.89% in May, while annual inflation decreased by 0.55 points to 16.59%. Annual inflation receded in energy and core goods; remained relatively flat in the food group and increased in services. In this period, lockdown measures led to interruptions in economic activity in certain sectors, which recorded only limited price increases, in turn. Against this background, annual inflation rates and trends of B and C indices registered some decline, maintaining their high levels. 
2.    In May, prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 0.29% and the group’s annual inflation crept up by 0.06 points to 17.04%. Annual inflation edged down by 0.06 points to 14.61% in the unprocessed food group, but rose by 0.13 points to 19.49% in the processed food group. Annual inflation receded in fresh fruits and vegetables within the unprocessed food group, whereas it increased in the other unprocessed food group due to the hike in red meat prices. Meanwhile, processed food prices registered a monthly increase of 0.87%. Prices in the bread and cereals group rose by 1.00%, while non-alcoholic beverages stood out among other processed food. Moreover, increase in raw milk reference prices became another factor to keep risks to food inflation brisk. The uptrend in international food and agricultural commodity prices accelerated in May, and price hikes spread across all subcategories, with cereals and fats and oils in the lead. 
3.    Energy prices rose by 1.50% in May, while the group’s annual inflation declined by 0.73% to 17.71%. This is attributed to fuel prices that increased by 3.84% due to the uptick in international crude oil prices and exchange rate developments accompanied by adjustments in the sliding-scale system and termination of the price cap practice. It is considered that fuel prices will increase also in June amid the carry-over effects of the SCT rise in May, yet the high base effect will cause annual energy inflation to decline further. It should be emphasized that despite the recent adjustments, the sliding-scale practice continues to limit price increases both directly and indirectly.
4.    Prices of core goods rose by 0.86% in May and annual core goods inflation decreased by 2.29% to 20.84%. Annual inflation decreased across all subcategories, particularly in clothing and footwear. The recent trend of upsurge in the clothing and footwear group lost sizeable momentum due to lockdown effects, and annual inflation declined by 5.40 points to 5.56%. In durable goods, prices increased by 0.91%, while annual inflation decreased by 1.76 points, yet remained high at 30.74%. In addition to international commodity prices, exchange rate effects were visible in automobile and furniture items, while the mild course in electrical and non-electrical appliances limited the inflation. 
5.    In May, services prices increased by 1.18%, and annual services inflation rose by 0.50 points to 13.62%. Annual inflation surged in transport services; rose by a more limited rate in restaurants-hotels, communication and rent; and declined somewhat in other services. The surge in annual transport services inflation is attributed also to the increases in intercity bus fares due to capacity constraints led by pandemic measures. Price increases in the restaurants-hotels group remained quite moderate due to lockdown, while annual inflation maintained its uptrend owing to the low base. 
6.    Inflation expectations of market participants increased in June. While the current year-end inflation expectation rose by 0.65 points to 14.46%, the 12-month ahead and 24-month ahead inflation expectations increased by 0.31 points and 0.17 points to 12.12% and 10.16%, respectively. 
Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks
7.    The worldwide speeding up of vaccination rollout, especially in developed countries, supports the global economic recovery. Accelerated activity in the manufacturing industry and global trade as well as improvements in services bolster this recovery process. Pandemic-led downside risks to the global economic performance are reduced amid ongoing vaccination efforts.
8.    The increasing trend of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors and the rise in transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. The effects of the rising global inflation and inflation expectations on international financial markets remain significant. Since the previous MPC Meeting, the expectations of policy rate hike have been brought forward in tandem with the median expectations of the FOMC members, while inflation projections have also increased. The normalization process has started in emerging economies, where policy rates remain well below historical averages. This outlook points to increased uncertainties and a slight tightening in global financial conditions compared to the previous MPC Meeting period. Uncertainties regarding the course of long-term bond rates lead to volatility in global financial markets. The Committee maintained its assessment that global inflationary pressures increase data-sensitivity in monetary policies and global financial markets in turn, which may lead to volatilities.
9.    Since the last MPC meeting, portfolio inflows to emerging economies have been favorable in both bond markets and equity markets. Nonetheless, the volatility in long-term bond rates in advanced economies and the course of global financial conditions keep the risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies alive. 
10.    Driven by international commodity prices, exchange rate developments and supply constraints, producer prices recorded a high rate of increase also in May, which spread across the sectors. Although non-energy commodity prices displayed a slightly favorable outlook in June, it is considered that cost pressures on consumer prices have remained strong because of the depreciation in the Turkish lira and cumulative effects.
11.    Loan growth exhibits a mild course owing to the monetary tightening. However, short-term trends show that retail loan utilization has increased notably owing also to the deferred demand because of pandemic-led restrictions. The Committee assessed that a milder growth in retail loans is critical to curb risks to the inflation outlook and external balance. Accordingly, the course and composition of loans are monitored for macroeconomic stability. 
12.    Domestic economic activity is strong. Having increased by 7.0% annually and 1.7% quarterly in the first quarter of 2021, GDP confirmed the past evaluations of economic activity being above its potential despite the restraining effects of the pandemic. In this period, final domestic demand slowed down due to private consumption, while total investments and net exports made a positive contribution to the quarterly growth. On the production side, while the industrial and construction value-added were the main determinant of quarterly growth, the services value-added made a limited contribution to growth due to pandemic-led restrictions.
13.    While domestic demand has slightly decelerated in the second quarter due to pandemic restrictions and the tightening in financial conditions, external demand remains strong. The April readings of industrial production, turnover index and retail sales volume index revealed that the measures taken to prevent the spread of the pandemic as of mid-April restricted the economic activity. In April, the industrial production index decreased by 0.9% month-on-month and 0.3% quarter-on-quarter. Industrial turnover indices suggested that the slowdown in this period was driven by domestic demand. Likewise, while the services turnover index declined due to accommodation and catering services, the retail sales volume also went down amid restrictions.
14.    High-frequency data indicate that the additional pandemic measures announced for the 29 April-17 May 2021 period continued to slow down economic activity, and that, along with the gradual normalization steps, the rapidly increasing mobility exceeding the levels before the measures, point to a significant recovery in economic activity in the subsequent period. In fact, the weekly credit card expenditures data suggest that services sectors and retail trade items, which were affected more by the restrictions, registered substantial increases starting from the second half of May. For the period ahead, the acceleration of domestic vaccination rollout facilitates the recovery in services and tourism sectors, which have been adversely affected by the pandemic, and leads to a more balanced composition in economic activity. 
15.    The impact of restrictions on economic activity was also reflected in the labor market. While non-farm employment dropped by 1.1% in April over the previous month, the total unemployment rate rose by 0.9 points to 13.9%. High-frequency data suggest a rapid recovery in job opportunities and labor force participation rates following the easing of restrictions. In this respect, it is assessed that there may be employment increases in the services sector in the upcoming period. However, the rise in the labor force participation rates may limit the impact of employment increases on unemployment rates. 
16.    In April, the seasonally-adjusted current account balance started to improve. According to preliminary foreign trade data for May, seasonally-adjusted exports and imports excluding gold increased on a monthly basis. Despite the rise in commodity prices, the strong upward trend in exports, the slowdown in credit growth, the significant fall in gold imports and the strong progress in the vaccination program stimulating tourism activities are expected to accelerate the ongoing improvement in the current account balance. The Committee maintained its emphasis on the importance of the course of the current account balance in terms of a lasting recovery in economic activity and financial stability.
Monetary Policy
17.    The monetary policy stance will be set taking into account the upside risks to the inflation outlook and with a focus on bringing inflation down permanently in a cautious manner and achieving the price stability target. Accordingly, the policy stance will continue to be determined by taking into account inflation developments and inflation expectations, and at a degree of tightness that will restore the disinflation process as soon as possible and ensure its sustainability until the medium-term targets are achieved.
18.    In addition to the recent import-price-based cost factors, demand conditions, supply constraints in some sectors, and high levels of inflation expectations continue to pose risks to the pricing behavior and inflation outlook. On the other hand, the decelerating impact of the monetary tightening on credit and domestic demand has begun to be observed. Taking into account the high levels of inflation and inflation expectations, the current tight monetary policy stance will be maintained decisively until the significant fall in the April Inflation Report’s forecast path is achieved. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 19%.
19.    Inflation is expected to follow a volatile course in the short term due to various supply and demand side factors, with commodity prices in the lead. The tight monetary stance will serve as a significant buffer against external and temporary volatilities in the context of inflation expectations, pricing behavior and financial market developments.
20.    The CBRT will continue to use decisively all available instruments in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. The policy rate will continue to be determined at a level above inflation to maintain a strong disinflationary effect until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5% target is reached.
21.    The stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability positively through the fall in country risk premium, reversal in currency substitution, accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and perpetual decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.
22.    Demand and cost-side effects remain significant for inflation given credit market and economic activity indicators, as well as exchange rate volatility and developments in import prices. The ongoing improvement in the current account balance is expected to become more evident in the upcoming months due to the developments in foreign trade and tourism. On the other hand, the outlook for domestic demand, international prices and global risk appetite heightens the risks arising from external financing needs to the balance of payments. In formulating the monetary policy towards the target of price stability, the Committee will continue to follow an approach that also addresses the risks to financial stability.
23.    The Committee reiterated its judgement that in order to achieve price stability, a strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders are required.
24.    The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework."

Press Release on Interest Rates
Participating Committee Members
Şahap Kavcıoğlu (Governor), Mustafa Duman, Elif Haykır Hobikoğlu, Uğur Namık Küçük, Emrah Şener, Semih Tümen, Abdullah Yavaş.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 19 percent.
The worldwide speeding up of vaccination rollout, especially in developed countries, supports the global economic recovery. Nonetheless, economies advancing in their vaccination programs exhibit a stronger performance in economic activity by easing the restrictions. The strong recovery in the global demand, increasing trend of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors and the rise in transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. The effects of the rising global inflation and inflation expectations on international financial markets remain significant.
Domestic economic activity is strong. While domestic demand has slightly decelerated in the second quarter due to pandemic restrictions and the tightening in financial conditions, external demand remains strong. The acceleration of domestic vaccination rollout facilitates the recovery in services and tourism sectors, which have been adversely affected by the pandemic, and leads to a more balanced composition in economic activity. Commercial loan growth exhibits a mild course. The effects of the implemented macroprudential measures will be monitored on personal loans, which recently displayed a rise due to the reopening and deferred demand. Favorable external demand conditions and current tight monetary policy impact the current account balance positively. The current account is expected to post a surplus in the rest of the year due to the strong upward trend in exports, and the strong progress in the vaccination program stimulating tourism activities.
In addition to the recent increases in import prices and administered prices, demand conditions, supply constraints in some sectors, possible volatility in inflation during the summer due to the reopening, and high levels of inflation expectations continue to pose risks to the pricing behavior and inflation outlook. On the other hand, the decelerating impact of the monetary tightening on credit and domestic demand is being observed. Taking into account the high levels of inflation and inflation expectations, the current tight monetary policy stance will be maintained decisively until the significant fall in the April Inflation Report’s forecast path is achieved. Accordingly, the MPC has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged.
The CBRT will continue to use decisively all available instruments in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability.

19 July 2021
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 14 July 2021
Inflation Developments
1.    Consumer prices rose by 1.94% in June, and annual inflation increased by 0.94 points to 17.53%. Annual inflation rose in food and core goods, but decreased in energy and services. Amid normalization steps, price increases were recorded in certain sectors that had experienced interruptions in their economic activities. Against this background, annual inflation rates and trends of the B and C indices registered an uptick.
2.    In June, prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 0.88% and the group’s annual inflation rose by 2.95 points to 19.99%. Annual inflation soared by 4.09 points to 18.70% in the unprocessed food group, and rose by 1.71 points to 21.20% in the processed food group. Annual inflation remained flat in fresh fruits and vegetables within the unprocessed food group, whereas it increased notably in the other unprocessed food group due to the hikes in red and white meat prices. Meanwhile, processed food prices were mostly driven by the bread and cereals group, processed meat products, fats and oils and non-alcoholic beverages. Moreover, spikes in red meat prices and their spillover effects on the prices of meat products were notable in June. 
3.    Energy prices rose by 2.24% in June, while the group’s annual inflation declined by 0.43% points to 17.28%. With an upsurge of 6.33% due to the carry-over effects of the SCT rise in May, fuel prices pulled energy prices up. Despite the adjustment in May, the sliding-scale system averts possible price increases.  On the other hand, electricity and natural gas tariffs were increased in July, and LPG also recorded an uptick in prices. 
4.    Annual core goods inflation climbed by 1.08 points to 21.92% in June. Annual inflation increased across all subcategories, particularly in other core goods. In durable goods, prices increased by 2.98%, while annual inflation crept up by 0.12 points to 30.86%. These figures were led mainly by the white goods and furniture sectors, while other electrical and non-electrical appliances and automobile items also registered increases. Exchange rate developments, soaring commodity prices and the disruptions in supply chains shaped the prices of durable goods and other core goods. Meanwhile, the clothing and footwear group, which registers decreasing prices in every June due to the arrival of the sale season, saw monthly price increases in this period amid steps towards normalization. Annual inflation in clothing and footwear rose by 1.30 points to 6.86%, yet this level remained low and therefore continued to limit core goods inflation. 
5.    In June, services prices increased by 1.94%, while annual services inflation edged down by 0.16 points to 13.46%. The course of the group’s inflation was affected by the normalization steps taken both last year and this year. Annual inflation rose in restaurants-hotels, other services and rent, but declined in transport and communication services. In the restaurants-hotels group, prices soared in the eat-out meals and accommodation items, and annual inflation in this group rose by 1.13 points to 18.86%. In other services, amid reopening, annual inflation increased due to recreational and cultural services as well as maintenance and repair. In June, transport services registered price increases due to capacity restrictions in intercity passenger transport by road, but annual inflation receded in this group due to the base effect.
6.    Inflation expectations obtained from the Survey of Market Participants are revised upwards in July. While the current year-end inflation expectation rose by 1.18 points to 15.64%, the 12-month ahead and 24-month ahead inflation expectations increased by 0.50 points and 0.27 points to 12.62% and 10.43%, respectively. 
Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks
7.    The worldwide speeding up of vaccination rollout, especially in developed countries, supports the global economic recovery. With the normalizations steps, the divergence between services and industrial activities started to narrow down. Nonetheless, economies advancing in their vaccination programs exhibit a stronger performance in economic activity by easing the restrictions. On the other hand, some virus variants recently leading to resurgence of cases keep the uncertainties about the course of the pandemic in place. 
8.    The strong recovery in the global demand, increasing trend of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors and the rise in transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. The effects of the rising global inflation and inflation expectations on international financial markets remain significant. Since the previous MPC Meeting, monthly and annual inflation in some developed economies have increased above expectations. The normalization process has started in emerging economies, where policy rates remain well below historical averages, and some central banks have delivered rate hikes. This outlook points to increased uncertainties and a slight tightening in global financial conditions compared to the previous MPC Meeting period. The fluctuating course of global risk appetite and uncertainties regarding the course of long-term bond rates lead to volatility in global financial markets. The Committee maintained its assessment that global inflationary pressures increase data-sensitivity in monetary policies and global financial markets in turn, which may lead to volatilities. 
9.    Portfolio inflows to emerging economies continued in this MPC Meeting period on the back of bonds, albeit at a decelerated pace. Nonetheless, the volatility in long-term bond rates in advanced economies and the course of global financial conditions keep the risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies alive. 
10.    Driven by international commodity prices, disruptions in supply chains, as well as exchange rate developments, producer prices increased also in June. The rise in producer prices and the pressure it exerts on consumer prices have become more pronounced on a global scale, including advanced economies. On the other hand, the upward trend in non-energy commodity prices has reversed since June, albeit to a limited extent. 
11.    Commercial loan growth exhibits a mild course. The effects of the implemented macroprudential measures will be monitored on personal loans, which recently displayed a rise due to the reopening and deferred demand. The Committee maintained its assessment that a milder growth in personal loans is critical to curb risks to the inflation outlook and external balance. Accordingly, the course and composition of loans are closely monitored for macroeconomic stability.
12.    Domestic economic activity is strong. While domestic demand has slightly decelerated in the second quarter due to pandemic restrictions and the tightening in financial conditions, external demand remains strong. In April-May period, industrial production increased by 0.4% over the previous quarter. Industrial turnover indices suggest that this deceleration was driven by domestic demand due also to pandemic restrictions, while external demand was supportive of industrial production. In this period, the retail sales volume also went down amid restrictions.
13.    High-frequency data indicate that economic activity regained strength with the rapidly increasing mobility exceeding the levels before the measures due to the speeding up of vaccination and easing of pandemic restrictions. In fact, the weekly credit card expenditures data suggest that services sectors and retail trade items, which were affected more by the restrictions, registered higher rates of increases. The acceleration of domestic vaccination rollout facilitates the recovery in services and tourism sectors, which have been adversely affected by the pandemic, and leads to a more balanced composition in economic activity.
14.    The impact of restrictions on economic activity was also reflected in the labor market. As of May, total and non-farm unemployment rates increased quarter-on-quarter by 0.5 points and 0.7 points to 13.5% and 15.6%, respectively. High-frequency data suggest a rapid recovery in job opportunities following the easing of restrictions. In this respect, it is assessed that there may be employment increases in the services sector in the upcoming period. However, the rise in the labor force participation rates may limit the impact of employment increases on unemployment rates.  
15.    Favorable external demand conditions and the current tight monetary policy impact the current account balance positively. The current account balance ran a deficit of USD 3.1 billion in May, while the annual deficit decreased by USD 0.9 billion to USD 31.9 billion compared to the previous month. According to preliminary foreign trade data for June, seasonally-adjusted exports and imports excluding gold increased on a monthly basis. Despite the rise in commodity prices, the current account is expected to post a surplus in the rest of the year due to the strong upward trend in exports, and the strong progress in the vaccination program stimulating tourism activities. The Committee maintained its emphasis on the importance of the course of the current account balance in terms of a lasting recovery in economic activity and financial stability.   
Monetary Policy
16.    The monetary policy stance will be set taking into account the upside risks to the inflation outlook and with a focus on bringing inflation down permanently in a cautious manner and achieving the price stability target. Accordingly, the policy stance will continue to be determined by taking into account inflation developments and inflation expectations, and at a degree of tightness that will restore the disinflation process as soon as possible and ensure its sustainability until the medium-term targets are achieved.
17.    In addition to the recent increases in import prices and administered prices, demand conditions, supply constraints in some sectors, possible volatility in inflation during the summer due to the reopening, and high levels of inflation expectations continue to pose risks to the pricing behavior and inflation outlook. On the other hand, the decelerating impact of the monetary tightening on credit and domestic demand is being observed. Taking into account the high levels of inflation and inflation expectations, the current tight monetary policy stance will be maintained decisively until the significant fall in the April Inflation Report’s forecast path is achieved. Accordingly, the MPC has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 19%.
18.    Inflation is expected to follow a volatile course in the short term due to various supply and demand side factors, with commodity prices and administered prices in the lead. The impact of possible short-term volatilities in inflation on the underlying trend will be monitored closely for the monetary policy stance. The tight monetary stance will serve as a significant buffer against external and temporary volatilities in the context of inflation expectations, pricing behavior and financial market developments.
19.    The CBRT will continue to use decisively all available instruments in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. The policy rate will continue to be determined at a level above inflation to maintain a strong disinflationary effect until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5% target is reached.
20.    The stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability positively through the fall in country risk premium, reversal in currency substitution, accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and perpetual decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.
21.    Demand and cost-side effects remain significant for inflation given credit market and economic activity indicators, as well as exchange rate volatility and developments in import prices. While the current tight monetary policy keeps demand-side factors under control by containing loans and domestic demand, it also supports the improvement in the current account balance. Nevertheless, the outlook for monetary policies in advanced economies and global risk appetite heighten the risks to the portfolio flows towards emerging economies. In formulating the monetary policy towards the target of price stability, the Committee will continue to follow an approach that also addresses the risks to financial stability.
22.    The Committee reiterated its judgement that in order to achieve price stability, a strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders are required.
23.    The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework."

Press Release on Interest Rates
Participating Committee Members
Şahap Kavcıoğlu (Governor), Mustafa Duman, Elif Haykır Hobikoğlu, Uğur Namık Küçük, Emrah Şener, Semih Tümen, Abdullah Yavaş.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 19 percent.
Worldwide speeding up of vaccination rollout, especially in developed countries, supports the global economic recovery. Nonetheless, economies advancing in their vaccination programs exhibit a stronger performance in economic activity by easing the restrictions. Strong recovery in global demand, high course of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors and rise in transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. Unfavorable effects of weather conditions in major agricultural commodity exporting countries are observed on global food prices. The effects of rising global inflation and inflation expectations on international financial markets remain significant.
Leading indicators show that domestic economic activity remains strong in the third quarter, with the help of robust external demand. The acceleration of domestic vaccination rollout facilitates the recovery in services and tourism sectors, which have been adversely affected by the pandemic, and leads to a more balanced composition in economic activity. Commercial loan growth exhibits a mild course. The Committee monitors the adequacy of the implemented macroprudential measures to curb personal loan growth, which recently displayed a rise due to the reopening and deferred demand. Favorable external demand conditions and current tight monetary policy impact the current account balance positively. The current account is expected to post a surplus in the rest of the year due to the strong upward trend in exports, and the strong progress in the vaccination program stimulating tourism activities. The improvement in the current account balance is important for the price stability objective.
In addition to the recent increases in import prices and administered prices, demand conditions, supply constraints in some sectors, possible volatility in inflation during the summer due to the reopening, and high levels of inflation expectations continue to pose risks to the pricing behavior and inflation outlook. The increase in inflation in July was driven by the rise in food inflation, due to supply-side effects in some products led by climate conditions, the high levels of international agricultural commodity and food prices, as well as the effects of the reopening. On the other hand, the decelerating impact of the monetary tightening on credit and domestic demand is being observed. Taking into account the high levels of inflation and inflation expectations, the current tight monetary policy stance will be maintained decisively until the significant fall in the Inflation Report’s forecast path is achieved. Accordingly, the MPC has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged.
The CBRT will continue to use decisively all available instruments in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. The policy rate will continue to be determined at a level above inflation to maintain a strong disinflationary effect until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is reached.
Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, reversal in currency substitution, accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and perpetual decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.
The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework.

19 August 2021
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 12 August 2021
Inflation Developments
1.    Consumer prices rose by 1.80% in July, and annual inflation increased by 1.42 points to 18.95%. While this development was mainly driven by the rise in food and energy groups, annual inflation increased moderately in services and decreased slightly in core goods. In July, the Turkish lira followed a mild course while international energy prices rose, and non-energy commodity markets continued to register decreases, albeit to a limited extent. Nonetheless, producer inflation remained on the rise due to lagged effects and the ongoing disruptions in supply chains. Against this background, annual inflation increased in the B index but decreased in the C index, while the recent trends of these core indicators remained high.
2.    In July, prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 2.77%, and the group’s annual inflation rose by 4.93 points to 24.92%. In addition to the high levels of international agricultural commodity and food prices, cumulative exchange rate effects, and weather conditions, supply constraints for certain products affected food producer inflation adversely, and these increases spilled over into consumer prices with the reopening. Annual inflation rose by 7.03 points to 25.73% in the unprocessed food group, and by 2.93 points to 24.13% in the processed food group. Seasonally adjusted data in the unprocessed food group pointed to a significant monthly increase in the prices of fresh fruits and vegetables, with fruits in the lead. While milk prices rose due to the regulation in raw milk reference prices, there were also increases in prices of some pulses whose domestic production decreased due to weather conditions. In the processed food group, the subcategories that diverged negatively were bread and cereals, cheese and other dairy products, and processed meat products. Another significant subcategory in this period was fats and oils due to external price pressures. 
3.    Energy prices surged by 6.19% in July while the group’s annual inflation rose by 4.23 points to 21.51%. Electricity and natural gas prices increased by 15.01% and 9.84%, respectively, becoming the main drivers of the price dynamics in the energy group. While part of the required price increase in LPG was met through the sliding scale system, part of it was reflected in prices. Bottled gas prices also rose in parallel to the increase in LPG prices.
4.    Annual core goods inflation fell by 0.70 points to 21.22% in July. The Turkish lira followed a relatively mild course in this period, which alleviated pressures driven by import prices. Annual inflation decreased in durable consumption goods, but increased in other subcategories. In July, prices of durable goods edged down by 0.11%, while annual inflation thereof registered a decline by 3.68 points to 27.18%. These figures were led mainly by the fall in furniture prices as well as the base effect despite the ongoing monthly increases in electrical and non-electrical appliances, with white goods in the lead. Meanwhile, the clothing and footwear group, which followed a moderate course amid restrictions, maintained the uptrend stimulated by the reopening, and the group’s annual inflation rose by 1.51 points to 8.37%. Reacting more sluggishly to developments in the exchange rate and import prices compared to durable goods, other core goods registered a further increase in annual inflation.
5.    In July, services prices increased by 1.32%, while annual group inflation edged up by 0.29 points to 13.75%. Annual inflation rose in restaurants-hotels and transport services, remained flat in rent, and declined in communication and other services. Amid normalization steps, prices increased in the eat-out meals and accommodation services in the restaurants-hotels group in July as well. The negative outlook in catering services is attributable also to the high food inflation. In this period, prices remained relatively flat in transport services, yet annual inflation in this group increased due to the low base. Against this background, prices of services excluding restaurants-hotels recorded a relatively mild course in July.
6.    In July, annual inflation in the alcoholic beverages and tobacco group decreased slightly as the increase in the PPI of the last six months was not reflected to lump-sum and minimum lump-sum taxes.
7.    The August results of the Survey of Market Participants indicated that the current year-end inflation expectation was revised upwards and the 12-month ahead inflation expectation downwards. Accordingly, while the current year-end inflation expectation rose by 0.66 points to 16.30%, the 12-month ahead inflation expectation fell by 0.14 points to 12.48%. Currently, the 24-month ahead inflation expectation is 10.52%.
 Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks
8.    Worldwide speeding up of vaccination rollout, especially in developed countries, supports the global economic recovery. Leading indicators suggest that with the normalization steps taken, the services sector, which was affected more by pandemic restrictions, has been accompanying the ongoing recovery in the manufacturing sector. Nonetheless, economies advancing in their vaccination programs exhibit a stronger performance in economic activity by easing the restrictions. On the other hand, some virus variants recently leading to a resurgence of cases keep the downside risks to the global economic activity posed by the uncertainties about the course of the pandemic in place. 
9.    Strong recovery in global demand, high course of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors and rise in transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. Unfavorable effects of weather conditions in major agricultural commodity exporting countries are observed on global food prices. The effects of rising global inflation and inflation expectations on international financial markets remain significant. Since the previous MPC Meeting, monthly and annual inflation rates in some developed economies have increased further. The normalization process in emerging economies has continued and some central banks have delivered additional tightening. This outlook points to increased uncertainties and a slight tightening in global financial conditions. The fluctuating course of global risk appetite and uncertainties regarding the course of long-term bond rates lead to volatility in global financial markets. The Committee maintained its assessment that global inflationary pressures increase data sensitivity in monetary policies and global financial markets in turn, which may lead to volatilities.
10.    In this MPC Meeting period, portfolio outflows from emerging economies have stemmed from equity markets, while bond markets have attracted inflows to a limited extent. The volatility in long-term bond rates in advanced economies and the course of global financial conditions keep the risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies alive.
11.    Producer inflation continued to rise in July due to the lagged effects of international commodity prices, the lingering problems in supply chains, and the adjustments made to domestic energy prices. In this period, producer prices increased in energy, wood and cork products, the base metal sector, which is one of the sectors providing input to the manufacturing industry, and the construction sector-related non-metallic mineral products. On a global scale, the level hit by producer prices has continued to exert pressure on consumer prices.
12.    Commercial loan growth exhibits a mild course. The Committee monitors the adequacy of the implemented macroprudential measures to curb personal loan growth, which recently displayed a rise due to the reopening and deferred demand. The Committee also maintained its assessment that a milder growth in personal loans is critical to curb risks to the inflation outlook and external balance. Accordingly, the course and composition of loans are closely monitored for macroeconomic stability.
13.    Domestic economic activity remained strong in the second quarter. In June, the industrial production index increased by 2.3% month-on-month and 23.7% year-on-year. Thus, up 1.6% from the first quarter, production remained strong in the second quarter. Indices for turnover and retail sales volume also recorded a sharp increase in June due to the reopening. However, domestic real turnover in manufacturing and retail sales experienced a quarterly decline in the second quarter.
14.    Leading indicators show that domestic economic activity remains strong in the third quarter with the help of robust external demand. High-frequency data show a rapid recovery in the pandemic-stricken subsectors of services amid increased mobility. In fact, the weekly credit card expenditures data suggest that services sectors and retail trade items, which were affected more by the restrictions, registered higher rates of increases. After the reopening, confidence indices registered increases across all sectors in June and July, particularly in services. The acceleration of the domestic vaccination rollout facilitates the recovery in services and tourism sectors, which have been adversely affected by the pandemic, and leads to a more balanced composition in economic activity.
15.    In June, total and non-farm unemployment rates were down 2.5 and 2.7 points from May to 10.6% and 12.3%, respectively, thanks to the overall growth of non-farm employment and reduced labor force participation. High-frequency data point to a reopening-induced recovery in the labor market. In this respect, it is assessed that there may be employment increases in the services sector in the upcoming period. However, the rise in labor force participation rates may limit the impact of employment increases on unemployment rates.
16.    Favorable external demand conditions and current tight monetary policy impact the current account balance positively. The current account is expected to post a surplus in the rest of the year due to the strong upward trend in exports, and the strong progress in the vaccination program stimulating tourism activities. The improvement in the current account balance is important for the price stability objective. The Committee once again underlined its emphasis on the importance of the course of the current account balance for the sustainability of recovery in economic activity and financial stability.
Monetary Policy 
17.    The monetary policy stance will be set taking into account the upside risks to the inflation outlook and with a focus on bringing inflation down permanently in a cautious manner and achieving the price stability target. Accordingly, the policy stance will continue to be determined by taking into account inflation developments and inflation expectations, and at a degree of tightness that will restore the disinflation process as soon as possible and ensure its sustainability until the medium-term targets are achieved.
18.    In addition to the recent increases in import prices and administered prices, demand conditions, supply constraints in some sectors, possible volatility in inflation during the summer due to the reopening, and high levels of inflation expectations continue to pose risks to the pricing behavior and inflation outlook. The increase in inflation in July was driven by the rise in food inflation, due to supply-side effects in some products led by climate conditions, the high levels of international agricultural commodity and food prices, as well as the effects of the reopening. On the other hand, the decelerating impact of the monetary tightening on credit and domestic demand is being observed. Taking into account the high levels of inflation and inflation expectations, the current tight monetary policy stance will be maintained decisively until the significant fall in the Inflation Report’s forecast path is achieved. Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 19%.
19.    Inflation is expected to follow a volatile course in the short term due to various supply and demand side factors, with commodity prices and administered prices in the lead. The impact of possible short-term volatilities in inflation on the underlying trend will be monitored closely for the monetary policy stance. The tight monetary stance will serve as a significant buffer against external and temporary volatilities in the context of inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and financial market developments.
20.    The CBRT will continue to use decisively all available instruments in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. The policy rate will continue to be determined at a level above inflation to maintain a strong disinflationary effect until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is reached.
21.    Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, reversal in currency substitution, accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and perpetual decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.
22.    Demand and cost-side effects remain significant for inflation given credit market and economic activity indicators as well as exchange rate volatility and developments in import prices. While the current tight monetary policy keeps demand-side factors under control by containing loans and domestic demand, it also supports the improvement in the current account balance. Nevertheless, the outlook for monetary policies in advanced economies and the global risk appetite heighten the risks to the portfolio flows towards emerging economies. In formulating the monetary policy towards the target of price stability, the Committee will continue to follow an approach that also addresses the risks to financial stability.
23.    The Committee reiterated that in order to achieve price stability, strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders are required.
24.    The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework."

Press Release on Unauthorized Payment Service Providers
The CBRT is assigned with the duty to regulate and supervise payments in accordance with the Law no. 6493 on Payment And Securities Settlement Systems, Payment Services and Electronic Money Institutions.
Recently, notifications and complaints have been filed that some businesses and individuals are acting as intermediaries in money transfer and bill payment services without the permit and authorization required by the relevant legislation, and that money is being collected from third parties for this purpose. There are numerous reports that the collected funds are not being used in payments, leading to unjust treatment.
Providing payment services in our country is allowed only after obtaining the required licenses. Payment services can be provided by banks, the Post and Telegraph Organization Inc. (PTT) as well as payment institutions and electronic money institutions that hold operating licenses. Institutions authorized to be intermediaries in money transfers, bill payments and similar payment services are announced* on the CBRT website. Persons who cannot be definitely shown to have the authorization to provide payment services should not be relied on and no payments should be made through their intermediation.
In addition, providing payment services is against the law except for banks, the PTT as well as the listed payment and electronic money institutions and their representatives. The CBRT applies to the relevant Chief Public Prosecutor's Offices to ensure that investigations and proceedings are commenced against businesses and individuals operating without permits. Avoiding payment services other than authorized institutions and organizations and notifying the CBRT of the allegations of illegal payment services will help to prevent possible unjust treatment.
Reporting businesses and individuals acting as payment and electronic money institutions or their authorized representatives without the required licenses, permits and authorizations through the Contact Us (For Your Questions) tab on the CBRT website or the Ask the CBRT (TCMB’ye Sorun, in Turkish) tab on the e-Government website is important to help the CBRT to apply to the Chief Public Prosecutor's Office.

Press Release on Central Bank Digital Turkish Lira R&D Project




The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey has signed bilateral memorandums of understanding with ASELSAN, HAVELSAN and TÜBİTAK-BİLGEM, and established the “Digital Turkish Lira Collaboration Platform”.




The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) continues to research the potential benefits of introducing a digital Turkish lira to complement the existing payments infrastructure. As part of the Central Bank Digital Turkish Lira Research and Development (R&D) Project, the process that started with the completion of the proof of concept now moves on to the next stage with the participation of technology stakeholders.
The technological research, development and testing processes of the Central Bank Digital Turkish Lira R&D Project will be carried out in close collaboration with these technology stakeholders. Accordingly, the CBRT has signed bilateral memorandums of understanding with ASELSAN, HAVELSAN and TÜBİTAK-BİLGEM, and established the “Digital Turkish Lira Collaboration Platform”. In the light of the findings of the first phase, which involves preliminary testing of strategic and critical technologies related to the project, the plan is to expand the platform with the involvement of new participants.
For the first phase of the pilot study, the CBRT will develop a prototype ""Digital Turkish Lira Network"" and run limited closed-circuit pilot tests with technology stakeholders. Based on the results of those tests, the CBRT will unveil advanced phases of the pilot study that will reflect a broader participation. The CBRT also plans to carry out tests that may diversify the coverage of the Digital Turkish Lira R&D Project into areas such as blockchain technology, the use of distributed ledgers in payment systems, and integration with instant payment systems.
The CBRT has made no final decision regarding the issuance of the digital Turkish lira. All research is carried out as per the principles of experimental R&D activities. After capacity measurements of different technological alternatives are completed and the architectural setups are finalized, it will be decided whether the existing technologies can meet the economic, legal and financial requirements of the digital Turkish lira.
The results of the first phase will be announced in 2022 after the tests are completed.

Press Release on Rediscount Credits for Export and Foreign Exchange Earning Services




The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey has changed the conditions for utilization and repayment of rediscount credits for export and foreign exchange earning services. 




The conditions for utilization and repayment of rediscount credits for export and foreign exchange earning services have been changed as follows, to be effective from 1 October 2021:
The total rediscount credit limit has been increased to USD 30 billion. Of this limit, USD 20 billion is allocated to the credits to be extended via the Export Credit Bank of Turkey (Turk Eximbank), and USD 10 billion is allocated to the credits to be extended via other banks. The Turkish lira equivalent of USD 5 billion of the aforementioned total limit can also be used for rediscount credits in Turkish lira.

Credits will be extended to net exporter firms with an export amount that is at least 10% more than their import amount in the last three years or the last year.
Credits can only be used for payments of the specified expenditures in Turkish lira.
Credit repayments will be made only with export proceeds.
The maximum maturity of credits has been updated to 180 days from 240 days. For credits that are extended to finance exports to new markets, exports of high technology products and foreign exchange earning services, the maximum maturity will remain as 360 days.
The maximum commission rates that can be charged by intermediary banks will be 100 basis points.
For firms that make a commitment to sell additional export proceeds to the CBRT, the interest rate applicable to the credit will be discounted.

Press Release on Interest Rates
Participating Committee Members
Şahap Kavcıoğlu (Governor), Mustafa Duman, Elif Haykır Hobikoğlu, Uğur Namık Küçük, Emrah Şener, Semih Tümen.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 19 percent to 18 percent.
Worldwide speeding up of vaccination rollout, especially in developed countries, supports the global economic recovery. Nonetheless, despite the increase in the vaccination rate, new variants keep the downside risks to global economic activity alive. Strong recovery in global demand, high course of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors and rise in transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. Unfavorable effects of weather conditions in major agricultural commodity exporting countries are observed on global food prices. While the effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored, central banks in advanced economies assess that the rise in inflation would be mostly temporary along with normalization in demand composition, easing of supply constraints and waning base effects. Accordingly, central banks in advanced economies continue their supportive monetary stances and asset purchase programs.
Leading indicators show that domestic economic activity remains strong in the third quarter, with the help of robust external demand. The acceleration of domestic vaccination rollout facilitates the recovery in services, tourism and related sectors, which have been adversely affected by the pandemic, and leads to a more balanced composition in economic activity. Favorable external demand conditions and current tight monetary policy impact the current account balance positively. The current account is expected to post a surplus in the rest of the year due to the strong upward trend in exports, and the strong progress in the vaccination program stimulating tourism activities. The improvement in the current account balance is important for the price stability objective.
Recent increase in inflation has been driven by supply side factors such as rise in food and import prices and supply constraints, increase in administered prices and demand developments due to the reopening. It is assessed that these effects are due to transitory factors. On the other hand, the decelerating impact of the monetary tightening on credit and domestic demand is being observed. The tightness in monetary stance has started to have a higher than envisaged contractionary effect on commercial loans. In addition, macroprudential policy framework has been strengthened to curb personal loan growth. The Committee evaluated the analyses to decompose the impact of demand factors that monetary policy can have an effect, core inflation developments and supply shocks. Accordingly it is judged that a revision in monetary policy stance is needed and the policy rate was decided to be reduced.
The CBRT will continue to use decisively all available instruments until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.

30 September 2021
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 23 September 2021
Inflation Developments
1.    Consumer prices rose by 1.12% in August, and annual inflation increased by 0.30 points to 19.25%. While the rise in food prices was determinant in this development, annual inflation slowed in core indices. The Turkish lira followed a relatively stable course in August, and items that are highly sensitive to exchange rates performed better. In the same period, international oil prices fell whereas prices for agricultural products and industrial metals increased. Accordingly, annual inflation went down in B and C indices but the recent trends of these core indicators remained high.
2.    In August, prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 3.18%, and their annual inflation soared by 4.08 points to 29%. The upsurge in food prices was mostly driven by prices of fresh fruits and vegetables, while droughts in Turkey and across the world have negative implications for consumer food prices. Annual inflation surged by 6.72 points to 32.45% in unprocessed food, and by 1.69 points to 25.82% in processed food. In seasonally adjusted terms, prices of fresh fruits and vegetables continued to rise significantly in August amid weather conditions, driving unprocessed food prices higher. Among other unprocessed food items, increase in egg prices was notable, and the outlook for prices of pulses remained bleak. On the processed food front, the subcategories that saw price hikes were bread and cereals as well as cheese and other dairy products, the latter of which reflect the rise in raw milk prices.
3.    In August, energy prices increased by 0.63%, while the group’s annual inflation decreased by 0.79 points to 20.72%. The sliding scale system continued to curb annual inflation in the energy group, meanwhile, fuel prices slightly increased in August mainly due to the rise in LPG prices for which the SCT was formerly reduced to zero. Bottled gas prices increased in tandem with the rise in LPG prices. In addition to the uptrend in electricity market clearing prices due to weather conditions, international natural gas and coal prices are on the rise as well.  
4.    In August, annual core goods inflation decreased by 0.94 points to 20.28%. While annual inflation declined in durable goods and clothing-footwear groups, it increased in other core goods. Prices of durable goods dropped by 1.02%, while annual inflation of the group decreased by 2.97 points to 24.21%. While prices of furniture and white goods posted moderate increases, prices of automobiles decreased owing to the SCT tax base adjustment for automobiles. In clothing and footwear, annual inflation slowed down due to more significant end-of-season sales compared to previous years. Overall, in August, the relatively stable course of the Turkish lira suppressed pressures led by international commodity developments and annual inflation in core goods decreased underpinned by the SCT tax base adjustment.
5.    In August, services prices increased by 1.25%, while annual group inflation edged up by 0.13 points to 13.88%. While annual inflation rose in restaurants-hotels, communication services and rent, it remained flat in transport services, and declined in other services. High increases in the restaurants-hotels group in line with re-opening continued in August albeit with some deceleration. The monthly increase in rents gained some pace in August. The decline in annual inflation in other services was led by services items with high sensitivity to the exchange rate following the relatively stable course of the Turkish lira.
6.    The September results of the Survey of Market Participants indicated that inflation expectations were revised upwards. Accordingly, the current year-end inflation expectation rose by 0.44 points to 16.74%, and the 12-month ahead inflation expectation increased by 0.46 points to 12.94%. Currently, the 24-month ahead inflation expectation is 10.71%.
Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks
7.    The worldwide speeding up of vaccination rollout, especially in developed countries, supports the global economic recovery. Leading indicators suggest that the strong recovery in the global economy continues, albeit at a somewhat decelerated pace. Economies advancing in their vaccination programs exhibit a stronger performance in economic activity by easing the restrictions. Nonetheless, despite the increase in the vaccination rate, new variants keep the downside risks to global economic activity alive.
8.    Strong recovery in global demand, high course of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors, and the rise in transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. Unfavorable effects of weather conditions in major agricultural commodity exporting countries are observed on global food prices. While the effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored, central banks in advanced economies assess that the rise in inflation will prove to be mostly temporary with the normalization in demand composition, easing of supply constraints, and waning base effects. Accordingly, central banks in advanced economies continue their supportive monetary stances and asset purchase programs.
9.    In this MPC Meeting period, equity and bond markets of emerging economies have attracted portfolio inflows to a limited extent. The volatility in long-term bond rates in advanced economies and the course of global financial conditions keep the risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies alive. The impact of such risks through portfolio flows channel towards Turkey are judged to prove to be relatively limited, considering the current levels of non-residents’ portfolio positions.
10.    Producer inflation continued to rise in August due to international commodity prices, the lingering problems in supply chains, and energy prices. According to main industrial groups, the increases in energy and intermediate goods groups stood out in August. Agricultural drought that has become evident in some regions leads to a change in the composition of electricity production, having an upward effect on industrial electricity costs. The increase in intermediate goods prices was driven by metals-related products, items such as wood and cork products that provide input to the furniture sector, and the construction sector-related non-metallic mineral products. 
11.    Although economic activity lost some momentum in the second quarter due to pandemic restrictions and the tightening in financial conditions, it remained above its long-term trend. In the second quarter of 2021, GDP increased by 21.7% in annual terms and by 0.9% in quarterly terms. On the production side, industrial and services sectors were the main drivers of annual and quarterly growth whereas construction and agricultural sectors limited the quarterly growth. On the expenditures side, private consumption and net exports had the largest contribution to quarterly growth while public expenditures and investments remained mild.
12.    Leading indicators show that domestic economic activity remains strong in the third quarter, with the help of robust external demand. In July, the industrial production index decreased by 4.2% month-on-month and by 2.3% year-on-year. The sector-wide decrease of production in this period is attributed to the loss of working days (bridging day effect) driven by the bridging the official holiday of 15 July (Thursday) with the Feast of Sacrifice (Eid al-Adha) holiday (17-25 July), which was extended to 9 days. Excluding this effect, the underlying trend of industrial production remained strong. Survey indicators and export data for August hint that the decline in industrial production will be compensated in August. Meanwhile, the services and construction turnover indices, along with retail sales posted monthly and quarterly increases in July.
13.    High–frequency data indicate a rapid recovery in the services items most affected by the pandemic due to increased mobility in the third quarter. In fact, the weekly credit card expenditures data suggest that services sectors and retail trade items, which were affected more by the restrictions, registered higher rates of increases. The acceleration of domestic vaccination rollout facilitates the recovery in services, tourism and related sectors, which have been adversely affected by the pandemic, and leads to a more balanced composition in economic activity.
14.    While employment continued to grow in July led by the services sector, the total and non-farm unemployment rates increased by 1.4 points and 1.6 points month-on-month to 12.0% and 13.9%, respectively, due to the rise in the labor force participation rate. Survey indicators and high-frequency data suggest that the improvement in the employment outlook and the positive course in the labor market continue thanks to the reopening and the course of economic activity. 
15.    Favorable external demand conditions and current tight monetary policy impact the current account balance positively. According to the provisional foreign trade data for August, seasonally adjusted exports and imports excluding gold, have posted high increases over the previous month, most visibly in exports. The recovery trend in tourism revenues has also become more evident. The current account is expected to post a surplus in the rest of the year due to the strong upward trend in exports, and the strong progress in the vaccination program stimulating tourism activities. The improvement in the current account balance is important for the price stability objective. The Committee once again underlined its emphasis on the importance of the course of the current account balance for the sustainability of recovery in economic activity and financial stability.
Monetary Policy
16.    The monetary policy stance will be set by taking into account the evaluations on the source and permanence of risks, along with the extent to which they can be contained by monetary policy, and with a focus on bringing inflation down permanently in a cautious manner and achieving the price stability target. Accordingly, the policy stance will continue to be determined by taking into account inflation developments, inflation expectations, as well as the temporary factors projected to bear effect on these in the short term, and at a degree of tightness that will restore the disinflation process as soon as possible and ensure its sustainability until the medium-term targets are achieved. 
17.    Recent increase in inflation has been driven by supply side factors such as rise in food and import prices and supply constraints, increase in administered prices and demand developments due to the reopening. It is assessed that these effects are due to transitory factors. On the other hand, the decelerating impact of the monetary tightening on credit and domestic demand is being observed. The tightness in monetary stance has started to have a higher than envisaged contractionary effect on commercial loans. While the nominal commercial loan growth remains well below previous year averages, the strong course in personal loans has largely remained in place. In addition, the macroprudential policy framework has been strengthened to curb personal loan growth. Accordingly, the impact of the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency’s related decisions will be monitored. The Committee also maintained its assessment that a milder growth in personal loans is critical to curb risks to the inflation outlook and external balance. Accordingly, the course and composition of loans are closely monitored for macroeconomic stability. The Committee evaluated the analyses to decompose the impact of demand factors that monetary policy can have an effect, core inflation developments and supply shocks. Accordingly it is judged that a revision in monetary policy stance is needed and the policy rate was decided to be reduced by 100 basis points.
18.    Inflation is expected to follow a volatile course in the short term due to various supply and demand side factors, with commodity prices and administered prices in the lead. However, sufficiently tight monetary stance to ensure the return of inflation to its downward trend once temporary effects disappear, will serve as a significant buffer against external and temporary volatilities in the context of inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and financial market developments.
19.    The CBRT will continue to use decisively all available instruments until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. 
20.    Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in the country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.
21.    Demand and cost-side effects remain significant for inflation given credit market and economic activity indicators as well as exchange rate volatility and developments in import prices. The outlook for monetary policies in advanced economies and the global risk appetite heighten the risks to the portfolio flows towards emerging economies. In formulating the monetary policy towards the target of price stability, the Committee will continue to follow an approach that also addresses the risks to financial stability.
22.    The Committee reiterated that in order to achieve price stability, strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders are required.
23.    The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework."

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 18 percent to 16 percent.
Despite the recovery in global economic activity in the first half of the year, recently published confidence indices have started to decline due to the effect of the pandemic. Nonetheless, despite the increase in the vaccination rate, new variants keep the downside risks to global economic activity alive. Recovery in global demand, high course of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors and rise in transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. Unfavorable effects of weather conditions in major agricultural commodity exporting countries are observed on global food prices. While the effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored, central banks in advanced economies assess that the rise in inflation would be mostly temporary along with normalization in demand composition, easing of supply constraints and waning base effects. Accordingly, central banks in advanced economies continue their supportive monetary stances and asset purchase programs.
Leading indicators show that domestic economic activity remains strong, with the help of robust external demand. The spread of domestic vaccination throughout the society facilitates the recovery in services, tourism and related sectors, which have been adversely affected by the pandemic, and leads to a more balanced composition in economic activity. While the demand for durable consumer goods slows down, a recovery is observed in non-durable consumer goods. The improvement in annualized current account is expected to continue in the rest of the year due to the strong upward trend in exports, and the strengthening of this trend is important for the price stability objective.
Recent increase in inflation has been driven by supply side factors such as rise in food and import prices, especially in energy, and supply constraints, increase in administered prices and demand developments due to the reopening. It is assessed that these effects are due to transitory factors. On the other hand, the decelerating impact of the monetary tightening on credit and domestic demand is being observed. The tightness in monetary stance has started to have a higher than envisaged contractionary effect on commercial loans. In addition, strengthened macroprudential policy framework has started to curb personal loan growth. The Committee evaluated the analyses to decompose the impact of demand factors that monetary policy can have an effect, core inflation developments and supply shocks. Accordingly the Committee decided to reduce the policy rate by 200 basis points to 16 percent. Nevertheless, the Committee assessed that, till the end of the year, supply-side transitory factors leave limited room for the downward adjustment to the policy rate.
In order to contain climate-based and other environmental risks, the Committee also decided to support sustainable finance initiatives as a long-term policy without prejudice to the main objectives of monetary policy.
The CBRT will continue to use decisively all available instruments until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.
The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework.

28 October 2021
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 21 October 2021
Inflation Developments
1.    In September, consumer prices rose by 1.25%, and annual inflation increased by 0.33 points to 19.58%. The rise was mainly driven by price increases in services and energy groups. Prices of solid fuels such as coal increased due to developments in international markets and energy prices rose on the back of price increments in municipal water. Annual inflation in the food group prices inched down following the acceleration in price increases during summer. Meanwhile, producer inflation remained elevated as problems in supply chains and increases in commodity market and domestic energy prices continued. Against this background, while the annual inflation increased in the B and C indices, the recent trends of these core indicators decreased slightly.   
2.    In September, prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 0.50%, and the group’s annual inflation decreased by 0.21 points to 28.79%. Annual inflation in the processed food group remained flat at 25.79% while that of unprocessed food posted a limited fall to 32.06%. While prices in the processed food group increased by 1.46%, prices in the bread and cereals sub-group increased by 2.54% parallel to the outlook in the grain market. Unprocessed food prices decreased by 0.53% with the correction in the prices of fresh fruits and vegetables sub-group that had been posting high price increases recently. Indeed, the seasonally adjusted data point to a 4.06% decline in fresh fruits and vegetables prices. 
3.    Energy prices increased by 2.20% in September, while annual inflation of the group increased by 2.05 points to 22.77%. The rise was mainly driven by increases in the prices of municipal water and in solid fuels such as coal and firewood. As a result of the rise in LPG prices, the SCT on which was nulled, fuel prices increased by 0.60%. The rise in propane and butane prices affected bottled gas prices adversely as well. 
4.    Core goods prices increased by 1.42% in September, while annual group inflation decreased by 0.90 points to 19.38%. Annual inflation declined in durable goods and clothing-footwear groups, while it remained flat in other core goods. Durable goods prices rose by 1.96% in September due to the increasing prices in the furniture group upon the expiry of special offers. While prices of white goods continued to increase in September, automobile prices registered a mild course. Despite the price hikes in durable goods, annual inflation in this subcategory declined by 2.09 points to 22.12% with the base effect. Meanwhile, the mild course in annual clothing and footwear inflation was maintained in September. 
5.    Services prices increased by 1.62% in September, and annual services inflation rose by 1.18 points to 15.06%. While annual inflation decreased in communication services, it increased in other subcategories, chiefly in transport services and restaurants-hotels. Services inflation has been affected adversely by the price increases in education-related sectors following the opening of schools and universities. The interruption of activities last year and the expiry of the temporary VAT cuts in education sector made the price increases in the mentioned items more evident. On the other hand, price increases seen in the restaurants-hotels group due to normalization steps and food prices persisted in September. Rent inflation seems to have gained some pace.
6.    According to recent issue of Survey of Market Participants, inflation expectations were revised upward in October. The current year-end inflation expectation rose by 0.89 points to 17.63%, while the 12-month ahead inflation expectation increased by 0.97 points to 13.91%. Currently, the 24-month ahead inflation expectation is 11.27% and the five-year ahead inflation expectation is 7.93%.
Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks 
7.    Despite the recovery in global economic activity in the first half of the year, recently published confidence indices have started to decline due to the effect of the pandemic. Economies advancing in their vaccination programs exhibit a stronger performance in economic activity by easing the restrictions. Nonetheless, despite the increase in the vaccination rate, new variants keep the downside risks to global economic activity alive.
8.    Recovery in global demand, high course of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors, and the rise in transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. Unfavorable effects of weather conditions in major agricultural commodity exporting countries are observed on global food prices. While the effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored, central banks in advanced economies assess that the rise in inflation will prove to be mostly temporary with the normalization in demand composition, easing of supply constraints, and waning base effects. Accordingly, central banks in advanced economies continue their supportive monetary stances and asset purchase programs.
9.    Emerging market debt securities markets have been witnessing outflows since the second half of September. The volatility in long-term bond rates in advanced economies and the course of global financial conditions keep the risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies alive. The impact of such risks through portfolio flows channel towards Turkey are judged to prove to be relatively limited, considering the current levels of non-residents’ portfolio positions. 
10.    International commodity prices, the lingering problems in supply chains and developments in the domestic energy sector continued to weigh on producer inflation in September. Subcategories that recorded the largest price hikes were transport vehicles, energy, paper, furniture, wood and cork products and fabricated metals. Prices increased at a relatively higher rate across subsectors of energy and sectors that rely heavily on basic metals. 
11.    Leading indicators show that domestic economic activity remains strong with the help of robust external demand. Industrial production grew by 5.4% percent month-on-month in August, compensating for the fall in July caused by transitory effects. Thus, in the third quarter industrial production rose by 1.2% quarter-on-quarter and remained on an upward trend. Turnover indices and survey-based data indicate that external demand continued to support industrial production in the third quarter. In this period, investment tendencies of manufacturing industry firms for the next twelve months are also getting stronger.
12.    The spread of domestic vaccination throughout the society facilitates the recovery in services, tourism and related sectors, which have been adversely affected by the pandemic, and leads to a more balanced composition in economic activity. The retail sales volume index registered a strong increase due to the reopening. The easing of restrictions, together with the strong vaccination momentum since June, played a role in the significant recovery trend in tourism and related services items. While the demand for durable consumer goods slows down, recovery is observed in non-durable consumer goods.
13.    In the July-August period, employment posted an increase led by the services sector, due to the reopening and the favorable course in tourism. In this period, non-farm employment and all its subcomponents exceeded pre-pandemic levels. Survey indicators and high-frequency data suggest that the improvement in the employment outlook and the positive course in the labor market continue thanks to the reopening and the course of economic activity.
14.    Favorable external demand conditions and current tight monetary policy impact the current account balance positively. The current account balance posted a surplus of USD 0.5 billion in August while it decreased by USD 4.6 billion to USD 23 billion in 12-month cumulative terms. Provisional foreign trade data suggest that seasonally adjusted exports and imports excluding gold registered a partial correction in September, being stronger in imports, and the exports to imports coverage ratio maintained its high levels. Meanwhile, the recovery trend in tourism revenues has become more evident. The improvement in annualized current account is expected to continue in the rest of the year due to the strong upward trend in exports, and the strengthening of this trend is important for the price stability objective.
Monetary Policy
15.    The monetary policy stance will be set by taking into account the evaluations on the source and permanence of risks, along with the extent to which they can be contained by monetary policy, and with a focus on bringing inflation down permanently in a cautious manner and achieving the price stability target. Accordingly, the policy stance will continue to be determined by taking into account inflation developments, inflation expectations, as well as the temporary factors projected to bear effect on these in the short term, and at a degree of tightness that will restore the disinflation process as soon as possible and ensure its sustainability until the medium-term targets are achieved.

It is assessed that these effects are due to transitory factors. On the other hand, the decelerating impact of the monetary tightening on credit and domestic demand is being observed. The tightness in monetary stance has started to have a higher than envisaged contractionary effect on commercial loans. In addition, strengthened macroprudential policy framework has started to curb personal loan growth. The Committee evaluated the analyses to decompose the impact of demand factors that monetary policy can have an effect on, core inflation developments and supply shocks. Accordingly, the Committee decided to reduce the policy rate by 200 basis points to 16 percent. Nevertheless, the Committee assessed that, till the end of the year, supply-side transitory factors leave limited room for the downward adjustment to the policy rate.
17.    In order to contain climate-based and other environmental risks, the Committee also decided to support sustainable finance initiatives as a long-term policy without prejudice to the main objectives of monetary policy.

Press Release on Reserve Requirements




In line with its main objective of price stability, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey revised the reserve requirement regulation to improve the effectiveness of monetary transmission mechanism.




The upper limits of the facilities for holding FX and standard gold for Turkish lira reserve requirements were gradually decreased through the steps taken before, and the facility for holding FX for Turkish lira reserve requirements was terminated on 1 October 2021.
This time, the upper limit of the facility for holding standard gold for Turkish lira reserve requirements has been decreased from 15% to 10%. This facility will be gradually decreased and terminated.
In addition, the reserve requirement ratios for FX deposits/participation funds have been increased by 200 basis points for all maturity brackets.
With these decisions, TL-denominated required reserves are expected to increase by approximately TRY 7.4 billion, and foreign currency required reserves are expected to increase by an equivalent of approximately USD 3.8 billion.
These changes will be effective from the calculation date of 28 October 2021 with the maintenance period starting on 12 November 2021.

The Committee evaluated the analyses to decompose the impact of demand factors that monetary policy can have an effect, core inflation developments and supply shocks and decided to reduce the policy rate by 100 basis points to 15 percent. The Committee expects that the transitory effects of supply-side factors and other factors beyond monetary policy’s control on price increases will persist through the first half of 2022. The Committee will consider to complete the use of the limited room implied by these factors in December.

Press Release on Market Developments
The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey implements floating exchange rate regime and has no commitment to any exchange rate level. Exchange rates are determined by supply and demand conditions according to free market dynamics. Under certain conditions, the Central Bank may only intervene in excessive volatility without aiming any permanent direction. In FX markets, unhealthy price formations are being observed that are unrealistic and completely detached from economic fundamentals.
The CBRT deemed it necessary to warn our companies and citizens against possible losses by trading at values completely detached from economic fundamentals under extremely volatile market conditions.

Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 18 November 2021
Inflation Developments
1. In October, consumer prices surged by 2.39%, and annual inflation rose by 0.31 points to 19.89%, mainly due to price hikes in energy and tobacco. In this period, international energy prices climbed, while domestic energy prices increased sharply coupled with the developments in Turkish lira. Tobacco prices soared due to higher price adjustments by tobacco firms for cigarettes, adding approximately 0.30 points to consumer inflation. Despite a slight drop, annual food inflation remained high. Producer inflation increased across subcategories due to developments in the Turkish lira, surging commodity prices and ongoing supply constraints. Accordingly, annual inflation in B and C indices fell slightly but recent trends remained high despite some deceleration.
2. Food and non-alcoholic beverages prices were up 1.92% in October, while annual inflation dropped by 1.38 points to 27.41% in this subcategory amid a high base from a year earlier. Annual inflation decreased to 29.20% and 25.71% in unprocessed food and processed food, respectively. Prices of fresh fruits and vegetables were the main driver of the decline in annual unprocessed food inflation. Meanwhile, the correction in fresh fruits and vegetables prices that started in September on a seasonally adjusted basis continued into this period on the back of prices of fresh fruits. In other unprocessed food group, price hikes were more notable for pulses, milk and potatoes due to an agricultural drought-driven yield loss, exchange rate developments and input costs. In processed food group, where widespread price increases occurred, bread and cereal prices accelerated further, by 3.16%, under pressure from the negative course of international and domestic wheat prices.
3. Energy prices jumped by 4.58% in October, while annual energy inflation rose by 2.99 points to 25.76%. In this period, international energy prices rose sharply in US dollar terms, while fuel, bottled gas and solid fuel prices recorded large monthly increases coupled with the developments in the Turkish lira.
4. Prices of core goods increased by 2.49% in October, and annual core goods inflation fell by 0.92 points to 18.46%. Annual inflation decreased in durable goods, remained flat in other core goods and increased in clothing and footwear. Prices of durable goods were up 1.23% in October on the back of white goods price increases, while the moderate course in furniture and automobile prices limited the monthly inflation in this subcategory. As a result, annual durable goods inflation decreased by 1.88 points to 20.24%. Rising at a lower rate than the seasonal average in October, clothing and footwear prices recorded higher annual inflation due to a pandemic-led low base from a year earlier. 
5. Services prices increased by 1.04% in October, and annual services inflation rose by 0.37 points to 15.43%. While annual inflation decreased in transport and other services, it remained flat in communication services, and increased in rent and restaurants-hotels. Due to the outlook of food prices and the expiry of the temporary VAT cuts, price hikes in the restaurants-hotels group continued in October and weighed on services inflation. Furthermore, rent inflation remained on an upward track in seasonally adjusted terms.
6. According to the Survey of Market Participants, inflation expectations continued to be revised upward in November. The current year-end inflation expectation rose by 1.68 points to 19.31%, while the 12-month ahead inflation expectation increased by 1.70 points to 15.61%. Currently, the 24-month ahead inflation expectation is 11.76% and the five-year ahead inflation expectation is 7.96%.
Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks 
7. Leading indicators show that the robust recovery in the global economy is sustained, albeit with some deceleration in certain regions. Confidence indices in US have recently declined due to the pandemic, while they have recorded a partial improvement in some European countries. Despite the recovery in global economic activity in the first half of the year and the increase in the vaccination rate, new variants keep the downside risks to global economic activity alive.
8. Recovery in global demand, the high course of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors and the rise in transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. Unfavorable effects of weather conditions in major agricultural commodity-exporting countries are observed on global food prices. While the effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored, central banks in advanced economies assess that the rise in inflation on the back of rising energy prices and imbalances between supply and demand may last longer than previously anticipated. However, many central banks are of the opinion that the increase in inflation is temporary, depending on the assessment that the increase in inflation is due to transitory factors. Accordingly, central banks in advanced economies continue their supportive monetary stances and asset purchase programs.
9. Emerging market debt securities markets have witnessed fluctuations, while there have been inflows to equity markets since the second half of October. The volatility in long-term bond rates in advanced economies and the course of global financial conditions keep the risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies alive. The impact of such risks through portfolio flows channel towards Turkey are judged to prove to be relatively limited, considering the current levels of non-residents’ portfolio positions. 
10. Producer inflation increased in October due to the outlook of the Turkish lira, the ongoing rise in commodity prices, with energy in the lead, and supply constraints. Price hikes were registered across the index, while the largest price increases took place in energy group, particularly in refined petroleum products, gas production, water and coal. Among intermediate goods, another subcategory with high price increases, mainly metal-related groups, textile-related items, sewing thread and fibers, basic chemicals as well as plastic and paper products stood out.
11. Leading indicators show that domestic economic activity remains strong with the help of robust external demand. Industrial production declined by 1.5% percent month-on-month on account of the items that recorded historical fluctuations and interruption in production led by supply disruptions in September. However, in the third quarter, industrial production rose by 1.6% quarter-on-quarter and remained on an upward trend. Turnover indices indicate that external demand continued to support industrial production in the third quarter. Investment tendencies of manufacturing industry firms for the next twelve months continue to strengthen.
12. The spread of domestic vaccination throughout the society facilitates the recovery in services, tourism and related sectors, which have been adversely affected by the pandemic, and leads to a more balanced composition in economic activity. The retail sales volume and services turnover indices registered a strong increase in the third quarter thanks particularly to tourism-related sectors. The easing of restrictions, together with the strong vaccination momentum, played a role in the significant recovery trend in tourism and related services items. While the demand for durable consumer goods slows down, recovery continues in non-durable consumer goods.
13. The course of employment in the third quarter was in line with the rebalancing in the economic activity underpinned by the recovery in tourism and strong exports. The increase in non-farm employment compared to the previous quarter accelerated and became 2.5% in the third quarter. Meanwhile, services employment increased by 3.0% quarter-on-quarter driven by restaurants-hotels and retail trade sectors and manufacturing and construction sectors also contributed to the increase in employment. Despite the increase in the labor force participation rate, the unemployment rate decreased to 11.5% in September owing to the strong increase in employment. Survey indicators and high-frequency data suggest that the improvement in the employment outlook and the positive course in the labor market continue.
14. Favorable external demand conditions impact the current account balance positively. The current account balance posted a surplus of USD 1.7 billion in September while it decreased by USD 4 billion to USD 18.4 billion in 12-month cumulative terms. Provisional foreign trade data suggest that seasonally adjusted exports and imports excluding gold rose in October, being stronger in exports, and the exports to imports coverage ratio increased. Meanwhile, the recovery trend in tourism revenues became more evident. The improvement in annualized current account is expected to continue in the rest of the year due to the strong upward trend in exports, and the strengthening of this trend is important for the price stability objective.
Monetary Policy
15. The monetary policy stance will be set by taking into account the evaluations on the source and permanence of risks, along with the extent to which they can be contained by monetary policy, and with a focus on bringing inflation down permanently in a cautious manner and achieving the price stability target. Accordingly, the policy stance will continue to be determined by taking into account inflation developments, inflation expectations, as well as the temporary factors projected to bear effect on these in the short term, and at a degree of tightness that will restore the disinflation process as soon as possible and ensure its sustainability until the medium-term targets are achieved. 
16. Recent increase in inflation has been driven by supply-side factors such as rise in food and import prices, especially in energy, and supply constraints, increase in administered prices and demand developments. The revision in the monetary policy stance began to affect commercial loans positively. In addition, developments in consumer loans are closely monitored. The Committee evaluated the analyses to decompose the impact of demand factors that monetary policy can have an effect, core inflation developments and supply shocks and decided to reduce the policy rate by 100 basis points to 15 percent. The Committee expects that the transitory effects of supply-side factors and other factors beyond monetary policy’s control on price increases will persist through the first half of 2022. The Committee will consider to complete the use of the limited room implied by these factors in December.
17. In order to limit the risks arising from climate-based and other environmental risks, the CBRT decided to establish a new unit called the “Green Economy and Climate Change Division”, within the scope of its decision to support sustainable finance practices as a long-term policy without prejudice to the main objectives of monetary policy. It is aimed that the said unit will carry out studies in order to identify the vulnerabilities and opportunities that climate change may create in the financial system and to reduce related risks. 
18. Inflation is expected to follow a volatile course in the short term due to various supply and demand-side factors, with commodity prices and administered prices in the lead. However, a sufficiently tight monetary stance to ensure the return of inflation to its downward trend once temporary effects disappear, will serve as a significant buffer against external and temporary volatilities in the context of inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and financial market developments.
19. The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target  is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability.  
20. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way. 
21. Demand and cost-side effects are closely monitored for inflation given the developments in the credit market, economic activity, supply-side factors, and import prices. The outlook for monetary policies in advanced economies and the global risk appetite heighten the risks to portfolio flows towards emerging economies. In formulating the monetary policy towards achieving the price stability objective, the Committee will continue to follow an approach that also addresses risks to financial stability. In this context, the effect of macroprudential policies on credit and the CBRT funding’s composition between OMO and swap transactions are closely monitored.
22. The Committee reiterated that in order to achieve price stability, strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders are required.
23. The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework."

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 15 percent to 14 percent.
The reintroduction of travel restrictions and lockdowns due to the new variants keeps the downside risks to global economic activity alive and raises the uncertainty. Recovery in global demand, high course of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors and rise in transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. While the effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored, central banks in advanced economies assess that the rise in inflation on the back of rising energy prices and imbalances between supply and demand may last longer than previously anticipated. Accordingly, while monetary policy communication of central banks in advanced economies varies with their diverse outlook for economic activity, labor market and inflation expectations, they continue their supportive monetary stances and asset purchase programs.
National income data and leading indicators show that domestic economic activity remains strong, with the help of robust external demand. The spread of domestic vaccination throughout the society facilitates the recovery in services, tourism and related sectors, which have been adversely affected by the pandemic, and leads to a more balanced composition in economic activity. Current account balance is expected to post a surplus in 2022 due to the strengthening of the upward trend in exports. Strengthening of the improvement trend in current account balance is important for price stability objective, and in that respect, developments in commercial and consumer loans are closely monitored.
Increase in inflation in November has been driven by developments in exchange rates and supply side factors such as the rise in global food and agricultural commodity prices, supply constraints, and demand developments. The Committee decided to complete the use of the limited room implied by transitory effects of supply-side factors and other factors beyond monetary policy’s control on price increases and reduced the policy rate by 100 basis points. Cumulative impact of the recent policy decisions will be monitored in the first quarter of 2022 and during this period, all aspects of the policy framework will be reassessed in order to create a foundation for a sustainable price stability.
The CBRT will continue to use decisively all available instruments until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way.
The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework.

23 December 2021
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date:16 December 2021
Inflation Developments
1.    In November, consumer prices surged by 3.51%, and annual inflation rose by 1.42 points to 21.31%, with prices of energy and services in the lead. Despite the price hikes in food and core goods, annual inflation edged down due to the base effect. Exchange rate developments, the upsurge in domestic energy prices, the ongoing adverse course of international commodity prices and resurging supply constraints drove producer prices considerably upwards. Against this background, annual inflation in B and C indices as well as their recent trends increased.
2.    In November, prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 3.92%, and the group’s annual inflation fell by 0.30 points to 27.11% due to the high base effect. Annual inflation rose to 28.86% in the processed food group, but dropped to 25.22% in the unprocessed food group. The decline in the unprocessed food inflation was mainly driven by the prices in the fresh fruits-vegetables subcategory. In this period, prices of vegetables declined amid favorable weather conditions, and annual inflation fell considerably in the fresh fruit-vegetables group due also to the high base effect. In other unprocessed food group, price hikes were more notable for meat, eggs, potatoes, nuts and pulses due to exchange rate developments and input costs. In the processed food group, monthly price increases accelerated. The hike in bread and cereal prices of 7.20% was notable, which was led by the agricultural drought, the adverse course of international wheat prices and exchange rate developments. Among other processed food items, negative divergences were seen in the processed meat products due to meat prices, and fats-oils as well as sugar and sugar-related product groups due to international oil prices. Consequently, annual inflation in the food group excluding fresh fruits and vegetables increased by 2.23 points to 29.76%.
3.    In November, energy prices increased by 5.95%, while annual energy inflation surged by 6.38 points to 32.14%. In this period, international energy prices eased somewhat, domestic energy prices moved higher amid the developments in the Turkish lira. Items that stood out with large price increases were solid fuels, bottled gas and fuel.
4.    Core goods prices increased by 3.67% in November, and annual core goods inflation fell by 0.10 points to 18.36% due to the base effect. While annual inflation decreased in durable goods, it remained almost flat in the clothing and footwear group and increased in other core goods. Prices of durable consumption goods rose by 4.06% month-on-month, led by automobiles, furniture and white goods, but annual inflation in this group declined thanks to the base effect. While prices in the clothing and footwear group posted an increase below seasonal averages in November, annual inflation in this group remained flat on account of the base effect driven by the pandemic in the same period last year. Prices of other core goods posted broad-based increases in line with exchange rate developments. 
5.    Services prices increased by 1.88% in November, and annual services inflation rose by 1.45 points to 16.88%. Annual inflation increased across all subcategories led by restaurants-hotels. The restaurants-hotels subcategory posted price increases due to both catering and accommodation services, and diverged significantly from the other services groups on account of high inflation. In this period, catering services prices increased by 4.24% month-on-month due to the adverse course of food prices. It is considered that catering services were adversely affected by the prices of bread-cereal products, and meat and meat products in particular. The other services subcategories that stood out in this period were rents and repair services. In addition to insurance services, the maintenance and repair services with high exchange rate sensitivity diverged negatively in the other services group. According to seasonally adjusted data, the upward trend in rent inflation continued in November.
6.    According to the Survey of Market Participants, inflation expectations continued to be revised upward. The current year-end inflation expectation rose by 4.54 points to 23.85%, while the 12-month ahead inflation expectation increased by 5.78 points to 21.39%. The long-term data indicate that the five-year ahead inflation expectation increased by 0.76 points to 8.72%.   
Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks
7.    Leading indicators show that the robust recovery in the global economy is sustained, albeit to varying degrees across regions. Confidence indices in the US have recently declined due to the pandemic, while they have recorded a partial improvement in some European countries. Despite the recovery in global economic activity and the increase in the vaccination rate, the reintroduction of travel restrictions and lockdowns due to new variants keeps the downside risks to global economic activity alive and raises the uncertainty. 
8.    Recovery in global demand, high course of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors and rise in transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. While the effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored, central banks in advanced economies assess that the rise in inflation on the back of rising energy prices and imbalances between supply and demand may last longer than previously anticipated. Accordingly, while monetary policy communication of central banks in advanced economies varies with their diverse outlook for economic activity, labor market and inflation expectations, they continue their supportive monetary stances and asset purchase programs. 
9.    Emerging market debt securities markets continue to experience outflows, while there have been inflows to equity markets. The volatility in long-term bond rates in advanced economies and the course of global financial conditions keep the risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies alive. The impact of such risks through portfolio flows channel towards Turkey are judged to prove to be relatively limited, considering the current levels of non-residents’ portfolio positions. 
10.    In November, producer prices increased by 9.99% and annual producer inflation reached 54.62%. Price increases were widespread, and the trend of manufacturing industry prices excluding oil and base metals increased significantly. Exchange rate developments, unfavorable price movements in international agricultural commodity products, rising domestic energy costs and renewed supply issues were the main factors driving producer prices up in November.
11.    In the third quarter, Gross Domestic Product increased by 7.4% year-on-year and 2.7% quarter-on-quarter on the back of the easing of restrictions and the significant recovery trend in tourism following the strong vaccination momentum. On the production side, industrial and services sectors were the main drivers of annual and quarterly growth, while construction and agricultural sectors imposed a drag on quarterly growth. On the expenditure side, the main driver of quarterly growth was domestic demand. The increasing contribution of domestic demand stemmed from private consumption expenditures due to the recovery in the pandemic-stricken sectors following the reopening. The annual growth in machinery-equipment investments remained high at 17.5%. There was an increase in both exports and imports on a quarterly basis, while the contribution of net exports to quarterly growth was limited to 0.1 percentage points, contribution to annual growth was 6.8 percentage points. 
12.    Leading indicators show that domestic economic activity remains strong, with the help of robust external demand. In October, the Industrial Production Index (IPI) increased by 0.6% month-on-month and by 5.4% year-on-year in seasonally and calendar-adjusted terms. Thus, the IPI rose by 1.5% relative to the third quarter, maintaining its upward trend also in the final quarter. Excluding the sectors that experience historically high fluctuations, other transport vehicles in particular, the monthly increase in industrial production, led by non-durable goods, is stronger than the headline value. As of November, investment tendencies of manufacturing industry firms for the next twelve months remain high.
13.    The spread of domestic vaccination throughout the society facilitates the recovery in services, tourism and related sectors, which have been adversely affected by the pandemic, and leads to a more balanced composition in economic activity. The retail sales volume and services turnover indices continue to increase thanks particularly to tourism-related sectors. On the other hand, the recovery trend in non-durable consumer goods is maintained.  
14.    The improvement in the labor market continues in line with the economic activity outlook. In October, employment remained on an upward trend led by the services sector on the back of the reopening and the favorable course in tourism, while the labor force participation rate posted a limited increase. Accordingly, the seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate further declined to 11.2%. Survey indicators and high-frequency data suggest that the improvement in the employment outlook and the positive course in the labor market continue.
15.    Favorable external demand conditions impact the current account balance positively. The current account balance posted a surplus of USD 3.2 billion in October while it decreased by USD 3.2 billion to USD 15.4 billion in 12-month cumulative terms. Provisional foreign trade data suggest that exports remained strong in November, and imports rose due also to the large increase in energy imports. Despite this outlook in the foreign trade balance, the favorable course in services revenues continues to support the current account balance. The current account balance is expected to post a surplus in 2022 due to the strengthening of the upward trend in exports. Strengthening of the improvement trend in the current account balance is important for the price stability objective, and in this respect, developments in commercial and consumer loans are closely monitored. 
Monetary Policy
16.    The monetary policy stance will be set by taking into account the evaluations on the source and permanence of risks, along with the extent to which they can be contained by monetary policy, and with a focus on bringing inflation down permanently in a cautious manner and achieving the price stability target. Accordingly, the policy stance will continue to be determined by taking into account inflation developments, inflation expectations, as well as the temporary factors projected to bear effect on these in the short term, and at a degree of tightness that will restore the disinflation process as soon as possible and ensure its sustainability until the medium-term targets are achieved. 
17.    Increase in inflation in November has been driven by developments in exchange rates and supply side factors such as the rise in global food and agricultural commodity prices, supply constraints, and demand developments. The Committee decided to complete the use of the limited room implied by transitory effects of supply-side factors and other factors beyond monetary policy’s control on price increases and reduced the policy rate by 100 basis points. Cumulative impact of the recent policy decisions will be monitored in the first quarter of 2022 and during this period, all aspects of the policy framework will be reassessed in order to create a foundation for a sustainable price stability.
18.    Inflation is expected to follow a volatile course in the short term due to various supply and demand-side factors, with exchange rates, commodity prices and administered prices in the lead. However, a monetary stance to ensure the return of inflation to its downward trend once temporary effects disappear, will serve as a significant buffer against external and temporary volatilities in the context of inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and financial market developments.
19.    The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability.
20.    Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way. 
21.    Demand and cost-side effects are closely monitored for inflation given the developments in the credit market, economic activity, supply-side factors, and import prices. The outlook for monetary policies in advanced economies and the global risk appetite heighten the risks to portfolio flows towards emerging economies. In formulating the monetary policy towards achieving the price stability objective, the Committee will continue to follow an approach that also addresses risks to financial stability. In this context, the effect of macroprudential policies on credit and the CBRT funding’s composition between OMO and swap transactions are closely monitored.
22.    The Committee reiterated that in order to achieve price stability, strong policy coordination and a holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders are required.
23.    The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework."

Decision of the Monetary Policy Committee
Participating Committee Members
Murat Uysal (Governor), Murat Çetinkaya, Ömer Duman, Uğur Namık Küçük, Oğuzhan Özbaş, Emrah Şener, Abdullah Yavaş.
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 12 percent to 11.25 percent.
Recent data indicate that recovery in economic activity continues. Sectoral diffusion of economic activity continues to improve. However, investment demand remains weak. While favorable effects of improved competitiveness prevail, weakening global economic outlook tempers external demand. As the contribution of net exports to economic growth declines, economic recovery is expected to be sustained with the help of the ongoing disinflation process and improvement in financial conditions. Current account balance, which has recently recorded significant improvement, is expected to maintain a moderate course with the contribution of supportive policy measures.
Weakness in global economic activity and low levels of global inflation strengthen expectations regarding the continuation of expansionary monetary policies in advanced economies. Current global financial conditions and the recent partial improvement in expectations regarding global trade support the demand for emerging market assets and the risk appetite. Nevertheless, rising protectionism, uncertainty regarding global economic policies and geopolitical developments are closely monitored for their impact on capital flows, international trade and commodity prices.
Inflation outlook continued to improve and inflation expectations sustained their wide-spread decline. The improvement in macroeconomic indicators, inflation in particular, supports the fall in country risk premium and helps contain cost pressures. Developments in the exchange rate, domestic demand conditions and producer prices have contributed to a mild trend in core inflation indicators. The course of inflation is considered to be broadly in line with the year-end inflation projection. Accordingly, considering all factors affecting the inflation outlook, the Committee decided to make a measured cut in the policy rate. At this point, the current monetary policy stance remains consistent with the projected disinflation path.
The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is a key factor for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, monetary stance will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

23 January 2020
Press Release on Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 16 January 2020
Inflation Developments
1. In December, consumer prices increased by 0.74% while annual inflation rose by 28 points to 11.84%, slightly below the forecast presented in the October Inflation Report. In this period, while annual inflation rose across subgroups, the rise in the services group remained more limited. Energy inflation posted the most noticeable increase in December due to the low base effect from the same period last year. Food inflation remained on the rise driven by both unprocessed and processed food subcategories. Annual inflation in core goods increased due to cost factors as well as the low base effect from the same period last year. Against this background, although annual inflation in core indicators was slightly up, B and C indices maintained their mild trend.
2. Annual inflation in the food and non-alcoholic beverages group rose by 2.00 points to 10.89% in December. This rise was mainly driven by price movements in the processed food group. While price developments in dairy products were noticeable following the increases in purchasing prices of raw milk, the recent uptrend in bread and cereals prices continued. The rise in unprocessed food inflation in December was mainly driven by the other unprocessed food group, while inflation in fresh vegetables and fruits posted a limited increase and remained low at the year-end. Leading indicators signal that despite significant increases in vegetable prices, unprocessed food inflation may slow down in January due to the base effect.
3. Energy prices inched up by 0.16%, while annual energy inflation increased by 64 points to 10.98% due to base effects in December. This increase is attributed to the hikes in bottled gas and fuel prices driven by the rise in oil prices and the recent exchange rate developments. The sliding-scale tariff in fuel prices and the decline in municipal water prices limited a more adverse outlook in energy prices. It should be noted that annual inflation in the energy group will also rise significantly in January due to base effects.
4. Annual core goods inflation increased by 0.91 points to 7.48% in December, partly due to the low base effect from the same period last year. In this period, annual inflation increased in clothing and durable goods but slightly decreased in other core goods. The increase in durable goods prices is attributable to depreciation of the Turkish lira. Although clothing and footwear prices posted a more limited decline compared to seasonal averages in December, annual inflation in this group remained significantly low. All in all, the trend of core goods inflation remained almost flat.
5. Services prices increased by 0.37% in December, and annual services inflation rose by 0.14 points to 12.30%. Annual inflation increased slightly in communication and other services, but declined in transport services and remained almost flat in restaurants-hotels services and rents. The underlying trend of services inflation also inched down. In the upcoming period, the real unit labor costs stemming from minimum wage developments, the tourism demand and the backward-indexation behavior are envisaged to shape the outlook for services prices.
6. The improvement in inflation expectations continues. The downtrend in the medium-term inflation expectations continues to be widespread and the distribution of expectations implies an increased consensus among survey participants, which indicates that uncertainties regarding the medium-term inflation outlook have significantly decreased.
Factors Affecting Inflation
7. Recent data indicate that moderate recovery in economic activity continues. Industrial production posted a month-on-month increase in November and remained on a path of recovery with a rise of 0.7% in the October-November period compared to the previous quarter. Underlying trend in industrial production is stronger after adjusting for temporary fluctuations in sectors with high historical volatility. Survey indicators and foreign trade data indicate that the uptrend in industrial production will continue in December as well.
8. The decline in risk premium and exchange rate volatility as well as the improvement in financial conditions supported domestic demand considerably in the last quarter. Despite the weakness in the labor market, private consumption has been increasing on the back of postponed demand. In addition, public expenditures continued to boost growth through the consumption channel.
9. Sectoral diffusion of economic activity continues to improve. Survey indicators such as the CBRT Business Tendency Survey, PMI and sectoral confidence indices hint at an ongoing increase in the manufacturing industry and services activities. Although investment remains weak, tendencies for investment and employment including that of small and medium-sized firms are recovering. The Committee emphasized the importance of stable growth and demand for a sustainable improvement in investment and employment.
10. While favorable effects of improved competitiveness prevail, weakening global economic outlook tempers external demand. In addition to the EU, signals for a slowdown in MENA countries increased in this period. While flexibility in market diversification and strong course in tourism support exports of goods and services, the recovery in domestic demand stimulates imports. Against this background, in the last quarter of the year, it is expected that the contribution of net exports to economic growth will decline, and the current account balance, which has recently recorded a significant improvement, will maintain a moderate course with the contribution of supportive policy measures.
11. The labor market data for the October period indicate an increase in nonfarm employment including the construction sector as well, and a decline in the unemployment rate. Compared to the previous period, industrial and construction employment posted an upsurge, while the rise in services employment remained limited. Leading indicators signal that the partial improvement in unemployment rates continues, while the weakness in the labor market prevails.
12. In sum, in the upcoming period, as the contribution of net exports to economic growth declines, economic recovery is expected to be sustained with the help of the ongoing disinflation process and improvement in financial conditions.
Monetary Policy and Risks
13. Global economic activity remains weak in both advanced and emerging market economies. The Phase 1 trade deal between the US and China partially improved the expectations that global trade tensions could ease. Nevertheless, with high tariffs still in place, many issues unresolved and uncertainty over the fulfillment of commitments, trade disputes keep the downside risks to global economic activity alive. The resulting likely effects on domestic growth are monitored closely.
14. Crude oil prices have been more volatile and risen significantly since the previous MPC meeting due to recent geopolitical developments. However, sluggish global economic activity weighs on commodity prices. Thus, after an uptick in the fourth quarter, global headline inflation is expected to remain flat in 2020.
15. Weakness in global economic activity and low levels of global inflation strengthen expectations regarding the continuation of expansionary monetary policies in advanced economies. The expectation that recently adopted accommodative stance of monetary policies in advanced economies, the US in particular, is likely to be maintained over a medium term horizon under current circumstances, and its implications for global financial conditions have paved the way for expansionary policies in emerging market economies as well. Current global financial conditions and the recent partial improvement in expectations regarding global trade support the demand for emerging market assets and the risk appetite. Accordingly, portfolio flows towards emerging economies have presented a more favorable outlook compared to the previous meeting period. Nevertheless, rising protectionism, uncertainty regarding global economic policies and geopolitical developments are closely monitored for their impact on capital flows, international trade and commodity prices.
16. Turkey’s country risk premium continued to decline owing to a cautious monetary policy stance and improved macroeconomic indicators as well as the accommodative monetary policies in advanced economies. However, upside risks regarding global and geopolitical uncertainties on the medium-term inflation outlook through country risk premium and exchange rate volatility channels will continue to be monitored closely.
17. The strong rate cuts since July, lower inflation expectations and improved banking liquidity helped bring loan and deposit rates further down. Thus, TL-denominated loans, consumer loans in particular, remained on the rise thanks to improved financing conditions and recovering domestic demand. This rise can be attributed to supply-side effects caused by expectations for the overall economic outlook as well as postponed loan demand and loan restructuring.
18. The more flexible and effective use of required reserves as a countercyclical macroprudential tool in this period supports credit growth and financial stability. The aim of the reserve requirement practice introduced on 9 December 2019 was to channel credit supply towards production-oriented sectors rather than consumption and encourage the use of long-term commercial loans that have a strong relation with production and investment, and long-term mortgage loans that have a weak relation with imports. In the upcoming period, with the improvement in liquidity and capital adequacy ratios of the banking sector, the fall in interest rates and adjustments in required reserves are expected to further support credit growth. In addition, NPLs and Stage 2 loans are monitored closely for any impact they might have on banks’ loan supply in the short term. Employment and income developments will determine the persistence of recent rate cut-driven rebound in loan demand. The pace, scope and sustainability of normalization in credit conditions will be important for the outlook for economic activity.
19. Inflation outlook continued to improve and inflation expectations sustained their wide-spread decline. The improvement in macroeconomic indicators, inflation in particular, supports the fall in country risk premium and helps contain cost pressures. Developments in the exchange rate, domestic demand conditions and producer prices have contributed to a mild trend in core inflation indicators. The course of inflation is considered to be broadly in line with the year-end inflation projection. Accordingly, considering all factors affecting the inflation outlook, the Committee decided to make a measured cut in the policy rate. At this point, the current monetary policy stance remains consistent with the projected disinflation path.
20. The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is a key for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, monetary stance will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives.
21. The Committee emphasized the importance of sustaining the improvement in the country risk premium for the price and financial stability objectives. In this context, in order to support the effectiveness of the monetary policy and minimize a likely inflation-growth trade-off, it will be crucial that macro-financial policies are determined with a focus on reducing financial volatility and risk premium, and that the predictability of the fiscal policy continues to be reinforced.
22. The fiscal policy outlook that the monetary policy is based on incorporates a policy stance that focuses on price stability and macroeconomic rebalancing and that is coordinated with the monetary policy. Accordingly, the monetary policy stance assumes that administered price and tax adjustments are formulated in a way that will help reduce the backward indexation behavior. If the fiscal policy significantly deviates from this framework leading to an adverse impact on the medium-term inflation outlook, the monetary policy stance may be revised.
23. Collective efforts to turn the recently enhanced coordination between monetary and fiscal policies into a sustained and systematic framework are expected to support the achievement of price stability. Moreover, continued structural steps focusing on reducing rigidity and volatility in inflation will contribute to price stability and therefore social welfare.
24. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance."

2020,10 February 2020,Press Release on Fees That Banks Can Charge Commercial Clients,"No: 2020-07
10 February 2020
Press Release on Fees That Banks Can Charge Commercial Clients
Fees that banks can charge their commercial clients for products and services, offered under four categories as “Commercial Loans”, “Foreign Trade”, “Cash Management” and “Payment Systems”, have been limited to 51 items.
Pursuant to the Council of Ministers Decision No. 2006/11188, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey issued the “Communiqué No. 2006/1 on the Deposit and Loan Rates, the Profit and Loss Participation Rates for Participation Accounts, and Other Non-Interest Benefits to be Received via Credit Transactions”. Article 4 of this Communiqué stipulates that the characteristics and limits of other non-interest benefits to be received and charges to be collected shall be determined freely. However, it was observed over time that banks collect numerous fees, commissions and charges of the same characteristic under different names, and the collected amounts are far from being comparable and might lead to overcharging. Consequently, client complaints have increased significantly.
Therefore, the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA) issued the “Regulation on Procedures and Principles Regarding the Fees to be Charged on Financial Consumers” on 3 October 2014, which simplified the fees that can be charged on financial consumers, and ensured transparency in charges. However, problems persisted regarding the charges imposed on commercial clients.
Following comprehensive evaluations, it has been decided to make a regulation to render the fees that can be collected more transparent, lucid and comparable by determining the types and characteristics, maximum amounts or rates of fees that banks can charge their commercial clients for products and services as well as the standards thereof. To this end, the “Communiqué No. 2020/4 on Procedures and Principles Regarding the Fees That Banks Can Charge Their Commercial Clients” has been published.
In this Communiqué,

Fees that banks can charge their commercial clients for products and services, offered under the four categories as “Commercial Loans”, “Foreign Trade”, “Cash Management” and “Payment Systems”, have been limited to 51 items,
Quantitative or qualitative restrictions have been introduced to some fee items,
Obligation to inform has been imposed on banks for transparency purposes.

Provisions in the Communiqué shall be effective as of 1 March 2020. These provisions shall also apply to transactions to be conducted after the effective date under the contracts made before this date.
The amounts and rates limited in the Communiqué are upper limits, and the fees and rates to be applied will certainly be determined by competitive market conditions as well as by the business relations between banks and commercial clients.
Moreover, it has been decided to repeal the Communiqué No. 2006/1 on 1 March 2020 and to replace it with the “Communiqué No. 2020/3 on the Deposit and Loan Rates and the Profit and Loss Participation Rates for Participation Accounts”, to be effective 1 March 2020. With the Communiqué No. 2020/3, the provisions of the repealed Communiqué excluding those on other non-interest benefits to be received are broadly preserved, and provisions are changed regarding the profit and loss participation rates to be applied in participation accounts, taking into account the BRSA regulations and international interest-free finance principles and guidelines.

Decision of the Monetary Policy Committee
Participating Committee Members
Murat Uysal (Governor), Murat Çetinkaya, Ömer Duman, Uğur Namık Küçük, Oğuzhan Özbaş, Emrah Şener, Abdullah Yavaş.
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 11.25 percent to 10.75 percent.
Recent data indicate that recovery in economic activity continues. Sectoral diffusion of economic activity continues to improve. Despite signs of recovery, investment and employment remain weak. While favorable effects of improved competitiveness prevail, weakening global economic outlook tempers external demand. As the contribution of net exports to economic growth declines, economic recovery is expected to be sustained with the help of the ongoing disinflation process and improvement in financial conditions. Nevertheless, developments in credit growth and its composition are closely monitored for their impact on external balance and inflation. Going forward, sustaining a moderate course in current account balance, which has recently recorded significant improvement, is considered as a crucial element of the macroeconomic policy mix.
Weakness in global economic activity and low levels of global inflation strengthen expectations regarding the continuation of expansionary monetary policies in advanced economies. On the other hand, recently elevated uncertainties regarding global economic outlook lead to volatility in the demand for emerging market assets and the risk appetite. Rising protectionism, uncertainty regarding global economic policies, geopolitical developments and the recent outbreak of an epidemic disease are closely monitored for their impact on capital flows, international trade and commodity prices.
Developments in inflation expectations, domestic demand conditions and producer prices have contributed to a mild trend in core inflation indicators. The improvement in macroeconomic indicators, inflation in particular, supports the fall in country risk premium and helps contain cost pressures. The course of inflation is considered to be broadly in line with the year-end inflation projection. Accordingly, considering all factors affecting the inflation outlook, the Committee decided to make a more measured cut in the policy rate. At this point, the current monetary policy stance remains consistent with the projected disinflation path.

Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, monetary stance will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives.

26 February 2020
Press Release on Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 19 February 2020
Inflation Developments
1. In January, consumer prices rose by 1.35%, while annual inflation increased by 0.31 points to 12.15%. Annual inflation declined across the main groups excluding energy, and the surge in energy inflation stemmed from the low base from the same period of the previous year. In this period, B and C indicators recorded a relatively flat annual inflation, but a slight increase in trends.
2. In January, annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages fell by 1.85 points to 9.04%. Led by fresh fruits and vegetables, unprocessed food prices surged on a seasonal basis, yet the group’s annual inflation dropped due to the high base, limiting the food inflation. Meanwhile, processed food prices remained on an upward track in January, driven mainly by the bread-cereals and dairy products.
3. Energy prices rose by 1.11% in January. Annual energy inflation rose by 6.16 points to 17.14% due to the low base effect led by the reduced prices in electricity, natural gas and municipal water in the same period of the previous year. Monthly price increases were shaped by the rise in municipal water tariffs and increased fuel prices due to exchange rate developments notwithstanding the fall in international oil prices. Leading indicators for February signal that the group’s annual inflation will decline due to fuel prices. Meanwhile, in February, tobacco prices of the food and non-alcoholic beverages group registered a decline.
4. Annual core goods inflation decreased by 0.13 points to 7.35% in January. In this period, annual inflation dropped in durable goods, rose in clothing and footwear group and remained flat in other core goods. The VAT reduction in furniture products was largely transmitted into prices, pulling down the prices of durable goods in January. All in all, the underlying trend of core goods inflation remained mild.
5. Services prices increased by 2.00% and annual services inflation inched down to 12.20% in January. In this period, annual inflation declined in rents, transport services and communication but crept up in restaurants-hotels and remained relatively flat in other services. According to the monthly price developments, price hikes seen in the other services group items that are inclined to backward-indexation, that reflect the exchange rate effect, and whose prices are set according to the re-valuation rate were noteworthy. The underlying trend of services inflation increased slightly in this period.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6. Recent data indicate that recovery in economic activity continues. Industrial production posted a month-on-month surge in December and rose by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter. Survey indicators signal that the strong course in production will also continue in January.
7. The decline in risk premium, fading uncertainties and the rebound in loans support domestic demand, and the sectoral diffusion of economic activity continues to improve. Despite signs of recovery due to falling loan rates and improving prospects for the overall economy, investment and employment remain weak. The Committee emphasized the importance of growth and demand stability for a sustainable improvement in investment and employment.
8. While favorable effects of improved competitiveness prevail, weakening global economic outlook tempers external demand. The European region’s PMI indicators have recently signaled a partial improvement in the growth outlook, with Germany and the UK in the lead. In addition to this improvement in external demand, new market gains also affected exports positively. However, the re-emergence of downside risks to global growth due to the epidemic in China raises the uncertainties over the external demand outlook. Meanwhile, the recovery in domestic demand stimulates imports and the contribution of net exports to economic growth declines. Although the current account balance follows a moderate course, the effect of the developments in the demand composition and the epidemic are monitored closely.
9. The recovery in labor market continues as the economic activity grows stronger. Compared to the previous period, non-agricultural employment increased driven by industrial sector in November period and unemployment rates continued to decrease. The leading indicators signal that the decline in unemployment rates continued in the first quarter of 2020 as well.
10. In sum, as the contribution of net exports to economic growth declines, economic recovery is expected to be sustained with the help of the ongoing disinflation process and improvement in financial conditions.
Monetary Policy and Risks
11. Weakness in global economic activity continues both in advanced and emerging economies. Global economic activity presents a favorable outlook on the back of the favorable developments towards settlement of trade tensions between the US and China, dissipating Brexit-related uncertainties and the ongoing accommodative stance in global monetary policies. Nevertheless, aggravated geopolitical tensions in January, social unrest in some emerging markets, drought in the southern hemisphere and concerns over the epidemic that broke out in China keep downside risks to global economic activity in place. The likely impact of the listed factors on domestic growth are closely monitored.
12. Weak global economic activity coupled with more apparent downside risks repress commodity prices and lead to a mild course in oil prices despite supply-side problems stemming from geopolitical developments. In this respect, global inflation is expected to remain flat in 2020.
13. Weakness in global economic activity and low levels of global inflation strengthen expectations regarding the continuation of expansionary monetary policies in advanced economies. On the other hand, recently elevated uncertainties regarding global economic outlook lead to volatility in the demand for emerging market assets and the risk appetite. Rising protectionism, uncertainty regarding global economic policies, geopolitical developments and the recent outbreak of an epidemic disease are closely monitored for their impact on capital flows, international trade and commodity prices.
14. The cautious monetary policy stance, the improvement in macroeconomic indicators, and accommodative monetary policies in advanced economies have positively affected Turkey’s country risk premium. However, upside risks to the medium-term inflation outlook that may be triggered by global and geopolitical uncertainties through the country risk premium and exchange rate volatility channels will continue to be monitored closely.
15. The strong rate cuts since July, lower inflation expectations and improved banking liquidity helped bring loan and deposit rates further down. Thus, TL-denominated loans, consumer loans in particular, remained on the rise thanks to improved financing conditions and recovering domestic demand. This rise can be attributed to supply-side effects caused by expectations for the overall economic outlook as well as postponed loan demand and loan restructuring. Nevertheless, developments in credit growth and its composition are closely monitored for their impact on external balance and inflation. Going forward, sustaining a moderate course in the current account balance, which has recently recorded significant improvement, is considered as a crucial element of the macroeconomic policy mix. Accordingly, the Committee assessed that macroprudential measures addressing credit growth and its composition might be reviewed to safeguard the achievements in the current account balance for price stability and financial stability objectives.
16. In the upcoming period, with the improvement in liquidity and capital adequacy ratios of the banking sector, the fall in interest rates and adjustments in required reserves are expected to further support credit growth. In addition, non-performing loans and Stage 2 loans are monitored closely for any impact they might have on banks’ loan supply in the short term. Employment and income developments will determine the persistence of recent rate cut-driven rebound in loan demand. The pace, scope and sustainability of normalization in credit conditions will be important for the outlook for economic activity.
17. Inflation expectations remain favorable. Developments in inflation expectations, domestic demand conditions and producer prices have contributed to a mild trend in core inflation indicators. The improvement in macroeconomic indicators, inflation in particular, supports the fall in country risk premium and helps contain cost pressures. The course of inflation is considered to be broadly in line with the year-end inflation projection. Accordingly, considering all factors affecting the inflation outlook, the Committee decided to make a more measured cut in the policy rate. At this point, the current monetary policy stance remains consistent with the projected disinflation path.
18. The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is a key factor for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process on track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, monetary stance will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives. In order to support the effectiveness of monetary policy and minimize a likely inflation-growth trade-off, it will be crucial that macro-financial policies are determined with a focus on reducing financial volatility and risk premium, and that the predictability of fiscal policy continues to be reinforced.
19. The fiscal policy outlook that the monetary policy is based on incorporates a policy stance that focuses on price stability and macroeconomic rebalancing and that is coordinated with the monetary policy. Accordingly, the monetary policy stance assumes that administered price and tax adjustments are formulated in a way that will help reduce the backward- indexation behavior.

In view of the likely impacts of the recent surge in consumer loans on growth composition, inflation and external balance, as well as the increase in loan growth triggered by TL loans that were extended to facilitate early repayment or early restructuring of FX cash loans,the CBRT has decided to introduce some changes in the reserve requirement regulation.
Accordingly, banks will be able to benefit from reserve requirement incentives under the following conditions:

For banks with a real annual loan growth rate above 15%: If their adjusted real loan growth rate, which is calculated by deducting the entire real changes in loans with a longer-than-two-year maturity extended to selected sectors and housing loans with a five-year and longer maturity from the numerator of the growth rate formula, is below 15%,
	 
For banks with a real annual loan growth rate below 15%: If their adjusted real loan growth rate, which is calculated by deducting 75% of the real change in retail loans excluding housing loans with a five-year and longer maturity and the entire TL loans extended -starting from 9 March 2020 to facilitate early repayment or early restructuring of FX cash loans from the numerator of the growth rate formula, is above 5%.

Selected sectors have been determined according to the Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community (NACE) as follows:



Section
Definition


A
Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing


B
Mining and Quarrying


C

Manufacturing
(excluding 11.01-Distilling, rectifying and blending of spirits, 11.02-Manufacture of wine from grape, 11.03-Manufacture of cider and other fruit wines, 11.04-Manufacture of other non-distilled fermented beverages, 11.05-Manufacture of beer, 11.06-Manufacture of malt and 12-Manufacture of tobacco products)

It is considered that the new practice will help channel loan supply towards productive and production-oriented sectors that will support sustainable growth, rather than consumption, affect the current account balance positively and support financial stability. 
The revisions will take effect from the calculation period of 6 March 2020 with the maintenance period starting on 20 March 2020.

The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 10.75 percent to 9.75 percent.
As developments regarding the spread of the coronavirus have weakened global growth outlook, central banks in advanced and emerging economies have taken coordinated expansionary measures. The pandemic disease is closely monitored for its evolving global impact on capital flows, financial conditions, international trade and commodity prices.
In the period preceding the coronavirus outbreak, Turkey’s macroeconomic indicators improved significantly. A sustained fall in inflation and a sizable adjustment in the current account were achieved. The recovery of economic activity became stronger along with the improvement in financial conditions. In this period, foreign currency indebtedness of nonfinancial firms decreased; liquidity and capital buffers of the banking sector strengthened. The achievements of the rebalancing process have increased the resilience of the Turkish economy against unfavorable shocks. In order to contain negative effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the Turkish economy, it is of crucial importance to ensure the healthy functioning of financial markets, the credit channel and firms’ cash flows. Accordingly, with an aim to support financial stability, the central bank will implement a comprehensive set of measures.
Developments in inflation expectations, domestic demand conditions and producer prices have contributed to a mild trend in core inflation indicators. Despite the recent depreciation in the Turkish lira due to global developments, the sharp fall in international commodity prices, especially crude oil and metal prices, affects inflation outlook favorably. Furthermore, due to the weakening in global trade and measures such as travel restrictions, the disinflationary effect of aggregate demand conditions has increased to some extent. In this respect, it is considered that downside risks on the year-end inflation projection have increased. Accordingly, the Committee decided to make a 100 basis point cut in the policy rate.
The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is a key factor for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, monetary stance will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

Press Release on the Measures Taken against the Likely Economic and Financial Impacts of the Coronavirus
In order to contain possible adverse effects of the global uncertainty led by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on the Turkish economy, the CBRT has taken certain measures. These measures aim at (i)enhancing predictability by providing banks with flexibility in Turkish lira and foreign exchange liquidity management, (ii) offering targeted additional liquidity facilities to banks to secure uninterrupted credit flow to the corporate sector, (iii) boosting cash flow of exporting firms through arrangements on rediscount credits, which are as follows:
1. The CBRT will provide banks with as much liquidity as they need through intraday and overnight standing facilities.
2. As stated in the Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2020, in addition to one-week repo auctions, the CBRT’s main policy instrument, the Bank may inject liquidity to the market through repo auctions with maturities up to 91 days on the days needed. At a bank’s request, that bank’s entire winning bid or part of the bid may be concluded as a deposit transaction at the Interbank Money Market, instead of a repo transaction, carrying the same interest rate and maturity, as is the case with the current implementation for one-week repo auctions.
3. To support the Primary Dealership System, liquidity limits of Primary Dealers in the framework of Open Market Operations (OMOs) have been increased.
4. Conventional (multi-price) swap auctions with maturities of one, three and six months, which are currently available against US dollars, may also be held against euros and gold.
5. FX reserve requirement ratios will be reduced by 500 basis points in all liability types and all maturity brackets for banks that meet real credit growth conditions within the context of the reserve requirement practice. With this decision, it is expected that the banks, which meet real credit growth conditions, will be provided with FX and gold liquidity at the amount of approximately USD 5.1 billion. This revision will take effect from the calculation period of 6 March 2020 with the maintenance period starting on 20 March 2020.
6. Banks have been offered targeted additional liquidity facilities to secure uninterrupted credit flow to the corporate sector. The maximum amount of funds that an eligible bank may receive from this new liquidity facility will be linked to the amount of credit that this bank has already provided or will provide for the corporate sector. The total amount of the facilities to be offered is projected to be limited to 25% of the system’s total funding need. Accordingly:

Turkish lira liquidity will be provided via repo auctions with maturities up to 91 days with an interest rate 150 basis points lower than the one-week repo rate, i.e. the CBRT’s policy rate, and with quantity auction method. At a bank’s request, that bank’s entire winning bid or part of the bid may also be concluded as a deposit transaction at the Interbank Money Market under the same conditions.
Turkish lira currency swap auctions with a maturity of 1 year based on quantity auction method will be conducted. With these swap auctions, related banks will be provided with Turkish lira liquidity against US dollars, euros and gold with an interest rate 100 basis points lower than the one-week repo rate, i.e. policy rate.
The CBRT will provide banks with detailed information about limits regarding the above-mentioned facilities.

7. The CBRT has introduced the following measures regarding rediscount credits for export and foreign exchange earning services to mitigate the likely adverse impacts of recent global economic uncertainties and adversities in international trade on real sector firms:

The maturities for repayments of rediscount credits, which will be due from 18 March 2020 to 30 June 2020, can be extended by up to 90 days. Accordingly, firms can apply to intermediary banks and exchange their current bills for a bill with an up-to- 90-day-longer maturity, without making any repayment. This can postpone the repayment of rediscount credits corresponding up to USD 7.6 billion.
An additional 12 months export commitment fulfillment time has been offered for the rediscount credits whose export commitment has not been fulfilled yet and for the rediscount credits to be used from 18 March 2020 to 30 June 2020. Thus, the maximum duration for the export commitment fulfillment for these aforementioned credits has been extended to 36 months from 24 months.
To be effective from 20 March 2020, the maximum maturities for rediscount credits have been extended to 240 days from 120 days for short-term credit utilization, and to 720 days for longer-term credit utilization.

24 March 2020
Press Release on Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 17 March 2020
Inflation Developments
1.    In February, consumer prices rose by 0.35% and annual inflation increased by 0.22 points to 12.37%. The rise in annual inflation of both unprocessed and processed food groups constituted the main factor that drove up consumer inflation. The fall in international oil prices triggered a decrease in fuel prices, leading to a decline in annual energy inflation. Services inflation slightly increased in February while core goods inflation remained mild. Against this background, annual inflation in B and C indicators rose moderately but they maintained a relatively flat trend.
2.    Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 1.54 points to 10.58% in February. Led by fresh fruits-vegetables and red meat, unprocessed food prices surged on a seasonal basis. Although annual inflation in this group was driven up by this surge, it remained at historically low levels. The recent strong uptrend in processed food prices somewhat weakened in February, and annual processed food inflation increased to a limited extent. Bread and cereals continued to be the main driver of this increase, followed by fats and oils as well as meat products.
3.    Energy prices dropped by 0.63% in February, and annual energy inflation decreased by 1.60 points to 15.54%. This was mainly driven by fuel prices that dropped due to the fall in international oil prices notwithstanding the depreciation in the exchange rate. Leading indicators for March signal that energy prices will decline on a monthly basis, and annual energy inflation will significantly decrease due to base effects as well.
4.    In February, annual core goods inflation fell by 0.30 points to 7.05%. In this period, annual inflation remained flat in clothing and footwear group while it slightly decreased in durable goods and other core goods. Durable goods prices declined in February, with continued impact of the VAT reduction in furniture. On the other hand, gold prices rose due to exchange rate effects and international developments, keeping annual inflation in this group elevated.
5.    Prices of services rose by 0.84% in February and annual services inflation increased by 0.29 points to 12.49%. In this period, annual inflation was up in transport, rents and other services and flat in restaurants-hotels and communication. Among other services, the increases in maintenance-repair, healthcare services and package tours stand out, all of which are highly sensitive to exchange rate changes, while prices for recreation and culture services also saw a notable increase. Services inflation will likely be determined by real unit labor costs and backward indexation in the upcoming period, whereas, the measures taken to offset the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak and weakened demand conditions will put some restraint on services inflation through related sectors.
6.    Inflation expectations remained moderate in March, and the distribution of expectations pointed at a strengthened consensus among survey participants.
Factors Affecting Inflation 
7.    GDP data for the fourth quarter of 2019 suggested that economic activity strengthened on the back of domestic demand thanks to improving financial conditions and accelerating loans. In this period, private consumption spending remained on the rise while public spending continued to be supportive through the consumption channel. Investments remained weak, some recovery notwithstanding. Meanwhile, despite continued increase in exports, net exports made a negative contribution to annual and quarterly growth due to rising imports.
8.    Current data suggest that economic activity remains robust for the January-February period, and its sectoral diffusion continues to improve. The acceleration in loans buoyed up domestic demand, while investments and employment showed signs of recovery but nevertheless remained weak.
9.    Favorable effects of improved competitiveness and the partial recovery in global growth helped exports remain on the rise through January and February. On the other hand, import demand continued to surge due to the outlook in loans and domestic demand.
10.    As of March, the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic has begun to weigh on economic activity through foreign trade, tourism and domestic demand channels. Contracted global trade volume and restricted travel rights confine exports and transportation activities. Moreover, possible effects of aggravated uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets on the domestic demand are monitored closely. Despite the deceleration in exports and tourism revenues, the sizeable decline in energy prices in the upcoming period is likely to cause the current account balance to follow a mild course.
11.    In the December period, the fall in unemployment rates continued with the decline in the participation rate. The partial recovery in construction employment continued compared to the previous period, whereas industrial employment receded, and services employment remained flat. While leading indicators show that unemployment rates will decline further in the first quarter, outlook in the labor market amid the limiting effects of the pandemic on economic activity is closely monitored.
Monetary Policy and Risks
12.    The fast spread of the pandemic on a global scale aggravates uncertainties and deteriorates global growth prospects. Global monetary policies grew more supportive of economic activity within the scope of emergency measures to minimize the financial and economic impacts of the pandemic. While central banks in advanced and emerging economies have taken coordinated expansionary measures, comprehensive sets of fiscal policy measures have been introduced in many countries to support households and firms. Meanwhile, persisting financial volatilities and measures to slowdown the spread of the disease weigh on aggregate demand conditions on a global scale. Impacts of these factors on domestic growth, especially through exports, tourism and related sectors are monitored closely. Monetary policy instruments could be readjusted depending on the size and persistence of the effects of measures, such as travel restrictions and uncertainties, on economic activity and labor market through the domestic demand channel.
13.    Along with the downturn in global economic activity that limits the demand for commodities, increased volatility in financial markets led to plummeting prices in commodities, with crude oil and metals in the lead. Moreover, supply-side effects driven by disagreements among oil exporters regarding the amount of oil production keep crude oil prices subsided. Against this background, and also with the weakening global growth outlook, global inflation rates are expected to be lower in 2020.
14.    Meanwhile, heightened uncertainties regarding the recent coronavirus outbreak and the liquidity crunch caused a sharp downturn in global equity and bond yields as well as a decline in risk appetite and the demand for emerging market financial assets. The evolving global impact of the pandemic disease on capital flows, financial conditions, international trade and commodity prices as well as policy actions taken towards limiting this impact are closely monitored.
15.    In the period preceding the coronavirus outbreak, Turkey’s macroeconomic indicators improved significantly. A sustained fall in inflation and a sizable adjustment in the current account were achieved. The recovery of economic activity became stronger along with the improvement in financial conditions. In this period, foreign currency indebtedness of nonfinancial firms decreased; liquidity and capital buffers of the banking sector strengthened. The achievements of the rebalancing process have increased the resilience of the Turkish economy against unfavorable shocks. Nevertheless, the increase in financial volatility and expected slowdown in aggregate demand are closely monitored for their impact on firms’ cash flows and balance sheets. Accordingly, necessary measures will continue to be taken in coordination with other policies.
16.    In order to contain negative effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the Turkish economy, it is of crucial importance to ensure the healthy functioning of financial markets, the credit channel and firms’ cash flows. Accordingly, with an aim to support financial stability, the Central Bank implemented a comprehensive set of measures. With the objective of containing possible adverse effects of the global uncertainty led by the coronavirus pandemic on the Turkish economy, the CBRT has announced a series of measures aiming at (i) enhancing predictability by providing banks with flexibility in Turkish lira and foreign exchange liquidity management, (ii) offering targeted additional liquidity facilities to banks to secure uninterrupted credit flow to the corporate sector, (iii) boosting cash flow of exporting firms through arrangements on rediscount credits.
17.    Additionally, considering that downside risks to the year-end inflation projection increased, the Committee decided to cut the policy rate by 100 basis points. Developments in inflation expectations, domestic demand conditions and producer prices have contributed to a mild trend in core inflation indicators. Despite the recent depreciation in the Turkish lira due to global developments, the sharp fall in international commodity prices, especially crude oil and metal prices, affects inflation outlook favorably. Furthermore, due to the weakening in global trade and measures such as travel restrictions, the disinflationary effect of aggregate demand conditions has increased to some extent. The policy rate cut, along with other measures taken, is expected to contribute to ensuring healthy functioning of financial markets and supporting the cash flow of the corporate sector. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives.
18.    The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is a key factor for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, monetary stance will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process.
19.    The Committee assessed that it is essential to sustain the coordination between monetary and fiscal policies to minimize the pandemic disease-related economic risks. The multifaceted effects of the pandemic on the economy call for coordinated policy actions aiming particularly at smoothing cash flows and stabilizing employment in order to minimize the impact on firms and households. Therefore, it is considered to be of critical importance that macro-scale monetary and fiscal policies are complemented with policy measures that target the most-affected economic units also by considering sectoral interactions. Meanwhile, ensuring that policy measures are designed in a targeted and temporary fashion would support policy effectiveness.
20.    It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance."

Press Release on Additional Measures Taken against the Economic and Financial Impacts of the Coronavirus
The measures taken to contain adverse effects of the global uncertainty led by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on the Turkish economy were announced on 17 March 2020. For the same purpose, the CBRT introduces the following additional measures to (i) strengthen the monetary transmission mechanism by boosting the liquidity of the Government Domestic Debt Securities (GDDS) market, (ii) enhance banks’ flexibility in Turkish lira and foreign exchange liquidity management, and (iii) secure uninterrupted credit flow to the corporate sector, and broadly support the goods and services exporting firms, which are affected by the pandemic, with an SME-focused approach: 

Outright purchase operations under the Open Market Operations (OMO) portfolio, which are conducted within the limits identified at the Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2020 text, can be carried out in a front-loaded manner and these limits may be revised depending on the market conditions. These operations are intended to enhance the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism via increasing the market depth, enabling sound asset pricing and providing banks with flexibility in liquidity management. 
For a temporary period, the Primary Dealer banks, will be able to sell the GDDS that they have bought from the Unemployment Insurance Fund to the CBRT under the terms and limits set by the CBRT, or will be able to increase at certain ratios the liquidity facility offered under OMO in the scope of the Primary Dealership system. This aims at supporting financial stability by containing the likely impacts of the liquidity need of the Unemployment Insurance Fund on market functioning. These GDDS purchases will be out of the scope of the limits set for the OMO portfolio. The related parties will be provided with detailed information and criteria for these operations.
Under the Turkish lira and foreign exchange operations conducted at the CBRT, asset-backed securities and mortgage-backed securities have been included in the collateral pool. Accepting these securities as collateral will contribute to increasing the liquidity of similar securities issuances and to deepening the capital markets, and also enhance banks’ flexibility in Turkish lira and foreign exchange market liquidity management. Banks will be further informed about the criteria for securities to be accepted as collateral and the limits for this facility.
The limits for the targeted additional liquidity facilities offered to secure uninterrupted credit flow to the corporate sector will be increased. In addition to the targeted liquidity facilities of repo auctions with maturities up to 91 days and Turkish lira currency swaps with a maturity of one year, the CBRT will also hold Turkish lira currency swap auctions with a maturity of six months. Through these swap auctions with six-month maturity, related banks will be provided with Turkish lira liquidity against US dollars, euros or gold, at an interest rate 125 basis points lower than the one-week repo rate, i.e. the CBRT’s policy rate.  
To facilitate goods and services exporting firms’ access to finance and support sustainability of employment, Turkish lira-denominated rediscount credits for export and foreign exchange earning services will be extended. Turkish lira-denominated rediscount credits will be extended based on the following principles: 

A total limit of TRY 60 billion has been defined for the credits. 
Of this limit, TRY 20 billion has been allocated for credit utilization via Türk Eximbank, TRY 30 billion for credit utilization via public banks, and TRY 10 billion for credit utilization via other banks. 
Minimum 70% of the credits to be extended via banks other than Eximbank will be allocated to SMEs. 
On a firm basis, the maximum amounts of credits have been set at TRY 25 million for SMEs and TRY 50 million for other firms.
Firms that can obtain FX rediscount credits, overseas contracting companies, and firms participating in international fairs will be able to benefit from this credit facility. 
The interest rate for these credits will be 150 basis points lower than the one-week repo rate, i.e. the CBRT’s policy rate. 
The maximum commission rate of intermediary banks will be 150 basis points. 
The credits will have a maximum maturity of 360 days, and will be extended on condition that the export or foreign exchange earning services commitment as well as the employment level as of 1 March 2020 are maintained throughout the credit period.

17 April 2020
Press Release on Additional Measures Taken against the Economic and Financial Impacts of the Coronavirus
In its press release dated 31 March 2020 on additional measures taken against the economic and financial impacts of the coronavirus outbreak, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) announced that the outright purchase operations under the Open Market Operations (OMO) portfolio, which are conducted within the limits identified in the Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2020 text, could be carried out in a front-loaded manner and that these limits might be revised depending on market conditions. Moreover, the Bank also noted that purchases, made as part of the facility offered temporarily to Primary Dealer banks to sell the Government Domestic Debt Securities (GDDS) they had bought from the Unemployment Insurance Fund to the CBRT under the terms and limits set by the CBRT, would be considered outside the limits set for the OMO portfolio. Accordingly, to maintain market depth, strengthen the monetary policy transmission mechanism and support the Primary Dealership system, the CBRT has taken the following additional measures:

The maximum limit for the ratio of the OMO portfolio nominal size to the CBRT analytical balance sheet total assets, set at 5% for 2020 in the Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2020 text, has been revised to 10%.
To further support the Primary Dealership system considering its contributions to the deepening of financial markets and to the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, the facility offered to Primary Dealer (PD) banks to sell GDDS to the CBRT has been revised. Accordingly the CBRT has decided that;

The limits offered to PD banks for outright sales of GDDS to the CBRT will be applied independent of the repo transaction limits and that PD banks will be offered a GDDS selling limit that is equal to the repo transaction limits,
The related purchases will also be carried out within the total maximum limit of 10% set for the OMO portfolio,
The GDDS to be purchased and the amount of purchases will be determined by the CBRT, and 
Purchases will be conducted via the quantity auction method.

The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 9.75 percent to 8.75 percent.
As developments regarding the spread of the coronavirus substantially weaken global growth outlook, central banks in advanced and emerging economies continue to take expansionary measures. The pandemic disease is closely monitored for its evolving global impact on capital flows, financial conditions, international trade and commodity prices.
Having displayed a strong upward trend in January and February, thanks to the improvement in financial conditions, economic activity has started to weaken in mid-March due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on external trade, tourism and domestic demand. In order to contain negative effects of the pandemic on the Turkish economy, it is of crucial importance to ensure the healthy functioning of financial markets, the credit channel and firms’ cash flows. In this respect, recent monetary and fiscal measures will contribute to financial stability and post-pandemic recovery by supporting the potential output of the economy. Current account balance, which recently recorded significant improvement, is expected to follow a moderate course throughout the year due to the restraining effects of commodity prices and imports.
Developments in inflation expectations, domestic demand conditions and producer prices have contributed to a mild trend in core inflation indicators. Despite the recent depreciation in the Turkish lira due to global developments, continued sharp decline in international commodity prices, especially crude oil and metal prices, affects inflation outlook favorably. While the rise in unit costs resulting from declining production and sales is closely monitored, the disinflationary effects of aggregate demand conditions are estimated to have increased. In this respect, it is considered that risks on the year-end inflation projection are on the downside. Accordingly, the Committee decided to make a 100 basis point cut in the policy rate.
The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is a key factor for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance.

30 April 2020
Press Release on Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 22 April 2020
Inflation Developments
1. In March, consumer prices increased by 0.57% while annual inflation dropped by 0.51 points to 11.86%. Food and energy groups constituted the main drivers of the fall in consumer inflation. Despite the depreciation in the Turkish lira, fuel prices decreased on the back of the fall in international oil prices, and annual energy inflation declined significantly. Meanwhile, the deceleration in food inflation was driven by fresh fruit-vegetable prices. Inflation slightly decreased in services whereas it rose in core goods group due to exchange rate developments. Against this background, annual inflation in B and C indicators rose moderately but they maintained a relatively flat trend.
2. Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages declined by 0.53 points to 10.05% in March. Annual unprocessed food inflation was driven down by fresh fruit-vegetable prices but it rose when this item is excluded. This rise was led by meat prices, followed by increases in prices of pulses. On the other hand, annual inflation in the processed food group increased slightly. While inflation in the bread and cereals group remained elevated, other groups driving processed food inflation up were fats and oils as well as non-alcoholic beverages due to the tax increase in this group.
3. Energy prices fell by 3.12% in March, and annual energy inflation dropped by 5.73 points to 9.81%. This fall was mainly led by fuel prices that decreased in tandem with international oil prices. Leading indicators suggest that the marked decline in annual energy inflation will continue in April.
4. In March, annual core goods inflation rose by 1.13 points to 8.18%. While this rise was observed across all subcategories, it was more pronounced in durable goods inflation. The rise in durable goods prices was predominantly driven by the increases in automobile and furniture prices caused by the depreciation in the Turkish lira, while the seasonal price increase in the clothing and footwear group was somewhat stronger compared to the previous year.
5. Services prices were up by 0.52% in March, and annual services inflation decreased by 0.07 points to 12.42%. In this period, annual inflation slightly rose in transport and restaurants-hotels groups and remained flat in rents and communication, whereas it decelerated in other services group. Among other services, monthly inflation in package tour, maintenance-repair, and recreation and culture services recorded a weak course due to the measures taken against the coronavirus pandemic. Health services prices in this group remained on the rise due to exchange rate developments as well. The pandemic also had an impact on the restaurants-hotels group as inflation in this group was contained by the decrease in accommodation services prices despite the rise in prices of food and beverage services driven by cost hikes.
6. The improvement in year-end inflation expectations continued in April. However, the inflation forecast uncertainty moderately increased due to uncertainties regarding the course of the pandemic. Accordingly, in 12-month-ahead inflation expectations, probabilities assigned to extreme values in either direction slightly increased.
Factors Affecting Inflation
7. Having displayed a strong upward trend in January and February, thanks to the improvement in financial conditions, economic activity has started to weaken in mid-March due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on external trade, tourism and domestic demand. Survey indicators and high-frequency data point that this weakening trend has become pronounced in April, spreading across all sectors. The weakening in services, particularly in tourism-related sectors, has been more accentuated. In the manufacturing industry, orders and capacity utilization rates of main exporting sectors dropped to substantially low levels due to the sharp decline in external demand. Meanwhile, food, paper products, computer and electronic goods, and basic pharmaceutical industries, which periodically record comparatively strong demand, diverge positively in relative terms.
8. Export and tourism revenues are on the decline due to the deterioration in the global growth outlook and travel restrictions. While tourism and related transportation activities have come to a halt, export opportunities are significantly shrinking in motor vehicles, wearing apparel, textile, leather, machinery-equipment, and electrical equipment sectors for which the European region is the main market. On the other hand, import demand is decreasing at a rapid pace in line with the deceleration in economic activity while low levels of commodity prices are restraining the import bill. Against this background, current account balance, which recently recorded significant improvement, is expected to follow a moderate course throughout the year due to the restraining effects of commodity prices and imports.
9. The Committee assesses that the unfavorable effects of the pandemic are temporary and the economy’s recovery, which is expected to be sooner and stronger for domestic demand, will start as of the second half of the year. The pace of the recovery in economic activity will depend on the course of the normalization process in Turkey as well as in the global economy, particularly in our foreign trade partners. Accordingly, to contain negative effects of the pandemic on the Turkish economy, it is of crucial importance to ensure the healthy functioning of financial markets, the credit channel and firms’ cash flows. In this respect, recent monetary and fiscal measures will contribute to financial stability and post-pandemic recovery by supporting the potential output of the economy.
10. In the January period, the fall in unemployment rates continued while non-farm employment slightly declined led by the industrial sector. Leading indicators suggest that the slowdown in economic activity started to have its impact on the labor market as of mid-March. The Committee assessed that subsidies provided through the unemployment insurance fund and current transfers, short-time work allowance in particular, have played a critical role in limiting the income loss of households and maintaining employment.
Monetary Policy and Risks
11. The coronavirus-led global economic downturn is deepening. Measures to contain the contagion first affected supply chains and production, but demand has also weakened significantly amid heightened uncertainty, tight financial conditions, reduced household income and worsening cash flows of businesses as the outbreak evolved into a global pandemic. Substantial economic measures are introduced to avoid any permanent damage to employment, supply chains and output capacity. Central banks in advanced and emerging economies continue adopting expansionary policies, and rate cuts, asset purchases, liquidity measures and credit support programs are among the foremost monetary responses to the pandemic. On the fiscal front, spending, tax and credit-related measures have been in place to support the hardest hit sectors and lay out the foundation for a post-pandemic recovery. The effectiveness of these policies for financial markets, growth and employment will depend on how fast the pandemic is contained in each country and how much policy room they have.
12. There remain uncertainties regarding the global and domestic pace of the virus’ spread and the normalization process. In this regard, it is still unclear how long the measures taken to prevent the spread of the virus such as travel restrictions, lockdowns and social isolation will last, timing of these measures and how much they will affect consumer behavior and buying habits. A prolonged normalization phase could translate into a much weaker global and domestic growth outlook, calling for additional response measures.
13. Crude oil demand has decreased significantly as economic activity is grinding to a halt across many industries around the globe. While global crude oil inventories are at record-high levels, oil output reductions may still fall short of the decline in demand. Thus, there remain demand-led downside risks to crude oil prices. Amid plunging global demand as well as falling commodity prices, global inflation rates are expected to be moderate throughout 2020.
14. The weakening global risk appetite caused significant rise in financial market volatility. Stock and bond markets in advanced and emerging economies have recently seen major volatility. As substantial capital outflows were observed in emerging economies, Turkey’s country risk premium increased, Turkish lira depreciated, and exchange rate volatility rose in line with the overall trend. Once uncertainty about the pandemic declines, the negative impact of global developments on country risk premium and exchange rate volatility will likely fade, also with the help of monetary and fiscal policy measures. As uncertainty still reigns, the pandemic disease is closely monitored for its evolving global impact on capital flows, financial conditions, international trade and commodity prices. Thus, the CBRT will continue to monitor the effects of the pandemic on the Turkish economy and use the tools at its disposal in pursuit of its price stability and financial stability objectives.
15. Before the outbreak, financial conditions have improved considerably thanks to falling inflation and rate cuts, and loan growth has accelerated since the third quarter of 2019. Having lost momentum due to macroprudential measures in the first months of 2020, consumer loan growth has slowed further since mid-March when the first coronavirus case was reported. On the other hand, commercial loans remained on the rise in the first quarter. Monetary, financial and fiscal measures introduced to address the pandemic as well as the expansion of loan supply, mostly by state-owned banks, seem to have mitigated downside risks to loan growth and contributed to the uninterrupted flow of credit to the real sector. In this regard, the Bank will continue to monitor the credit market closely and implement necessary measures to ensure that the credit channel functions smoothly.
16. Developments in inflation expectations, domestic demand conditions and producer prices have contributed to a mild trend in core inflation indicators. Despite the recent depreciation in the Turkish lira due to global developments, continued sharp decline in international commodity prices, especially crude oil and metal prices, affects the inflation outlook favorably. While the rise in unit costs resulting from declining production and sales is closely monitored, the disinflationary effects of aggregate demand conditions are estimated to have increased. In this respect, it is considered that risks to the year-end inflation projection presented in the January Inflation Report are on the downside. Accordingly, the Committee decided to make a 100 basis point cut in the policy rate.
17. The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is a key factor for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, monetary stance will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives.
18. The Committee assessed that it is essential to sustain the coordination between monetary and fiscal policies to minimize the pandemic-related economic risks. The multifaceted effects of the pandemic on the economy call for coordinated policy actions aiming particularly at smoothing cash flows and stabilizing employment in order to minimize the impact on firms and households. Therefore, it is considered to be of critical importance that macro-scale monetary and fiscal policies be complemented with policy measures that target the most-affected economic units also by considering sectoral interactions. Meanwhile, ensuring that policy measures are designed in a targeted and temporary fashion would support policy effectiveness.
19. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance."

Participating Committee Members
Murat Uysal (Governor), Murat Çetinkaya, Ömer Duman, Uğur Namık Küçük, Oğuzhan Özbaş, Emrah Şener, Abdullah Yavaş.
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 8.75 percent to 8.25 percent.
As developments regarding the spread of the coronavirus substantially weaken global growth outlook, central banks in advanced and emerging economies continue to take expansionary measures. While uncertainties on global economic recovery remain high, normalization steps taken by several countries are being watched. The pandemic disease is closely monitored for its evolving global impact on capital flows, financial conditions, international trade and commodity prices.
Having displayed a strong upward trend in January and February, thanks to the improvement in financial conditions, economic activity has started to weaken in mid-March due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on external trade, tourism and domestic demand. While the weakening in economic activity became more pronounced in April, high-frequency indicators for the first half of May display signs of bottoming-out following the steps taken towards partial normalization. In order to contain negative effects of the pandemic on the Turkish economy, it is of crucial importance to ensure the healthy functioning of financial markets, the credit channel and firms’ cash flows. In this respect, recent monetary and fiscal measures will contribute to financial stability and post-pandemic recovery by supporting the potential output of the economy. Despite the fall in exports and tourism revenues due to the pandemic, current account balance is expected to follow a moderate course throughout the year due to the restraining effects of commodity prices and imports.
Developments in inflation expectations and domestic demand conditions have contributed to a mild trend in core inflation indicators. Despite the recent depreciation in the Turkish lira due to global developments, international commodity prices, especially crude oil and metal prices, affect inflation outlook favorably. While the rise in unit costs resulting from declining production and sales is closely monitored, the disinflationary effects of aggregate demand conditions are estimated to have increased. Although consumer inflation might follow a slightly higher course in the short-term due to seasonal and pandemic-related effects on food prices, demand-driven disinflationary effects will be more prevalent in the second half of the year. Accordingly, considering all factors affecting the inflation outlook, the Committee decided to make a measured cut in the policy rate. Under the current monetary policy stance, inflation outlook is considered to be in line with the year-end inflation projection.
The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is a key factor for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, monetary stance will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives.

01 June 2020
Press Release on Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 21 May 2020
Inflation Developments
1.    In April, consumer prices increased by 0.85% while annual inflation dropped by 0.92 points to 10.94%. The energy group was the main driver of the fall in consumer inflation, whereas the food group hindered a more positive outlook. Energy prices fell further on the back of international oil prices, but food prices increased above seasonal trends. The fall in services inflation spread across subcategories, and annual core goods inflation lost momentum despite the exchange rate developments. Against this background, annual inflation and the trends of B and C indicators posted a decline.
2.    Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 1.23 points to 11.28% in April. Price increases spread across the unprocessed food group, while red meat as well as pulses with high dependency on foreign trade stood out. The uptrend in processed food prices continued in April. Inflation in the bread and cereals group remained elevated, while fats-oils and non-alcoholic beverages also drove processed food inflation upwards. Prospects for food inflation were shaped by a set of factors such as pandemic-related impacts, the current demand increase as well as tax adjustments and exchange rate developments. Leading indicators suggest that the rise in annual food inflation will continue in May due to unprocessed food prices.
3.    Energy prices fell by 4.99% in April, and annual energy inflation declined by 6.51 points to 3.30%. The depreciation in the Turkish lira notwithstanding, falling international oil prices remained as the determining factor. Leading indicators suggest a slight rise in annual energy inflation in May. Meanwhile, due to the raised minimum lump sum special consumption tax, it is projected that cigarette prices will edge up in May, yet annual inflation in this group will decline further due to the base effect.
4.    In April, annual core goods inflation dropped by 0.30 points to 7.88%. In this period, annual inflation remained relatively flat in durable goods, and decreased in other subcategories. In the durable goods group, the automobile and furniture items stood out with an upsurge in prices following the depreciation in the Turkish lira, while the seasonal price increase in the clothing and footwear group proved quite limited compared to previous years.
5.    Services prices inched up by 0.22% in April, and annual services inflation decreased by 0.66 points to 11.76%. In this period, consequences of the pandemic became quite apparent on services prices. Annual inflation receded in all subcategories, and the most pronounced decline was seen in the restaurants-hotels and transport services groups, the operations of which were interrupted. In April, communication services recorded falling prices, while increases in rents slowed further. Meanwhile, prices in maintenance-repair services posted a high-rated increase due to exchange rate developments.
6.    Inflation expectations improved further in May with a decline across all horizons.
Factors Affecting Inflation
7.    Having displayed a strong upward trend in January and February, thanks to the improvement in financial conditions, economic activity has started to weaken in mid-March due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on external trade, tourism and domestic demand. The industrial production index posted a month-on-month decline by 7.1% in March in seasonally and calendar-adjusted terms, but remained flat on a quarterly basis. An analysis of sectoral breakdown reveals substantial decreases in production of export-oriented sectors such as manufacture of textiles, wearing apparel, computer-electronic and optical products, motor vehicles and other transport equipment, while the manufacture of food, tobacco, paper, chemical, pharmaceutical, other non-metallic mineral products and basic metal in relative terms diverged positively. Despite the significant weakening in March, due to the robust course in the January-February period, annual growth in national income is expected to realize at a relatively favorable level in the first quarter.
8.    The weakening in economic activity became more pronounced in April and spread across all sectors. Activity came to a near standstill in tourism and related sectors while retail trade saw a deepening slowdown, except for food and market purchases. On the manufacturing industry front, new orders and capacity utilization rates fell to record lows across main exporting sectors due to slumping external demand. High-frequency indicators for the first half of May display signs of bottoming-out following the steps taken towards partial normalization. In this context, there have been slight increases in exports, imports and capacity utilization rates. 
9.    Export and tourism revenues declined due to the deterioration in the global growth outlook and travel restrictions. Export opportunities shrunk significantly in motor vehicles, wearing apparel, textile, leather, machinery-equipment, and electrical equipment sectors for which the European region is the main market. On the other hand, import demand is decreasing at a rapid pace in line with the deceleration in economic activity while low levels of commodity prices are restraining the import bill. As a result, despite the fall in exports and tourism revenues due to the pandemic, current account balance is expected to follow a moderate course throughout the year due to the restraining effects of commodity prices and imports.
10.    The Committee assesses that the unfavorable effects of the pandemic are temporary and the economy’s recovery, which is expected to be sooner and stronger for domestic demand, will start as of the second half of the year. The pace of the recovery in economic activity will depend on the course of the normalization process in Turkey as well as in the global economy, particularly in our foreign trade partners. Accordingly, in order to contain negative effects of the pandemic on the Turkish economy, it is of crucial importance to ensure the healthy functioning of financial markets, the credit channel and firms’ cash flows. In this respect, recent monetary and fiscal measures will contribute to financial stability and post-pandemic recovery by supporting the potential output of the economy.
11.    Unemployment remained flat in February, while non-farm employment decreased across all sectors. Job losses were mostly accounted for by unregistered workers, while the falling labor force participation rate prevented the unemployment rate from rising. Leading indicators suggest that the spillover from the economic slowdown into the labor market was more pronounced in April. The Committee assessed that subsidies provided through the unemployment insurance fund and current transfers, short-time work allowance in particular, have played a critical role in limiting the income loss of households and maintaining employment.
Monetary Policy and Risks
12.    Developments regarding the spread of the coronavirus substantially weaken global growth outlook. Measures to contain the pandemic not only have affected supply chains and production on the supply side, but also have weakened demand significantly amid heightened uncertainty, tight financial conditions, reduced household income and worsening cash flows of businesses. Growth data available for the first quarter of 2020 confirm a sharp contraction for most economies while April’s PMI data and electricity consumption point to an even deeper contraction for the second quarter. As of March, the pandemic has a more limited impact on employment across advanced economies, except for the US, but dismal job prospects suggest that economic slowdown may amplify unemployment in those economies over the upcoming period. Accordingly, global growth forecasts were revised further down and the outlook for external demand, particularly from European economies, deteriorated from the previous month. The effects of these developments on domestic growth, particularly on exports, tourism and related sectors, are being closely monitored. 
13.    Central banks in advanced and emerging economies continue to take expansionary measures. There have been further rate cuts, albeit more moderate ones, and balance sheet sizes of major central banks remain on the rise. Emerging economies have also taken expansionary monetary policy measures such as bond purchases. The effectiveness of these policies for financial markets, growth and employment will depend on the course of the pandemic in each country and how much policy room each country has.
14.    While uncertainties on global economic recovery remain high, normalization steps taken by several countries are being watched. While the impact of normalization steps on economic activity is monitored in those countries, where the outbreak is starting to be brought relatively under control, uncertainties remain regarding the possible effects of the outbreak and health measures on consumption habits and general spending behavior. A prolonged normalization phase could translate into a much weaker global and domestic growth outlook, calling for additional response measures.
15.    Crude oil demand has decreased significantly with economic activity ground to a halt across many industries around the globe. Global crude oil inventories are at record-high levels. Although oil prices were slightly up after the steps taken by major oil producing countries to sustain output cuts, there remain downside risks to oil prices, particularly due to the uncertainty about the global economic activity. Amid plunging global demand as well as falling commodity prices, global inflation rates are expected to be moderate throughout 2020.
16.    The weakening global risk appetite caused a significant rise in financial market volatility. Global risk appetite and financial market volatility have recently shown signs of improvement. However, stock and bond markets in advanced and emerging economies continue to fluctuate. Emerging markets continue to see massive capital outflows. With somewhat reduced pandemic uncertainty and partially loosened restrictions, and thanks to recent monetary and financial measures, adverse effects of global developments on Turkey’s risk premium and exchange rate volatility partially eased. As uncertainty still reigns, the pandemic disease is closely monitored for its evolving global impact on capital flows, financial conditions, international trade and commodity prices. Thus, the CBRT will continue to monitor the effects of the pandemic on the Turkish economy and use the tools at its disposal in pursuit of its price stability and financial stability objectives.
17.    Monetary, financial and fiscal measures introduced to address the pandemic, as well as the expansion of loan supply, mostly by state-owned banks, have mitigated downside risks to loan growth and contributed to the uninterrupted flow of credit to the real sector. After having lost momentum due to macroprudential measures in the first months of 2020, consumer loan growth continues, albeit at a slower pace since mid-March when the first coronavirus case was reported. On the other hand, strong momentum in commercial loans continues. Guaranteed-loans, led by state-owned banks in particular, propped up commercial and personal loan supply and helped bring interest rates further down, thus alleviating the negative effects of the pandemic on income and cash flows of economic units. In this regard, the Bank will continue to monitor the credit market closely and implement necessary measures to ensure that the credit channel functions smoothly.
18.    Developments in inflation expectations and domestic demand conditions have contributed to a mild trend in core inflation indicators. Despite the recent depreciation in the Turkish lira due to global developments, international commodity prices, especially crude oil and metal prices, affect inflation outlook favorably. While the rise in unit costs resulting from declining production and sales is closely monitored, the disinflationary effects of aggregate demand conditions are estimated to have increased. Although consumer inflation might follow a slightly higher course in the short term due to seasonal and pandemic-related effects on food prices, demand-driven disinflationary effects will be more prevalent in the second half of the year. Accordingly, considering all factors affecting the inflation outlook, the Committee decided to make a measured cut in the policy rate. Under the current monetary policy stance, inflation outlook is considered to be in line with the year-end inflation projection.
19.    The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is a key factor for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, monetary stance will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives.
20.    The Committee assessed that it is essential to sustain the coordination between monetary and fiscal policies to minimize the pandemic-related economic risks. The multifaceted effects of the pandemic on the economy call for coordinated policy actions aiming particularly at smoothing cash flows and stabilizing employment in order to minimize the impact on firms and households. Therefore, it is considered to be of critical importance that macro-scale monetary and fiscal policies be complemented with policy measures that target the most-affected economic units and consider sectoral interactions.

Press Release on Advance Loans against Investment Commitment
In the press release published on 31 March 2020, it was announced that Turkish lira rediscount credits for export and FX earning services up to TRY 60 billion would be extended to contain adverse effects of the global uncertainty caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on the Turkish economy. Until now, the credit need for working capital has been met effectively by the banking system. Therefore, it is decided to reallocate the TRY 20 billion of the limit of Turkish lira rediscount credit facility as advance loans against investment commitment for more effective utilization in order to support investments in selected sectors that are critical to our country. The remaining TRY 40 billion limit of Turkish lira rediscount credits will continue to be extented through Turk Eximbank with an allocation of TRY 20 billion, as well as through state-owned banks and other banks, with allocations of TRY 10 billion each.
In line with the price stability and financial stability objectives of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT), advance loans against investment commitment aim to (i) support highly efficient investments that will reduce imports and boost exports, (ii) lower external dependency as well as reducing the current account deficit problem and (iii) support sustainable growth.
Advance loans against investment commitment will be extended through development and investment banks to firms that hold Investment Incentive Certificates and that will make investment in selected sectors. At first, loans will be extended through the Development and Investment Bank of Turkey; and other development and investment banks may be involved in the facility later. Loans will be extended at a fixed rate with a maximum maturity of 10 years. The loan interest rate for banks will be 150 basis points lower than the CBRT policy rate, which is the one-week repo rate, as is the case in Turkish lira rediscount credits. The maximum amount of loans available to individual firms, excluding exceptional and featured investment projects, will be limited to TRY 400 million, which will enable a larger number of firms to benefit from this facility.

Press Release on the Usage of the Chinese Yuan Funding
The first usage of the Chinese Yuan (CNY) funding under the swap agreement signed between the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) and the People’s Bank of China in 2019 has been realized on 18 June 2020. In this way, Turkish companies in various sectors paid their import bills from China using CNY through relevant banks.
The utilization of swap agreement resources is important in terms of facilitating the use of local currencies in international trade payments and the easy access of Turkish firms to international liquidity. It is also considered to be an important step that will further strengthen the financial cooperation between Turkey and China.
Furthermore, commercial banks will be able to expand their product range corresponding to international trade and finance activities with a strategy based on the swap agreement.
The CBRT will continue to support swap agreements and utilization of these resources as well as the use of local currencies in international trade payments.

Press Release on Reserve Requirements
A revision is made to the reserve requirement regulation that links the reserve requirement ratios and remuneration rates to loan growth rates.
The CBRT continues to use reserve requirements flexibly and effectively as a macroprudential tool to support short-term interest rates – its main monetary policy tool.
Circumstances of the coronavirus pandemic had adverse impacts on cash flows, increasing the loan demand of both individuals and firms. Measures put into effect ensured the efficient functioning of the credit mechanism and the increased loan demand was met to a considerable extent. This trend is expected to continue for a while in the normalization process as well.
To provide banks with flexibility in meeting the loan demand specific to this period, the CBRT has decided to temporarily (until the year end) suspend the enforcement of the rule of having adjusted real loan growth rate below 15% for the banks with a real annual loan growth rate above 15% in order to be able to benefit from reserve requirement incentives.
The revision will be effective from the calculation date of 12 June 2020 with the maintenance period starting on 26 June 2020 to the calculation date of 25 December 2020.

Press Release on Interest Rates
Participating Committee Members
Murat Uysal (Governor), Murat Çetinkaya, Ömer Duman, Uğur Namık Küçük, Oğuzhan Özbaş, Emrah Şener, Abdullah Yavaş.
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 8.25 percent.
As developments regarding the spread of the coronavirus substantially weakened global growth in the second quarter, normalization steps taken by several countries have contributed to a partial recovery. While uncertainties on global economic recovery remain high, central banks in advanced and emerging economies continue to take expansionary measures. The pandemic disease is closely monitored for its evolving global impact on capital flows, financial conditions, international trade and commodity prices.  
While the weakening in economic activity became more pronounced in April, economic recovery has started as of May following gradual steps towards normalization. In order to contain negative effects of the pandemic on the Turkish economy, it is of crucial importance to ensure the healthy functioning of financial markets, the credit channel and firms’ cash flows. In this respect, recent monetary and fiscal measures contribute to financial stability and economic recovery by supporting the potential output of the economy. Recently, exports and tourism revenues declined due to the pandemic. However, the recovery in exports of goods with the ongoing normalization and low levels of commodity prices will support the current account balance in the upcoming periods. 
Despite the restraining effects of aggregate demand conditions, pandemic-related rise in unit costs have led to some increase in the trends of core inflation indicators. International commodity prices have continued to restrain consumer inflation, while food inflation has risen due to seasonal and pandemic-related effects.  As the normalization process continues, supply-side factors, which have prevailed recently due to pandemic-related restrictions, will phase out and demand-driven disinflationary effects will become more prevalent in the second half of the year. Accordingly, considering all factors affecting the inflation outlook, the Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. 
The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is a key factor for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, monetary stance will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

02 July 2020
Press Release on Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 25 June 2020
Inflation Developments
1.    In May, consumer prices increased by 1.36% and annual inflation rose by 0.45 points to 11.39%. In this period, as underlined in the May MPC meeting summary, food inflation increased due to unprocessed food prices. Although energy inflation increased on the back of international oil prices, it continued to restrain consumer inflation. While the depreciation in the Turkish lira had reflections on the core goods, primarily the durable goods inflation, the slowdown in services inflation continued, led by items that experienced a disruption in activity due to the pandemic. Consequently, the trends of core indicators posted a slight uptick.
2.    Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 1.59% to 12.87% in May. This rise was mainly driven by the unprocessed food group with an annual inflation that increased by 4.91 points. The fall in the prices of fresh fruits and vegetables that remained relatively limited compared to previous years due to period-specific developments and the price hikes in eggs and pulses that are highly sensitive to the exchange rate were the main factors that had an adverse impact on the unprocessed food inflation. While monthly inflation in the processed food group decelerated slightly, annual inflation declined significantly on the back of the base effect. Meanwhile, leading indicators suggest that annual unprocessed food inflation may also rise in June.
3.    Energy prices increased by 2.13% in May and annual energy inflation rose by 1.93 points to 5.23%. The recovery in international oil prices along with the depreciation of the Turkish lira determined the rise in energy prices. Leading indicators suggest that annual energy inflation may rise in June.
4.    Annual core goods inflation increased by 1.38 points to 9.26% in May. In this period, both durable consumption goods and clothing and footwear prices posted significant increases. While in the durable goods group increases in the prices of automobiles and white goods driven by the cumulative depreciation of the Turkish lira were noteworthy, the clothing and footwear group saw a price increase above seasonal averages.
5.    Services prices increased by 0.73% in May, and annual services inflation edged down by 0.48 points to 11.28%. The limiting effects of the pandemic on services prices started to be felt in this period. As a matter of fact, while the most noticeable decline in annual inflation was seen in restaurants-hotels, the operations of which were interrupted significantly, annual inflation in other services and rents also posted a decline. The capacity limitations in transport services applied as part of gradual normalization steps led to an increase in annual transport inflation through the channel of unit costs.
6.    While inflation expectations for the year-end increased slightly, those for the next 12 months declined in June. 
Factors Afecting Inflation 
7.    The weakening in economic activity became more pronounced in April and spread across sectors. The industrial production, adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects, contracted by 30.4% month-on-month in April. The decline in the production of the main exporting sectors, primarily motor vehicles, wearing apparel and textiles, became more discernible. In the same period, while tourism revenues almost came to a halt due to travel restrictions, services sectors, in particular trade, accommodation-food and transport-storage services, experienced a drastic deceleration due to the measures taken against the pandemic.    
8.    Economic recovery has started as of May following gradual steps towards normalization. The relief of the restrictions on movement and improving credit conditions support domestic demand. While expenditures by cards for items with high sensitivity to financing conditions and deferred demand have soared, the consumption of electricity has also been increasing steadily. In the meantime, exports show an improvement across foreign trade partners, while the demand for imports has been increasing in line with the domestic demand. 
9.    Exports and tourism revenues declined on account of the deterioration in the global growth outlook and travel restrictions due to the pandemic. However, the recovery in exports of goods with the ongoing normalization and low levels of commodity prices will support the current account balance in the upcoming periods. The Committee underscored the importance of the course of the current account balance in terms of a lasting recovery in economic activity and in terms of macrofinancial stability.
10.    In order to contain negative effects of the pandemic on the Turkish economy, it is of crucial importance to ensure the healthy functioning of financial markets, the credit channel and firms’ cash flows. In this respect, the recent monetary and fiscal measures contribute to financial stability and economic recovery by supporting the potential output of the economy. The pace of the recovery in economic activity will depend on the course of the normalization process in Turkey as well as in the global economy.
11.    The slowdown in economic activity also had implications on the labor market data. The non-farm employment in March period decreased by 4.3% compared to February period, more apparently in the construction and services sectors. However, the increase in the unemployment rate remained relatively limited on the back of the decline in the labor force participation rate. Leading indicators reveal that new job posts increased and employment opportunities improved partially thanks to the improvement in economic activity. The Committee assessed that subsidies provided through the unemployment insurance fund and current transfers, short-time work allowance in particular, have played a critical role in limiting the income loss of households and maintaining employment.
Monetary Policy and Risks
12.    As developments regarding the spread of the coronavirus substantially weakened global growth in the second quarter, normalization steps taken by several countries have contributed to a partial recovery. Nevertheless, due to the continued spread of the pandemic primarily in the southern hemisphere and the likelihood of a second wave, uncertainties on global economic recovery remain high. Uncertainties remain regarding the possible effects of the outbreak and health measures on consumption habits and general spending behavior. A prolonged normalization phase could translate into a much weaker global and domestic growth outlook, calling for additional response measures.
13.    In the period following the MPC meeting, oil prices posted a recovery over the agreement of OPEC+ countries on supply cut and the expectations that the worst is over on the demand side. However, there remain downside risks to commodity prices, particularly due to the uncertainty about the global economic activity, and global inflation rates are expected to be moderate throughout 2020.
14.    Central banks in advanced and emerging economies continue to take expansionary measures. Long-term interest rates fell to historic lows across advanced economies, and both central bank statements and market expectations suggest that the low-rate environment is likely to continue for a long period. The effectiveness of these policies for financial markets, growth and employment will depend on the course of the pandemic in each country and how much policy room each country has.
15.    Accommodative policy measures and steps towards normalization have driven the risk appetite slightly higher, slowing down portfolio outflows from emerging markets. Following the normalization steps, and also thanks to recent monetary and financial measures, the adverse effects of global developments on Turkey’s risk premium and exchange rate volatility somewhat eased. However, the ongoing uncertainties over the global economic outlook and effectiveness of policy measures might lead to fluctuations in the global risk appetite and portfolio flows to emerging economies. As uncertainty still reigns, the pandemic disease is closely monitored for its evolving global impact on capital flows, financial conditions, international trade and commodity prices. Thus, the CBRT will continue to monitor the effects of the pandemic on the Turkish economy and use the tools at its disposal in pursuit of its price stability and financial stability objectives.
16.    Monetary, financial and fiscal measures introduced to address the pandemic, as well as the expansion of loan supply, mostly by state-owned banks, have mitigated downside risks to loan growth and contributed to the uninterrupted flow of credit to the real sector. The momentum of loan growth remains robust thanks to guaranteed loans facility, as well as supporting packages for construction, tourism and domestic manufacturing sectors. Guaranteed loans, led by state-owned banks in particular, propped up commercial and personal loan supply and helped bring interest rates further down, thus alleviating the negative effects of the pandemic on income and cash flows of economic units. Recently announced personal loan packages also helped boost the demand for housing loans.
17.    Despite the restraining effects of aggregate demand conditions, the pandemic-related rise in unit costs have led to some increase in the trends of core inflation indicators. International commodity prices have continued to restrain consumer inflation, while food inflation has risen due to seasonal and pandemic-related effects.  As the normalization process continues, supply-side factors, which have prevailed recently due to pandemic-related restrictions, will phase out and demand-driven disinflationary effects will become more prevalent in the second half of the year. Accordingly, considering all factors affecting the inflation outlook, the Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged.
18.    The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is a key factor for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, the monetary stance will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives.
19.    The Committee assessed that it is essential to sustain the coordination between monetary and fiscal policies to minimize the pandemic-related economic risks. The multifaceted effects of the pandemic on the economy call for coordinated policy actions aiming particularly at smoothing cash flows and stabilizing employment in order to minimize the impact on firms and households. Therefore, it is considered to be of critical importance that macro-scale monetary and fiscal policies be complemented with policy measures that target the most-affected economic units and consider sectoral interactions. Meanwhile, ensuring that policy measures are designed in a targeted and temporary fashion would support policy effectiveness.
20.    It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance."

Press Release on FX Reserve Requirement Ratios
FX reserve requirement ratios have been increased by 300 basis points in all liability types and maturity brackets for all banks.
Within the context of the measures announced on 17 March 2020 to contain the adverse effects of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, FX reserve requirement ratios were reduced by 500 basis points for banks that met real credit growth conditions, and USD 5.1 billion of liquidity was released. Additionally, banks that met real credit growth conditions for the first time were provided with approximately USD 9.2 billion of liquidity, and thus, a total amount of USD 14.3 billion of liquidity was provided to the banking system.
This time, as part of the normalization process, in order to support financial stability, the CBRT has decided to increase FX reserve requirement ratios by 300 basis points in all liability types and maturity brackets for all banks.
As a result of this decision, approximately USD 9.2 billion of FX and gold liquidity is expected to be withdrawn from the market.
The aforementioned change will take effect from the calculation date of 10 July 2020 with the maintenance period starting on 24 July 2020.

29 July 2020
Press Release on Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 23 July 2020
Inflation Developments 
1.    In June, consumer prices increased by 1.13% and annual inflation rose by 1.23 points to 12.62%. In this period, annual inflation was down in processed food, but edged further up in unprocessed food, keeping food inflation flat. Despite rising on the back of international crude oil prices, energy inflation continued to restrain consumer inflation. Cumulative exchange rate effects, the pandemic-driven increase in unit costs, and the rising demand for certain sectors amid stronger credit supply drove core goods inflation higher. Meanwhile, services inflation went up due to items affected by normalization process. Consequently, the annual inflation rates and trends of core indicators increased.
2.    Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 0.06 points to 12.93%. The soaring annual inflation in vegetables pushed annual unprocessed food inflation up by 2.15 points to 12.29%. On the other unprocessed food front, prices of pulses, dried fruits and nuts and rice continued to climb in June, whereas prices of red meat saw a downtick after having soared in recent months. Processed food prices posted a modest monthly increase and annual processed food inflation fell by 2.09 points to 13.41% amid base effects.
3.    Energy prices increased by 2.62% in June and annual energy inflation rose by 3.89 points to 9.12%. The ongoing recovery in international oil prices was the main driver of the rise in energy prices. There was also a notable increase in municipal water rates.
4.    Annual core goods inflation increased by 2.14 points to 11.39% in June. In this period, annual inflation was up across all subcategories. Prices were driven higher by cumulative exchange rate effects, pandemic-driven unit cost increases and the growing demand for certain subcategories due to favorable credit conditions. Therefore, price hikes were more significant in automobiles, white goods and other electrical and non-electrical appliances. Meanwhile, price increases in clothing and footwear exceeded seasonal averages in June.
5.    Prices of services increased by 2.09% in June, and annual services inflation rose by 0.48 points to 11.76%, largely due to sectors facing capacity constraints amid gradual normalization, with transport and restaurants-hotels in the lead. In fact, the largest increase in annual inflation was recorded for transport. Other subcategories with higher annual inflation included catering services, accommodation, and items of other services such as package tours and personal grooming services. In this period, inflation remained low in communication, while annual rent inflation continued to decline.
6.    Year-end and 12-month-ahead inflation expectations were up in July while 24-month-ahead expectations remained flat.
Factors Affecting Inflation
7.    Recent data releases confirmed that economic activity started to bottom out in May. Adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects, the industrial production index was up 17.6% month-on-month. Likewise, turnover indices showed that the decline in non-industrial sectors halted. However, as the March-April contraction was only partially compensated, economic activity seems to have been weak in May.
8.    Economic recovery, which started in May following gradual steps towards normalization, is gaining pace. Improving credit conditions support domestic demand. While expenditures by cards for items with high sensitivity to financing conditions and deferred demand have increased briskly, the consumption of electricity has also been increasing steadily. On the other hand, the weak course continues in services groups hardest hit by the pandemic, such as transportation, accommodation, and catering services.
9.    High-frequency data indicate that the recovery in the foreign trade volume continues, most visibly in exports. The improvement in exports spreads across all regions and sectors. Although tourism revenues declined due to the pandemic, easing travel restrictions are expected to contribute to a partial improvement. Indeed, credit card spending by foreigners and other high-frequency data carry signals, albeit still weak, for a recovery from trough in tourism activity. The recovery in exports of goods and low levels of commodity prices will support the current account balance in the upcoming periods. The Committee underscored the importance of the course of the current account balance in terms of a lasting recovery in economic activity and in terms of macrofinancial stability.
10.    In light of currently available data, economic activity is expected to post a significant improvement in the third quarter. Recent monetary and fiscal measures that aim to contain negative effects of the pandemic on the Turkish economy contribute to financial stability and economic recovery by supporting the potential output of the economy. 
11.    In the April period, employment losses continued to be registered across all sectors, the services sector in particular, and unemployment rates rose. The decline in the labor force participation rate continued to limit the rise in unemployment rates. Leading indicators reveal that new job posts increased and employment opportunities improved partially thanks to the improvement in economic activity. The Committee assessed that subsidies provided through the unemployment insurance fund and current transfers, short-time work allowance in particular, have played a critical role in limiting the income loss of households and maintaining employment.
Monetary Policy and Risks
12.    Developments regarding the spread of the coronavirus substantially weakened global growth in the second quarter. While global economic activity has shown signs of partial recovery in the third quarter following the normalization steps taken by several countries, uncertainties on global economic recovery remain high due to the continued spread of the pandemic and the likelihood of a second wave. Moreover, uncertainties remain regarding the possible effects of the outbreak and health measures on consumption habits and general spending behavior. If the normalization takes longer or a second wave of the pandemic strikes in the period ahead, the nascent recovery in global economy may be interrupted and there may be fluctuations in the global risk appetite. 
13.    In the period following the June MPC meeting, crude oil prices mildly increased due to the recovering global activity as well as OPEC+ countries’ tapering of supply cuts as part of the second phase of the agreement they reached in April. Still, the current level of oil prices is below the levels in the pre-pandemic period. On the other hand, there remain downside risks to commodity prices, particularly due to the uncertainty about the global economic activity, and global inflation rates are expected to be moderate throughout 2020. 
14.    Advanced and emerging economies continue to take expansionary monetary and fiscal measures. While long-term interest rates remain at historic lows across advanced economies, both central bank statements and market expectations suggest that the low-rate environment is likely to continue for a long period. The effectiveness of these policies for financial markets, growth and employment will depend on the course of the pandemic in each country and how much policy room each country has.
15.    Although accommodative policy measures and steps towards normalization have driven the risk appetite slightly higher recently, portfolio flows to emerging markets remain weak. The ongoing uncertainties over the global economic outlook might lead to fluctuations in the global risk appetite and portfolio flows to emerging economies. The negative effects of global developments have somewhat eased in the recent period but global uncertainties remain high. In this respect, the pandemic disease is closely monitored for its evolving global impact on capital flows, financial conditions, international trade and commodity prices. The CBRT will continue to monitor the effects of the pandemic on the Turkish economy and use the tools at its disposal in pursuit of its price stability and financial stability objectives.
16.    Monetary, financial and fiscal measures as well as the credit expansion, driven mostly by state-owned banks, make a significant contribution to the uninterrupted flow of credit to the real sector and the economic recovery process. Loan growth, which gained momentum thanks to the guaranteed loans facility and predominantly in line with firms’ demand, remains robust due to personal loan packages offered by state-owned banks following the saturation of firms’ loan demand as well as due to the realization of consumers’ deferred demand. Loan growth and loan composition are closely monitored for their impact on domestic and external balance. 
17.    Despite the restraining effects of aggregate demand conditions, pandemic-related rise in unit costs have led to an increase in the trends of core inflation indicators. International commodity prices have continued to restrain consumer inflation, while food inflation has risen due to seasonal and pandemic-related effects. As the normalization process continues, supply-side factors, which have prevailed recently due to pandemic-related restrictions, will phase out. Indeed, leading indicators show that monthly price increases have started to slow down in services groups that have been subject to capacity constraints during the normalization process. The Committee maintains the view that demand-driven disinflationary effects will become more prevalent in the second half of the year, but risks to the end-year projection are considered to be on the upside due to recent realizations in inflation. Accordingly, considering all factors affecting the inflation outlook, the Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged.
18.    The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is a key factor for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, monetary stance will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives. Accordingly, accommodative liquidity measures implemented since March may be revised in a gradual manner, depending on how the normalization evolves. 
19.    Fiscal policy actions, along with other monetary and financial measures taken during the pandemic, have supported the potential output of the economy by limiting the pandemic-related economic risks and significantly contributed to the start of a recovery in economic activity. Sustaining the coordination between monetary and fiscal policies during the recovery process, and determining the macro policy mix in a way that will ensure the continuation of the disinflation process while supporting the current account balance are crucial for maintaining healthy and stable growth. In the upcoming period, temporary and targeted fiscal and quasi-fiscal policy actions will be critical to support the sectors in which the recovery may take longer due to pandemic-related effects. 
20.    It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance."

The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 8.25 percent.
While global economic activity has shown signs of partial recovery in the third quarter following the normalization steps taken by several countries, uncertainties on global economic recovery remain high. Advanced and emerging economies continue to maintain expansionary monetary and fiscal stances. The pandemic disease is closely monitored for its evolving global impact on capital flows, financial conditions, international trade and commodity prices.
Economic recovery, which started in May following gradual steps towards normalization, is gaining pace. Recent monetary and fiscal measures that aim to contain negative effects of the pandemic on the Turkish economy contributed to financial stability and economic recovery by supporting the potential output of the economy. While commercial loans have recently started to normalize, consumer loans have remained strong. The recent upturn in imports, which has resulted from deferred demand as well as pandemic-related liquidity and credit policies, is expected to moderate with the phasing out of these policy measures. Although tourism revenues declined due to the pandemic, easing of travel restrictions has started to contribute to a partial improvement. The recovery in exports of goods, relatively low levels of commodity prices and the level of the real exchange rate will support the current account balance in the upcoming periods.
Along with the pandemic-related rise in unit costs, exchange rate and credit developments restrain the demand-side disinflationary effects, and the trends of core inflation indicators have increased. As the normalization process continues, supply-side factors, which have prevailed recently due to pandemic-related restrictions, will phase out. The gradual normalization of pandemic-specific financial measures and recent tightening steps taken in liquidity management are judged to support macrofinancial stability. However, depending on the course of the pandemic, uncertainties regarding domestic and external demand conditions remain significant. Accordingly, the Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged, while continuing with liquidity measures.
The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is a key factor for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, monetary stance will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

Press Release on Reserve Requirement Ratios
TL and FX reserve requirement ratios have been raised for banks fulfilling real credit growth conditions.
As part of the normalization process, in its press release of 18 July 2020, the CBRT announced that it increased FX reserve requirement ratios by 300 basis points in all liability types and maturity brackets for all banks. Now, the CBRT has decided to raise FX reserve requirement ratios for banks fulfilling real credit growth conditions by 700 basis points for precious metal deposit accounts and by 200 basis points for all other FX liabilities for all maturity brackets.
Moreover, in line with the recent steps taken towards the Turkish lira liquidity management, for banks fulfilling the real credit growth conditions: TL reserve requirement ratios have been increased by 200 basis points for all deposits / participation funds liabilities with a maturity up to 6 months and other liabilities with a maturity up to 1 year, and by 150 basis points for other liabilities with a maturity up to 3 years.
As a result of this decision, approximately TRY 17 billion and USD 8.5 billion of FX and gold liquidity is expected to be withdrawn from the market.
Thus, with the revision made on 18 July 2020 and this current arrangement, USD 17.7 billion of FX and gold liquidity, which has been injected into the market since 17 March 2020 due to the reduction of FX reserve requirement ratios and the fulfilment of real credit growth conditions by some banks for the first time, will be fully withdrawn as part of the normalization.
These changes will be effective from the calculation date of 21 August 2020 with the maintenance period starting on 4 September 2020.

Press Release on Turkish QR Code Rules and Principles
The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) has established Turkey’s QR code standards as part of intentional efforts to support innovative methods of executing and handling payments. 
National rules and principles for the standardized “TR QR Code” aim to enhance the use of a common QR code in retail payments, initiate practical, easier, more efficient and safer payments, and thus help to reduce use of physical cash in the form of banknotes.  
Against this backdrop, a standard QR code structure and set of rules have been established to enable interoperability by using a common language among payment system operators within the payments infrastructure ecosystem, support all sorts of initiatives from innovators, and contribute to the widespread acceptance of QR codes in the form of digital payments. 
This initiative is also directed to support the use of contactless and electronic payment methods, whose importance has been increasing because of coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic that affected the whole financial provisions in the world during and beyond 2020.
The “Regulation on the Generation and Use of TR QR Code in Payment Services” including its annex “TR QR Code Rules and Principles” prepared as part of the same initiatives have entered into force following their publication in the Official Gazette No. 31220 dated 21 August 2020.

27 August 2020
Press Release on Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 20 August 2020
Inflation Developments 
1.    In July, consumer prices edged up by 0.58% and annual inflation dropped by 0.86 points to 11.76%. The decline in annual inflation stemmed from base effects led by tax adjustments made in the same month of the previous year, while the underlying trend of inflation remained on an upward track due to cost factors such as exchange rates and import prices as well as the strong credit impulse. 
2.    Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages fell by 0.20 points to 12.73%. The fruit group pushed annual unprocessed food inflation up by 1.56 points to 13.85%. While unprocessed food prices remained flat, the rise in egg prices stood out, and pulse prices, which displayed a significant increase in the first half of the year, declined. In July, processed food prices posted a mild outlook and annual processed food inflation fell by 1.77 points to 11.64% with the support of base effects. 
3.    Energy prices rose by 2.50% in July and annual energy inflation fell by 0.55 points to 8.57%. The recovery in international oil prices was the main driver of the rise in energy prices, which was accompanied by an increase in municipal water rates. Despite the monthly price increase, group’s annual inflation declined owing to the base effect led by the adjustment in electricity prices last year, which is among administered prices.
4.    Annual core goods inflation decreased by 2.81 points to 8.58% in July due to the durable goods group. Despite the price hikes in furniture, automobiles and other electrical and non-electrical appliances, annual inflation was down by 5.65 points to 9.98% due to the base effects led by tax adjustments in the previous year. Meanwhile, there were price cuts close to seasonal averages in clothing and footwear group, whereas the other core goods prices registered mild increases.
5.    Prices of services increased by 1.06% in July and annual services inflation rose by 0.04 points to 11.80%. Annual inflation decreased in rent, restaurants-hotels and transport, but increased in communication and other services. Pandemic-driven unit cost increases continued, albeit with a diminishing pace. Accordingly, prices in the restaurants-hotels group decelerated month-on-month, yet recorded a high increase. Transport services prices declined on a monthly basis.
6.    In August, short and medium-term inflation expectations remained on an upward track. According to the CBRT Survey of Expectations, the year-end and 12-month-ahead inflation expectations were revised upwards from 10.22% to 10.82% and from 9.33% to 9.70%, respectively. In addition to survey-based indicators of inflation expectations, inflation compensation obtained from bond yields also picked up.
Factor Affecting Inflation
7.    Economic recovery, which started in May following gradual steps towards normalization, is gaining pace. Adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects, the industrial production index was up 17.6% in June month-on-month. Turnover indices showed that sectoral diffusion of recovery has started to pick up. Moreover, positive signals for recovery in the services sector have increased, which are observed with a lag compared to those in the industrial sector.
8.    Survey indicators as well as high-frequency data for the third quarter suggest a notable recovery in the economy after a sizeable contraction in the second quarter. Recent monetary and fiscal measures that aim to contain negative effects of the pandemic on the Turkish economy contributed to financial stability and economic recovery by supporting the potential output of the economy. While commercial loans have recently started to normalize, consumer loans have remained strong and supported domestic demand. Deferred expenditures for items with high sensitivity to financing conditions have remained robust, while electricity consumption has also recorded a steady rise. Meanwhile, services groups hardest hit by the pandemic such as transport, accommodation and food and beverages are picking up but continue to remain relatively weak.
9.    High-frequency data indicate a sustained recovery in exports and a significant acceleration in imports. The recent upturn in imports, which has resulted from deferred demand as well as pandemic-related liquidity and credit policies, is expected to moderate with the gradual phasing down of these policy measures. Although tourism revenues declined due to the pandemic, easing of travel restrictions has started to contribute to a partial improvement. The recovery in exports of goods, relatively low levels of commodity prices and the level of the real exchange rate will support the current account balance in the upcoming periods. The Committee underscored the importance of the course of the current account balance in terms of a lasting recovery in economic activity and macrofinancial stability. Accordingly, effects of the recent measures on credit growth and composition and external balance are monitored closely.
10.    While there are signs of partial improvement in the labor market due to economic recovery as well as the measures taken, unemployment rates continued to rise in the May period. In this period, non-farm employment receded further due to the services sector, while construction employment increased. After a downtrend for a while, the labor force participation rate remained flat. Leading indicators reveal that new job posts increased and employment opportunities continued to improve. The Committee assessed that subsidies provided through the   unemployment insurance fund and current transfers, short-time work allowance in particular, have played a critical role in limiting the income loss of households and maintaining employment.
Monetary Policy and Risks
11.    While global economic activity has shown signs of partial recovery in the third quarter following the normalization steps taken by several countries, uncertainties on recovery remain high due to the continued spread of the pandemic and the possibility of a second wave.  Moreover, uncertainties remain regarding the possible effects of the outbreak and health measures on consumption habits and general spending behavior. In case normalization takes a long time or a second wave in the pandemic is seen in the upcoming period, the nascent recovery in global economy may be interrupted and fluctuations in the global risk appetite may be observed. 
12.    In the period following the July MPC meeting, crude oil prices continued to increase modestly on the back of recovering global activity. Still, the current level of oil prices is below the levels in the pre-pandemic period. On the other hand, there remain downside risks to commodity prices, particularly due to the uncertainty about the global economic activity, and global inflation rates are expected to be moderate throughout 2020. 
13.    Advanced and emerging economies continue to maintain expansionary monetary and fiscal stances. While long-term interest rates remain at historic lows across advanced economies, both central bank statements and market expectations suggest that the low-rate environment is likely to continue for a long period. The effectiveness of these policies for financial markets, growth and employment will depend on the course of the pandemic in each country and how much policy room each country has.
14.    Portfolio flows to emerging economies proved more favorable than the previous month. In August, inflows to bond markets were moderate, while outflows from stock markets declined month-on-month. However, ongoing uncertainties over the global economic outlook might lead to fluctuations in the global risk appetite and portfolio flows to emerging economies. In fact, Turkey’s risk premium is fluctuating due to pandemic-driven global uncertainties and country-specific factors. During this period marked with high uncertainties, the pandemic disease is closely monitored for its evolving global impact on capital flows, financial conditions, international trade and commodity prices. Against this background, the CBRT will continue to monitor the effects of the pandemic on the Turkish economy and use the tools at its disposal in pursuit of its price stability and financial stability objectives.
15.    Monetary, financial and fiscal measures as well as the credit expansion, driven mostly by state-owned banks, made a significant contribution to the uninterrupted flow of credit to the real sector and the economic recovery process. Thus, the economy’s production potential was supported and economic activity has started to recover significantly since May. The Committee, considering the rebound in the economy and its reflections into macro balances, assessed that conditions have evolved to allow for gradual withdrawal of the pandemic-specific supportive macro-policy steps.
16.    Within the scope of liquidity measures taken in this regard, targeted additional liquidity facilities started to be gradually phased down. In addition, one-week repo auctions were suspended as of August 7; liquidity limits offered to primary dealers were first reduced to half, and then zero; banks’ borrowing limits at the CBRT Interbank Money Market for overnight transactions were reduced to half. As part of the tightening steps taken under liquidity management, traditional repo auctions started on August 13. These steps will continue to increase the weighted average funding cost in the upcoming period.
17.    In line with the monetary tightening steps, the Turkish lira and FX reserve requirement ratios are raised for banks fulfilling real credit growth conditions. In this context, required reserve ratios applied to precious metal deposit accounts were set higher. Upon these decisions, a significant part of the liquidity provided through the accommodative measures implemented since March will be withdrawn. Normalization of the measures taken to contain the adverse effects of the pandemic and the tightening steps in liquidity policies have led to an increase in loan and deposit rates, and loan growth has started to decelerate. Loan growth and loan composition continue to be monitored closely for their impact on domestic and external balance. 
18.    Along with the pandemic-related rise in unit costs, exchange rate and credit developments restrain the demand-side disinflationary effects, and the trends of core inflation indicators have increased. Leading indicators for August suggest a sustained rise in the trend of inflation. As the normalization process continues, supply-side factors, which have prevailed recently due to pandemic-related restrictions, will phase out, yet the recent developments pose risks to the pricing behavior. In this respect, the gradual normalization of pandemic-specific financial measures and the recent tightening steps taken in liquidity management are judged to support macrofinancial stability. However, depending on the course of the pandemic, uncertainties regarding domestic and external demand conditions remain significant. Accordingly, the Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged, while continuing with liquidity measures.
19.    The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is a key factor for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, monetary stance will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives.
20.    Fiscal policy actions, along with other monetary and financial measures taken during the pandemic, have supported the potential output of the economy by limiting the pandemic-related economic risks and significantly contributed to the start of a recovery in economic activity. Sustaining the coordination between monetary and fiscal policies during the recovery process, and determining the macro policy mix in a way that will ensure the continuation of the disinflation process while supporting the current account balance are crucial for maintaining healthy and stable growth. In the upcoming period, temporary and targeted fiscal and quasi-fiscal policy actions will be critical to support the sectors in which the recovery may take longer due to pandemic-related effects. 
21.    It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance."

Participating Committee Members

The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to increase the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 8.25 percent to 10.25 percent.
While global economic activity has shown signs of partial recovery in the third quarter following the normalization steps taken by several countries, uncertainties on global economic recovery remain high. Advanced and emerging economies continue to maintain expansionary monetary and fiscal stances. The pandemic disease is closely monitored for its evolving global impact on capital flows, financial conditions, international trade and commodity prices.
Economic activity is recovering markedly in the third quarter owing to gradual steps towards normalization and the strong credit impulse. Recent monetary and fiscal measures that aim to contain negative effects of the pandemic on the Turkish economy contributed to financial stability and economic recovery by supporting the potential output of the economy. The normalization trend recently observed in commercial loans has started in consumer loans as well. The recent upturn in imports, which has resulted from deferred demand as well as pandemic-related liquidity and credit policies, is expected to moderate with the phasing out of these policy measures. Although tourism revenues declined due to the pandemic, easing of travel restrictions has started to contribute to a partial improvement. The recovery in exports of goods, relatively low levels of commodity prices and the level of the real exchange rate will support the current account balance in the upcoming periods.
Pandemic-related supply-side inflationary factors were expected to gradually phase out during the normalization process and demand-driven disinflationary effects were expected to become more prevalent. Yet, as a result of fast economic recovery with strong credit momentum, and financial market developments, inflation followed a higher-than-envisaged path. The Committee assessed that the tightening steps taken since August should be reinforced in order to contain inflation expectations and risks to the inflation outlook. Accordingly, the Committee decided to increase the policy rate by 200 basis points to restore the disinflation process and support price stability.
The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is a key factor for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, monetary stance will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives.

1 October 2020
Press Release on Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 24 September 2020
Inflation Developments 
1.    In August, consumer prices rose by 0.86% and annual inflation remained flat at 11.77%. While annual inflation rose in core goods, energy and food groups, it remained unchanged in the services group. Meanwhile, annual inflation in the alcoholic beverages and tobacco group declined significantly due to the high base from tobacco products. In this period, annual inflation rates and trends of core indicators registered a rise.
2.    Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 0.78 points to 13.51% in August. The rise in annual unprocessed food inflation by 1.51 points to 15.36% was the main driver of this increase. Seasonally adjusted data indicate that rise in the prices of fresh fruits and vegetables were prominent in the unprocessed food group. Annual inflation in the processed food group increased by 0.22 points to 11.86%. This uptick was led by the bread and cereals group, while annual inflation in the other processed food group remained flat.   
3.    Energy prices rose by 1.29% in August and the group’s annual inflation increased by 1.02 points to 9.59%. In line with the increases in exchange rates and international oil prices, the rise in fuel prices pushed energy inflation up. Municipal water tariffs climbed further in August, another factor that negatively affected the group’s inflation. However, the high base driven by the previous year’s adjustment to administered natural gas prices limited inflation in this group.
4.    Annual core goods inflation increased by 1.44 points to 10.02% in August due to exchange rate developments, as well as stronger demand conditions on the back of the credit impulse. Annual inflation in durable goods, which is characterized by high exchange rate pass-through, climbed by 3.09 points to 13.07%, and leading indicators showed that high price hikes continued across subcategories in September. In August, prices of other core goods posted an uptick, while seasonal discounts in the clothing and footwear group were higher compared to the last year. 
5.    Services prices rose by 1.14% in August and annual group inflation remained flat at 11.83%. While annual inflation increased in restaurants-hotels and communication services, it declined in other groups. The fall in the annual inflation of transport services was mainly driven by intercity passenger transportation. The restaurants-hotels group posted price hikes both in catering and, more significantly, in accommodation services. While the increase in the prices of exchange-rate-sensitive items in the other services group was notable, the monthly increase in educational services remained limited. Meanwhile, the VAT cut on educational services is expected to have a favorable effect on prices in the upcoming period.
6.    Annual inflation in the alcohol-tobacco group dropped by 19.34 points to 2.44% in August. In this period, alcoholic beverage prices rose by 2.58%, while tobacco prices, despite remaining flat, drove the annual inflation in this group significantly down due to the high base. Meanwhile, in response to international prices and exchange rate developments, gold prices registered a monthly increase of 13.72%, thereby contributing to annual consumer inflation by 1.01 points.
7.    In September, inflation expectations continued to increase. The year-end inflation expectation rose by 64 basis points to 11.46%, and the 12-month-ahead inflation expectation increased by 45 basis points to 10.15%. 
Factors Affecting Inflation 
8.    Economic activity is recovering markedly in the third quarter owing to gradual steps towards normalization and the strong credit impulse. Adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects, the industrial production index picked up by 8.4% in July month-on-month and converged to the pre-pandemic level. Survey indicators and high-frequency data indicate that economic activity gained strength in August and September. Turnover indices showed that sectoral diffusion of the recovery continues to widen, while economic activity remains relatively weak in some sectors restrained by tourism and export outlook.
9.    Recent monetary and fiscal measures that aim to contain negative effects of the pandemic on the Turkish economy contributed to financial stability and economic recovery by supporting the potential output of the economy. Nevertheless, tightening steps through liquidity management have been taken since August in order to contain the adverse effects of the rapid rebound in domestic demand, led by strong credit impulse, on external balance and inflation. Accordingly, the normalization trend recently observed in commercial loans has started in consumer loans as well.
10.    Exports continue to recover across regions and sectors, and reached pre-pandemic levels in September in seasonally and calendar adjusted terms. However, imports, which accelerated markedly in August, lost some pace in September and export/import coverage ratio excluding gold remained quite high. The recent upturn in imports, which has resulted from deferred demand as well as pandemic-related liquidity and credit policies, is expected to moderate with the phasing out of these policy measures. Although tourism revenues declined due to the pandemic, easing of travel restrictions has started to contribute to a partial improvement. The recovery in exports of goods, relatively low levels of commodity prices and the level of the real exchange rate will support the current account balance in the upcoming periods. The Committee underscored the importance of the course of the current account balance in terms of a lasting recovery in economic activity and macrofinancial stability. Accordingly, effects of the recent measures on credit growth and composition and external balance are monitored closely.
11.    Adverse conditions in the labor market have started to subside in the June period, and non-farm employment recorded an increase across sectors. Meanwhile, the labor force participation rate, which has recently displayed a significant downward trend, improved on the back of economic recovery, and unemployment rates increased compared to the previous period. Leading indicators reveal that new job posts increased and employment opportunities continued to improve. The Committee assessed that subsidies provided through the unemployment insurance fund and current transfers, short-time work allowance in particular, have played a critical role in limiting the income loss of households and maintaining employment.
Monetary Policy and Risks
12.    While global economic activity has shown signs of partial recovery in the third quarter following the normalization steps taken by several countries, uncertainties on global economic recovery remain high due to the continued spread of the pandemic and the possibility of a second wave. Moreover, uncertainties remain regarding the possible effects of the outbreak and health measures on consumption habits and general spending behavior. In case normalization takes a long time or a second wave in the pandemic breaks out in the upcoming period, the nascent recovery in global economy may be interrupted and fluctuations in the global risk appetite may be observed. 
13.    In the period following the August MPC meeting, crude oil prices receded slightly and downside risks on prices increased. The current level of oil prices is below the levels in the pre-pandemic period. On the other hand, there remain downside risks to commodity prices, particularly due to the uncertainty about the global economic activity, and global inflation rates are expected to be moderate throughout 2020. 
14.    Advanced and emerging economies continue to maintain expansionary monetary and fiscal stances. While long-term interest rates remain at historic lows across advanced economies, both central bank statements and market expectations suggest that the low-rate environment is likely to continue for a long period. The effectiveness of these policies for financial markets, growth and employment will depend on the course of the pandemic in each country and how much policy room each country has.
15.    Portfolio inflows to emerging economies have increased since the previous MPC meeting due to improved risk sentiment. Inflows to bond markets observed since June increased significantly in September, while flows to equity markets remained relatively weak and volatile. The Fed’s new policy framework and forward guidance reinforced the perception that the policy rate will remain low, which is considered to improve portfolio flows to emerging economies. However, ongoing uncertainties over the global economic outlook might lead to fluctuations in the global risk appetite and portfolio flows to emerging economies. In fact, Turkey’s risk premium is fluctuating due to pandemic-driven global uncertainties and country-specific factors. During this period marked with high uncertainties, the pandemic disease is closely monitored for its evolving global impact on capital flows, financial conditions, international trade and commodity prices. Against this background, the CBRT will continue to monitor the effects of the pandemic on the Turkish economy and use the tools at its disposal in pursuit of its price stability and financial stability objectives.
16.    Monetary, financial and fiscal measures as well as the credit expansion, led by state-owned banks, made a significant contribution to the uninterrupted flow of credit to the real sector and the economic recovery process. Thus, the economy’s production potential was supported and economic activity has started to recover significantly since May. The Committee, considering the rebound in the economy and its reflections into macro balances, decided to gradually withdraw the pandemic-specific supportive macro-policy measures since August.
17.    Normalization of the measures taken to contain the adverse effects of the pandemic and the tightening steps in liquidity policies have led to an increase in loan and deposit rates, and loan growth has started to decelerate. Amid the policy normalization, the deceleration which had started in commercial loans, started to be observed in retail loans as well during this month. Loan growth and loan composition continue to be monitored closely for their impact on domestic and external balance. 
18.    The Committee underlined the ongoing high inflation trend and evaluated the factors that interrupted the disinflation process. Pandemic-related supply-side inflationary factors were expected to gradually phase out during the normalization process and demand-driven disinflationary effects were expected to become more prevalent. Pandemic-driven supply-side inflationary effects still persist, as normalization progresses gradually. Aggregate demand conditions continue to curb inflation in certain sectors, while price increases are high for goods that are sensitive to financing conditions. Thus, as a result of fast economic recovery with strong credit momentum and financial market developments, inflation followed a higher-than-envisaged path. The ongoing rise in inflation expectations poses a risk to pricing behavior and medium-term inflation outlook. The Committee assessed that the tightening steps taken since August should be reinforced in order to contain inflation expectations and risks to the inflation outlook. Accordingly, the Committee decided to increase the policy rate by 200 basis points to restore the disinflation process and support price stability.
19.    The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation is a key factor for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, monetary stance will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives.
20.    Fiscal policy actions, along with other monetary and financial measures taken during the pandemic, have supported the potential output of the economy by limiting the pandemic-related economic risks and significantly contributed to the start of a recovery in economic activity. Sustaining the coordination between monetary and fiscal policies during the recovery process, and determining the macro policy mix in a way that will ensure the continuation of the disinflation process while supporting the current account balance are crucial for maintaining healthy and stable growth. In the upcoming period, temporary and targeted fiscal and quasi-fiscal policy actions will be critical to support the sectors in which the recovery may take longer due to pandemic-related effects. 
21.    It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance."

Participating Committee Members
Murat Uysal (Governor), Murat Çetinkaya, Ömer Duman, Uğur Namık Küçük, Oğuzhan Özbaş, Emrah Şener, Abdullah Yavaş.
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to:

keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 10.25 percent, and
adjust the monetary policy operational framework and set the margin between the CBRT Late Liquidity Window lending rate and overnight lending rate as 300 basis points.

While global economic activity has shown signs of partial recovery in the third quarter following the normalization steps taken by several countries, uncertainties on global economic recovery persist. Advanced and emerging economies continue to maintain expansionary monetary and fiscal stances. The pandemic disease is closely monitored for its evolving global impact on capital flows, financial conditions, international trade and commodity prices.
The recovery in economic activity continues. Following recent policy steps, the normalization trend observed in commercial and consumer loans has become more pronounced. The expected moderation in imports has started with the phasing out of pandemic-related supportive policies. The strong recovery in exports of goods, relatively low levels of commodity prices and the level of the real exchange rate will support the current account balance in the upcoming periods.
As a result of fast economic recovery with strong credit momentum, and financial market developments, inflation followed a higher-than-envisaged path. A significant tightening in financial conditions has been achieved, following the monetary policy and liquidity management steps taken to contain inflation expectations and risks to the inflation outlook. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged, while enhancing flexibility in liquidity management and continuing with liquidity measures until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement.
The Committee assesses that restoring the disinflation process is a key factor for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, monetary stance will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

2020,28 October 2020,Press Release on Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting,"2020-63
28 October 2020
Press Release on Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 22 October 2020
Inflation Developments 
1.    In September, consumer prices rose by 0.97% and annual inflation remained flat at 11.75%. In this period, annual inflation rose in the core goods and food groups, but declined in services and energy. In the core goods group, durable goods stood out with significant price increases in recent months, while the clothing and footwear group witnessed a weaker course in prices compared to seasonal averages. Seasonally adjusted data pointed to a relatively mild increase in services prices. Against this background, core indicators registered an uptick in annual inflation and maintained their high levels in trends, albeit some weakening.
2.    Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 1.44 points to 14.95% in September. Annual inflation rose both in the unprocessed and processed food groups by 2.11 points and 0.93 points to 17.47% and to 12.79%, respectively. The pick-up in the unprocessed food inflation was driven by the prices of fresh fruits and vegetables. On the processed food group front, price hikes in the bread and cereals group and fats and oils group were prominent.
3.    Energy prices rose by 0.50% in September, but the group’s annual inflation fell by 2.82 points to 6.77%. The base effect in natural gas prices was the main driver of this decline in annual energy inflation. International oil prices posted a decline in September, while the depreciation in the exchange rate inhibited a more favorable outlook in group inflation. Electricity prices used by the households, industry and businesses increased starting from October.
4.    In September, prices of core goods rose by 2.18% and the group’s annual inflation increased by 1.66 points to 11.68%. This was led by the durable goods group, which saw a price hike of 3.70% and an annual inflation reaching 17.38%. In durable goods with high exchange rate passthrough, strong demand conditions on the back of the credit impulse also proved notable in price increases. Other core goods also witnessed a similar course and prices rose by 1.54%. Meanwhile, prices of clothing and footwear diverged from the group, following a flat course. In this period, having displayed a weaker trend compared to seasonal averages, the clothing and footwear group saw a decline in annual inflation to 6.79%.
5.    Services prices rose by 0.58% in September and the group’s annual inflation fell by 0.99 points to 10.84%. Annual inflation declined in transport services, restaurants-hotels and rent, but increased in communication and other services. Annual inflation in transport services registered a significant decline, which was driven by the base effect as well as the plummeting intercity bus fares. Meanwhile, the depreciating exchange rate continued to affect the other services group. The VAT arrangement in educational services had a favorable impact on inflation in this group.
6.    In October, short and medium-term inflation expectations continued to increase. The year-end inflation expectation rose by 30 basis points to 11.76%, and the 12-month-ahead inflation expectation increased by 38 basis points to 10.53%.
Factors Affecting Inflation 
7.    The recovery in economic activity continues. The industrial production index picked up by 3.4% in August month-on-month and exceeded the pre-pandemic level. High-frequency data point to a sustained recovery in September and October. While economic activity continues to increase with a wide sectoral diffusion led by sectors sensitive to financing conditions, a relatively weak course persists in tourism and related sectors.
8.    Tightening steps through liquidity management have been taken since August in order to contain the adverse effects of the rapid rebound in domestic demand, led by strong credit impulse, on external balance and inflation. Accordingly, following recent policy steps, the normalization trend observed in commercial and consumer loans has become more pronounced. Although domestic demand is expected to slow down in the upcoming period with the stabilization of pandemic-specific supportive policies, the growth outlook for the whole year has improved significantly.
9.    Exports continue to recover on the back of the competitiveness gains as well as the rebound in global demand. Meanwhile, the expected moderation in imports has started with the phasing out of pandemic-related supportive policies. The export-to-import coverage ratio excluding gold remains high. The Committee considers that the additional import demand led by the strong credit impulse will lose pace in the period ahead and the balancing effects of the real exchange rate will become more apparent. Accordingly, the strong recovery in exports of goods, relatively low levels of commodity prices and the level of the real exchange rate will support the current account balance in the upcoming periods. The Committee underscored the importance of the course of the current account balance in terms of a lasting recovery in economic activity and macrofinancial stability.
10.    The recovery in economic activity has a positive effect on the labor market. In the July period, non-farm employment recorded an increase across sectors. Meanwhile, only half of the employment loss in the second quarter has been compensated for in seasonally adjusted terms. In this period, the labor force participation rate posted an increase on the back of economic recovery, and unemployment rates receded. Leading indicators reveal that new job posts increased and employment opportunities continued to improve. 
Monetary Policy and Risks
11.    While global economic activity has shown signs of partial recovery in the third quarter following the normalization steps taken by several countries, uncertainties on global economic recovery persist due to the continued spread of the pandemic. The recently elevated pandemic-related restrictions in the European countries keep downside risks to external demand and export outlook in place. Moreover, uncertainties remain regarding the possible effects of the pandemic and health measures on consumption habits and general spending behavior. In case normalization takes a long time or a second wave in the pandemic breaks out in the upcoming period, the nascent recovery in global economy may be interrupted and fluctuations in the global risk appetite may be observed. 
12.    In tandem with the subsided global economic activity, crude oil prices remained flat since the previous MPC meeting. The current level of oil prices is below the levels of the pre-pandemic period. On the other hand, there remain downside risks to commodity prices, particularly due to the uncertainty about the global economic activity, and global inflation rates are expected to be moderate in the upcoming period.
13.    Advanced and emerging economies maintain their expansionary monetary and fiscal stances. While long-term interest rates remain at historic lows across advanced economies, both central bank statements and market expectations suggest that the low-rate environment is likely to continue for a long period. The effectiveness of these policies for financial markets, growth and employment will depend on the course of the pandemic in each country and how much policy room each country has.
14.    Portfolio inflows to emerging economies have increased since the previous MPC meeting due to improved risk sentiment. However, excluding China, inflows to bond markets continued with a limited pace, while those to equity markets remained relatively weak. Reinforced perceptions that policy rates will remain low in advanced economies and possible incentive packages are considered to improve portfolio flows to emerging economies. However, ongoing uncertainties over the global economic outlook might lead to fluctuations in the global risk appetite and portfolio flows to emerging economies. In fact, Turkey’s risk premium is fluctuating due to pandemic-driven global uncertainties and country-specific factors. During this period marked with high uncertainties, the pandemic disease is closely monitored for its evolving global impact on capital flows, financial conditions, international trade and commodity prices. Against this background, the CBRT will continue to monitor the effects of the pandemic on the Turkish economy and use the tools at its disposal in pursuit of its price stability and financial stability objectives.
15.    The recovery stimulated by steps for gradual normalization in economic activity, which started in May, gained strength owing to supportive policies. Rapid credit growth contributed significantly to the economic recovery, and economic activity exceeded the pre-pandemic levels. The Committee, considering the rebound in the economy and its reflections to macro balances, decided to gradually withdraw the pandemic-specific supportive macro-policy measures since August. The gradual increase in the weighted average funding cost achieved by the steps for tightening in the monetary policy and the liquidity management and the balancing in the accomodative stance of state banks had fast and strong repercussions in loan rates. The rise in consumer loan rates proved more noticeable, while the normalization trend in commercial and consumer loans has recently become more pronounced. Presently, curbing risks to the inflation outlook is critical to the maintenance of a healthy and stable growth. Accordingly, the CBRT strengthened its tightening efforts as of August gradually with a view to containing inflation expectations, restoring the disinflation process and supporting price stability.
16.    As a result of fast economic recovery with strong credit momentum, and financial market developments, inflation followed a higher-than-envisaged path. A significant tightening in financial conditions has been achieved, following the monetary policy and liquidity management steps taken to contain inflation expectations and risks to the inflation outlook. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged, while enhancing flexibility in liquidity management and continuing with liquidity measures until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement. Tightening in financial conditions along with the deceleration in loan growth and the sustained uptrend in the weighted average funding cost in the upcoming period will have a positive effect on the inflation outlook. Effects of the additional tightening steps on pricing behavior, expectations and the inflation outlook will continue to be closely monitored. 
17.    The Committee assesses that restoring the disinflation process is a key factor for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, monetary stance will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives.
18.    Fiscal policy actions, along with other monetary and financial measures taken during the pandemic, have supported the potential output of the economy by limiting the pandemic-related economic risks and significantly contributed to the onset of a recovery in economic activity. During the stabilization of the economy the determination of the macro policy mix in a way that will ensure the continuation of the disinflation process with a strong coordination among monetary, credit and fiscal policies is crucial for maintaining healthy and stable growth by curbing macrofinancial risks. 
19.    It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance."

Press Release on Maximum Interest Rates for Credit Cards
Maximum interest rates for credit cards will be determined through a rule-based method, which is predictable and reflects current market conditons.
Maximum interest rates for credit cards will be based on the reference rate calculated according to the Communiqué on Procedures and Principles Regarding the Fees That Banks Can Charge Their Commercial Clients (No: 2020/4) in view of the banks’ weighted average deposit rates as an indicator of the funding cost. The monthly maximum contractual interest rate in Turkish lira will be determined by adding 55 basis points to this reference rate.
In this respect, the calculation method for the interest rates on credit card transactions is as follows:




Monthly Maximum Interest Rates
			on Credit Cards (%)


Turkish Lira (TL)


Foreign Exchange (FX)




Maximum Contractual Interest Rate


Reference rate + 0.55


TL maximum contractual * 80%




Maximum Overdue Interest Rate 

TL maximum contractual + 0.30
FX maximum contractual + 0.30



Accordingly, to be effective from 1 November 2020, the monthly maximum contractual interest rate on credit card transactions in Turkish lira will be 1.46%, while the monthly maximum overdue interest rate will be 1.76%, whereas the monthly maximum contractual interest rate on credit card transactions in foreign exchange will be 1.17% and the monthly maximum overdue interest rate will be 1.47%.
Rates calculated according to this method will be announced on the CBRT website on the fifth-to- the last business day of each month and will take effect on the first day of the following month.

Press Release on Interest Rates
Participating Committee Members
Naci Ağbal (Governor), Murat Çetinkaya, Ömer Duman, Uğur Namık Küçük, Oğuzhan Özbaş, Emrah Şener, Abdullah Yavaş.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to: 
-    increase the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 10.25 percent to 15 percent, and
-    provide all funding through the main policy rate, which is the one-week repo auction rate.    
Global economic activity has recovered partially in the third quarter. However, uncertainties regarding global economic activity heightened due to the recent increase in Covid-19 cases.    
The recovery in economic activity continues. Partial restrictions introduced due to the increasing number of cases heighten uncertainties on the short-run outlook of economic activity, particularly the services sector. Besides, strengthening domestic demand, due to the lagged effects of strong credit impulse during the pandemic, affects the current account balance adversely through the imports channel.
The lagged effects of depreciation in Turkish lira, increasing international food prices and deterioration in inflation expectations affect the inflation outlook adversely. While tracked data for November point to an increase in inflation due to the recent exchange rate volatility, this is assessed to be temporary with the decisive monetary policy stance. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to implement a transparent and strong monetary tightening in order to eliminate risks to the inflation outlook, contain inflation expectations and restore the disinflation process. 
In the periods ahead, all factors affecting inflation will be taken into account, and the tightness of monetary policy will be decisively sustained until a permanent fall in inflation is achieved. 
The permanent establishment of a low inflation environment will affect macroeconomic and financial stability positively through the fall in country risk premium, reversal in the dollarization trend, accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and the perpetual decline in financing costs.
The Central Bank will attain its main objective of achieving and maintaining price stability by adopting transparency, predictability and accountability principles of the inflation targeting regime. In light of these principles, the Central Bank funding will be provided through the one-week repo rate, which will be the main policy tool and the only indicator for the monetary stance.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

Press Release on Turkish Lira Liquidity Management
In order to simplify the operational framework of the monetary policy, starting from 20 November 2020, the funding currently provided by the Central Bank via traditional method repo auctions with one month maturity and late liquidity window facilities will instead be provided via quantity repo auctions with one-week maturity, which constitute the principal monetary policy tool of the Central Bank. Within the scope of liquidity management operations, to limit the volatility that may occur in the secondary market overnight interest rates and to ensure a balanced distribution of liquidity among different days of the week, for a one-week transition period, the overnight lending interest rate will be set as the policy rate of 15% from 20 November 2020 to 26 November 2020 (including these dates).
During this transition period and afterwards, banks will be able to borrow at the Central Bank overnight lending interest rate from the Central Bank Interbank Money Market within their limits applicable on 17 August 2020 and from Borsa Istanbul’s Repo and Reverse Repo Market and Committed Transactions Market. Also, in case of liquidity surplus, banks will be able to lend to the Central Bank at the Central Bank overnight borrowing interest rate without any limit. In addition, all participants will be able to utilize the overnight repo facility provided through quotation at the Central Bank overnight lending interest rate against TL denominated lease certificates issued by the Asset Leasing Company of the Turkish Treasury."

Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 19 November 2020
Inflation Developments 
1.    In October, consumer prices rose by 2.13%, while annual inflation increased by 0.14 points to 11.89%. Annual inflation increased in food and core goods groups, while it decreased in the energy group and remained flat in the services group. While the rise in food inflation stemmed from both unprocessed and processed food prices, the rise in core goods inflation was mainly driven by durable goods. Annual energy inflation decreased owing to the base effect in electricity prices. Against this background, while annual inflation in B and C indices increased, the trend of the B index remained almost flat and the trend of the C index slightly decreased. 
2.    In October, annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 1.56 points to 16.51%. Due to the rally in international food prices and exchange rate developments, annual inflation in unprocessed food group increased by 1.31 points to 18.78% and that of processed food prices increased by 1.70 points to 14.49%. Eggs, pulses and rice played a major role in the increase in unprocessed food prices. In the processed food group, prices of bread and cereals as well as other processed foods posted high monthly increases. The adverse outlook in the latter was mainly driven by fats and oils.
3.    Energy prices increased by 2.09% in October, yet annual inflation in the energy group decreased by 2.79 points to 3.88%. In this period, although electricity prices rose by 5.76%, annual inflation in the group decreased owing to the base effect. In October, international oil prices posted a limited decrease; however, depreciation of the Turkish lira led to a rise in fuel-oil prices and curbed a more favorable outlook in the energy group inflation. 
4.    In October, prices of core goods increased by 3.29% and group’s annual inflation rose by 0.41 points to 12.09%. Owing to exchange rate developments and the lagged effects of the strong credit impulse, the uptrend in the annual inflation in durable goods group continued, led by furniture, automobiles and white goods, and increased by 2.41 points to 19.79%. Meanwhile, monthly and annual inflation in the clothing and footwear remained weak also due to the sectoral demand conditions. In other core goods, although annual inflation remained relatively low at 9.40%, the effects of exchange rate developments have been observed in monthly price increases. 
5.    Services prices was up 0.71 percent in October and annual inflation in the group rose by 0.08 points to 10.92%. Annual inflation decreased in communication and transport services, while it increased in restaurants-hotels, rents and other services. Other services group prices were affected by exchange rate developments, meanwhile, maintenance and repair of personal transport equipment as well as health services continued to be the most prominent items. While price increases in communication and transport services were moderate, annual inflation in communication decreased on the back of the base effect. 
6.    In November, the rise in inflation expectations continued. The year-end inflation expectation increased by 71 basis points to 12.47%; the 12-month-ahead inflation expectation increased by 24 basis points to 10.77%, and the 24-month-ahead inflation expectation increased by 15 basis points to 9.20%. 
Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks 
7.    Global economic activity has recovered partially in the third quarter. However, uncertainties regarding global economic activity heightened due to the recent increases in Covid-19 cases. The recently elevated pandemic-related restrictions in the European countries keep downside risks to external demand and export outlook in place. Moreover, uncertainties remain regarding the possible effects of the pandemic and health measures on consumption habits and general spending behavior. In case of prolonged normalization due to delays in widespread vaccination, the recovery in the global activity may be slow and the global risk appetite may fluctuate. 
8.    Although crude oil prices are still below the pre-pandemic period levels, they have risen since the previous MPC Meeting. Besides, the upward trend in commodity prices excluding energy, specifically industrial metals and agricultural commodities, increases the upward cost pressure on consumer inflation. Developments in international prices as well as the exchange rate have an adverse effect on the trend inflation, particularly in food and core goods groups.
9.    Advanced and emerging economies maintain their expansionary monetary and fiscal stances. While long-term interest rates remain at historic lows across advanced economies, both central bank statements and market expectations suggest that the low interest rate environment is likely to continue for a long period. The effectiveness of these policies on financial markets, growth and employment will depend on the course of the pandemic and the available policy room in each country.
10.    Portfolio inflows to emerging economies have continued at an increasing scale since the previous MPC meeting due to improved risk sentiment. However, excluding China, inflows to bond markets increased at a limited extent, while those to equity markets remained relatively weak. Reinforced perceptions that policy rates will remain low in advanced economies and possible incentive packages are likely to improve portfolio flows to emerging economies in the upcoming period. 
11.    Domestic economic activity posted a marked recovery in the third quarter. According to September data, industrial production index increased by 1.7% month-on-month and by 30.3% quarter-on-quarter, exceeding its pre-pandemic levels. Considering together with the developments in turnover indices, economic activity recovered with a wide sectoral diffusion led by sectors sensitive to financing conditions and those producing goods for the domestic market. Nevertheless, the weak trend continued in goods and services sectors strongly tied to the tourism sector. 
12.    The recovery in economic activity continues. However, leading indicators and high-frequency data suggest that economic activity has been decelerating since mid-October. Recently, exports slowed down due to pandemic-driven limitations in Europe while domestic demand remained relatively strong. Meanwhile, partial restrictions introduced due to the increasing number of cases heighten uncertainties on the short-run outlook of economic activity, particularly the services sector. 
13.    Strengthening domestic demand due to the lagged effects of strong credit impulse during the pandemic, affects the current account balance adversely through the imports channel. In November, imports excluding gold remains almost flat, while imports of gold has still been strong, despite some slowdown. On the other hand, the restraining effects of pandemic-related measures introduced in Europe have started to be observed; however, since measures are not as tight as those introduced at the early stages of the pandemic and the activity in manufacturing industry continues, the favorable outlook particularly in exports of intermediary goods is maintained. The Committee underscored the importance of the course of the current account balance in terms of a lasting recovery in economic activity and financial stability.
14.    The recovery in economic activity has a positive effect on the labor market. In August, non-farm employment increased across sectors, while so far, employment losses have been partially compensated. In this period, both the labor force participation rate posted an increase on the back of economic recovery and unemployment rates receded. Leading indicators reveal that new job posts increased and employment opportunities continued to improve. 
Monetary Policy 
15.    The Committee emphasized that, within the inflation targeting framework, it will decisively use all of its policy tools in order to achieve and maintain price stability, by taking into account all factors affecting inflation and the increased risks.
16.    The lagged effects of depreciation in Turkish lira, increasing international commodity prices and deterioration in inflation expectations affect the inflation outlook adversely. While tracked data for November point to an increase in inflation due to the recent exchange rate volatility, this is assessed to be temporary with the decisive monetary policy stance. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to implement a transparent and strong monetary tightening in order to eliminate risks to the inflation outlook, contain inflation expectations and restore the disinflation process. In this context, the one-week repo auction interest rate, which is the policy rate, is increased from 10.25 percent to 15 percent. In the periods ahead, all factors affecting inflation will be taken into account, and tightness of monetary policy will be decisively sustained until a permanent fall in inflation is achieved. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives.
17.    In addition to monetary tightening, the Committee decided to adopt a simple operational framework to enhance transparency and predictability, and decided to provide all funding at the one-week repo auction rate, which is the main policy rate. In this regard, the funding currently provided by the CBRT via traditional method repo auctions with one-month maturity and late liquidity window facilities will instead be provided via one-week quantity repo auctions, which is the principal monetary policy tool as of 20 November 2020. 
18.    In line with the primary objective of price stability, the Committee assessed the need for a revision in the reserve requirement policy in order to enhance the effectiveness of monetary transmission mechanism. 
19.    Recently, positive expectations regarding monetary policy have been contributing to the decline in the country risk premium. The Committee assessed that the permanent establishment of a low inflation environment will affect macroeconomic and financial stability positively through the fall in country risk premium, reversal in the dollarization trend, accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and the perpetual decline in financing costs.
20.    In order to achieve price stability, a strong policy coordination and an integrated macro policy mix involving all stakeholders are required.
21.    It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance."

In line with its main objective of price stability, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey revised the reserve requirement regulation to improve the effectiveness of monetary transmission mechanism.
To enhance transparency, predictability and effectiveness of the monetary policy, with the Monetary Policy Committee Decision of 19 November 2020, the operational framework of the liquidity management was changed to provide all short-term funding through the policy rate, and the monetary policy was tightened through an increase in the policy rate in line with the main objective of price stability.
This time, the CBRT decided to simplify the reserve requirement regulation to increase the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism. Accordingly, it has been decided;
i. to repeal the reserve requirement practice that links the reserve requirement ratios and remuneration rates to real loan growth rates,
ii. to apply the same reserve requirement ratios and remuneration rates to all banks,
iii. accordingly, to set Turkish lira and FX reserve requirement ratios as follows:
 




Turkish Lira Reserve Requirement Ratios




Deposits and Participation Funds (Excluding deposits/participation funds obtained from banks abroad) 

 



- Demand, notice, up to (and including) 1 and 3-month

6%



- Up to (and including) 6-month maturity 

4%



- Up to 1-year maturity 

2%



- 1-year and longer maturity

1%



Borrower Funds of Investment Banks

6%



Other Liabilities (Including deposits/participation funds obtained from banks abroad)

 



- Up to 1-year maturity (including 1-year) 

6%



- Up to 3-year maturity (including 3-year)

3,5%



- Longer than 3-year maturity

1%



 




FX Reserve Requirement Ratios




Deposits and Participation Funds (Excluding deposits/participation funds obtained from banks abroad and precious metal deposit accounts)

 



- Demand, notice, up to (and including) 1 - 3 - 6 months maturities and up to 1-year maturity

19%



- 1-year and longer than 1-year maturity 

13%



Precious Metal Deposit Accounts

 



- Demand, notice, up to (and including) 1 - 3 - 6 months maturities and up to 1-year maturity

22%



- 1-year and longer than 1-year maturity 

18%



Borrower Funds of Investment Banks

19%



Other Liabilities (Including deposits/participation funds obtained from banks abroad)

 



- Up to (and including) 1-year maturity 

21%



- Up to (and including) 2-year maturity 

16%



- Up to (and including) 3-year maturity 

11%



- Up to (and including) 5-year maturity 

7%



- Longer than 5-year maturity

5%



 
iv. to apply remuneration rate of 12% to the TL-denominated required reserves of all banks ,
v. and to decrease the commission rate applied to the reserve requirements maintained against USD-denominated deposit / participation fund liabilities to 0% from 1.25%.
As a result of these changes, required reserves of the banking system is expected to increase by approximately TRY 12.3 billion and USD 5.7 billion in FX and gold, should the reserve option utilization rates remain unchanged.
On the other hand, intermediation costs will decrease as a result of the changes in remuneration and commission rates.
Changes in remuneration and commission rates will be effective from the maintenance period starting on 27 November 2020, while the changes in Turkish lira and FX reserve requirement ratios will take effect from the calculation date of 11 December 2020 with the maintenance period starting on 25 December 2020.

Press Release on Interest Rates
Participating Committee Members
Naci Ağbal (Governor), Murat Çetinkaya, Ömer Duman, Uğur Namık Küçük, Oğuzhan Özbaş, Emrah Şener, Abdullah Yavaş.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to increase the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 15 percent to 17 percent.
Global economic activity data indicate that partial recovery since the third quarter continues. However, despite the positive developments regarding the vaccine, uncertainties surrounding the global economic activity prevail due to the recent increase in Covid-19 cases.
National income data and indicators for the last quarter point to a strong course in economic activity. However, restrictions introduced due to the increasing number of cases create uncertainties on the short-run outlook of economic activity, particularly the services sector. Besides, strengthening domestic demand, due to the cumulative effects of high credit growth during the pandemic, increases the current account deficit.
Domestic demand conditions, cumulative cost effects, in particular the exchange rate effects, increasing international food and other commodity prices and deterioration in inflation expectations continue to affect the pricing behavior and inflation outlook adversely. Accordingly, the MPC, taking into account the end-2021 forecast target, has decided to implement a strong monetary tightening, in order to eliminate risks to the inflation outlook, contain inflation expectations and restore the disinflation process as soon as possible.
In the forthcoming period, tightness of monetary policy stance will be decisively sustained until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation in line with the targets and to price stability.
The permanent establishment of a low inflation environment will affect macroeconomic and financial stability positively through the fall in country risk premium, the beginning of reverse currency substitution, accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and the perpetual decline in financing costs.
In its decision-making process, the CBRT adopts a framework with a medium term perspective, based on analyzing all factors affecting inflation and the interaction between these factors. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

31 December 2020
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 24 December 2020
Inflation Developments
1.    In November, consumer prices rose by 2.3% and annual inflation increased by 2.14 points to 14.03%.  While the rise in inflation was mainly driven by the core goods and food groups, the services and energy groups displayed limited increases. The increase in food inflation was mostly led by the unprocessed food group, whereas durable goods pushed up the core goods group. Against this background, annual inflation rates and trends of B and C indices increased.
2.    Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 4.57 points to 21.08% in November. While processed food inflation increased by 1.43 points to 15.92%, unprocessed food inflation rose by 8.24 points to 27.02%. Fresh fruits and vegetables played an important role in the rise in unprocessed food inflation on the back of cumulative exchange rate effects, in addition to seasonality-driven supply-side factors. Meanwhile, in response to international agricultural commodity prices and exchange rate developments, the egg and poultry items that have a significant weight in the other unprocessed food group posted noticeable price increases. These developments also had an adverse effect on the processed food group. The rise in bread and cereals gained pace in November, whereas fats and oils that are highly sensitive to international prices and exchange rates stood out with marked price increases in the other processed food group.
3.    In November, energy prices increased by 0.84% and annual energy inflation posted a limited rise to 4.28%. While fuel prices increased by 1.37% on the back of the developments in international oil prices, the 3.44% rise in solid fuel prices was noteworthy in the housing group.
4.    Prices of core goods increased by 3.76% and annual core goods inflation rose by 3.23 points to 15.32% in November. The rise in durable goods inflation became more pronounced on the back of strong domestic demand conditions, stemming from the rapid credit expansion and cumulative exchange rate effects, and the annual inflation in durable goods increased by 6.71 points to 26.5%. Automobile prices came to the forefront with a month-on-month increase of 9.7%, while furniture, as well as electric and non-electric appliances continued to post strong price increases. Price hikes in the other core goods group gained momentum, driving the annual inflation up by 2.06 points to 11.46%. Meanwhile, annual inflation in the clothing and footwear group decreased further to 0.76% due to the weak demand conditions.
5.    Services prices went up by 0.62% and annual inflation in the group rose by 0.5 points to 11.42% in November. Annual inflation increased in restaurants-hotels, transport and other services, while it remained flat in rents and declined in communication. Exchange rate developments continued to affect the other services group, and the repair and maintenance of personal transportation vehicles, basic hospital care services and dental services stood out with high price hikes. The monthly price increase in the restaurant-hotel group strengthened in line with the developments in food prices.
6.    In December, the rise in inflation expectations continued. The year-end consumer inflation expectation posted a marked increase of 1.71 points to 14.18%. The revision to the medium-term expectations remained relatively more limited, with the 12-month-ahead inflation expectation increasing by 0.07 points to 10.84%, and the 24-month-ahead inflation expectation increasing by 0.04 points to 9.24%.
Factors Affecting Inflation and Risks
7.    Global economic activity data indicate that partial recovery since the third quarter continues. However, despite the positive developments regarding the vaccine, uncertainties surrounding the global economic activity prevail due to the recent increase in Covid-19 cases. While the pandemic-related restrictions in European countries create uncertainties over the external demand and export outlook, the upward trend in exports continues. Moreover, uncertainties remain regarding the possible effects of the pandemic and health measures on consumption habits and general spending behavior.
8.    Although crude oil prices are still below the pre-pandemic period levels, they have risen significantly since the previous MPC meeting. Besides, the ongoing upward trend in commodity prices excluding energy, specifically industrial metals and agricultural commodities, increases the upward cost pressure on consumer inflation through producer inflation. Developments in international prices as well as the exchange rate have an adverse effect on the trend inflation, particularly in food and core goods groups.
9.    Advanced and emerging economies maintain their expansionary monetary and fiscal stances. While long-term interest rates remain at historic lows across advanced economies, both central bank statements and market expectations suggest that the low interest rate environment is likely to continue for a long period. The effectiveness of these policies on financial markets, growth and employment will depend on the course of the pandemic and the available policy room in each country.
10.    Emerging economy portfolio markets continued to attract large volume of inflows since the previous MPC meeting due to improved risk sentiment. Excluding China, inflows to both bond markets and equity markets increased in December. Reinforced perceptions that policy rates will remain low in advanced economies and stimulus packages are likely to improve the positive outlook in portfolio flows to emerging economies in the upcoming period. 
11.    National income data and indicators for the last quarter point to a strong course in economic activity. In the third quarter of 2020, gross domestic product (GDP) posted a significant recovery with annual and quarterly increases of 6.7% and 15.6%, respectively, exceeding its pre-pandemic level. Domestic demand became the main driver of growth, while net exports had a considerably high negative contribution to growth. Private consumption and total investment expenditures soared in this period. While the rapid rise in the demand for durable goods on the back of a strong credit impulse became the main determinant of the recovery in private consumption, services-related expenditures remained weak due to the pandemic. 
12.    Recent indicators and high-frequency data indicate that economic activity has followed a strong course throughout the last quarter, although it started to lose momentum as of mid-October. October industrial production, turnover and retail sales volume indices increased rapidly compared to the third quarter averages. High-frequency data for the following months, capacity utilization rates and orders signaled that activity is buoyant in durable consumption goods sensitive to financing conditions, such as automobiles, white goods and furniture, as well as in construction-related intermediate goods sectors. Field interviews conducted in this period also confirmed the strong course of domestic demand conditions. On the other hand, restrictions introduced due to the increasing number of cases create uncertainties on the short-run outlook of economic activity, particularly on the services sector. The Committee assessed that the inflationary effects of the sectoral divergences that emerged due to pandemic dynamics and the macro policy mix, along with the risks they imply for the period ahead should be monitored.
13.    Strengthening domestic demand, due to the cumulative effects of high credit growth during the pandemic, increases the current account deficit. In December, imports excluding gold remain high despite a partial decline, while gold imports decelerate slightly. In spite of tighter pandemic measures in European countries, exports to this region continued to increase, thereby offsetting the slowdown due to Middle East countries and driving the increase in total exports. The Committee underscored once again the importance of the course of the current account balance in terms of a lasting recovery in economic activity and financial stability.
14.    Positive reflections of the economic recovery on the labor market have continued. In September, while non-farm employment increased across sectors, unemployment rates declined. Leading indicators suggest that the improvements in the labor market can be hampered due to the services sector on the back of pandemic-related restrictions.
Monetary Policy
15.    The Committee re-emphasized that monetary policy decisions will be taken within the framework of inflation targeting regime and with the priority of price stability. The monetary policy stance will be set taking into account the upside risks to the inflation outlook and with a focus on bringing inflation down cautiously and achieving price stability target in the medium term. 
16.    Breaking the backward-indexation behavior in administered prices and tax adjustments as well as in income policies, maintaining compatibility with inflation targets and enhancing predictability are the key components of the fight against inflation. Endorsement of inflation targets by all stakeholders and commitment to the price stability efforts with a common understanding and public accord, along with determination of macro policies in a coordinated manner in line with the projected disinflation path will strengthen the effectiveness of the monetary policy. In this context, the possible impact of the minimum wage, administered prices and tax adjustments to be determined for 2021 on the inflation outlook through aggregate demand and cost channels were assessed.
17.    Domestic demand conditions, cumulative cost effects, in particular the exchange rate effects, increasing international food and other commodity prices and deterioration in inflation expectations continue to affect the pricing behavior and inflation outlook adversely. Accordingly, the Committee, taking into account the end-2021 forecast target, has decided to implement a strong monetary tightening, in order to eliminate risks to the inflation outlook, contain inflation expectations and restore the disinflation process as soon as possible. In this context, the one-week repo auction interest rate, which is the policy rate, is increased from 15% to 17%. In the forthcoming period, tightness of monetary policy stance will be decisively sustained until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation in line with the targets and to price stability.
18.    The permanent establishment of a low inflation environment will affect macroeconomic and financial stability positively through the fall in country risk premium, the beginning of reverse currency substitution, accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and the perpetual decline in financing costs.
19.    The Committee reiterated its judgement that in order to achieve price stability, a strong policy coordination and an holistic macro policy mix involving all stakeholders are required.
20.    In its decision-making process, the CBRT adopts a framework with a medium term perspective, based on analyzing all factors affecting inflation and the interaction between these factors. 
21.    It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance."

The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 24 percent.
Recently released data show that rebalancing trend in the economy has become more noticeable. External demand maintains its strength while slowdown in economic activity continues, partly due to tight financial conditions. Current account balance is expected to maintain its improving trend.
While developments in import prices and domestic demand conditions have led to some improvement in the inflation outlook, risks on price stability continue to prevail. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement.
The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior, lagged impact of recent monetary policy decisions, contribution of fiscal policy to rebalancing process, and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.

Press Release on Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 16 January 2019
Inflation Developments
1. In December, consumer prices decreased by 0.40 percent and annual inflation fell by 1.32 points to 20.30 percent. The largest contribution to the decline in inflation came from energy and core goods groups. Oil prices and exchange rate developments favorably affected the energy group, while core goods prices were affected by both exchange rate developments and weaker domestic demand. Services inflation decreased across all subcategories. Against this background, both the annual inflation and the underlying trend in core indicators decelerated. In sum, consumer prices in December reflect the appreciation in the Turkish lira as well as demand-side effects led by weaker economic activity.
2. Annual inflation in food and nonalcoholic beverages maintains its elevated levels with 25.11 percent. As of December, annual food inflation is 27,09 percent in unprocessed food group and 23,22 percent in processed food group.
3. Energy prices were down by 3.12 percent in December and annual inflation in this group fell by 4.53 points to 20.82 percent. This is mainly attributed to the decline in fuel prices driven by the fall in international oil prices as well as the developments in the Turkish lira. Annual inflation in the energy group is projected to decrease significantly in January mostly due to the adjustments in electricity and natural gas prices as well as to the reductions in municipal water prices in some cities.
4. Annual core goods inflation dropped by 2.22 points to 24.67 percent in December. In this period, durable goods prices decreased across all subcategories, most visibly in automobiles. The deceleration in annual clothing and footwear inflation also continued in December due to demand conditions. Although monthly price increases in other core goods significantly lost pace, annual inflation in this group remained high. To sum up, the decline in core goods inflation is attributed to the appreciation in the Turkish lira and the weaker domestic demand.
5. Services inflation decreased by 0.21 points to 14.46 percent. Annual inflation remained flat in the communication group but declined in other subcategories. Cost-side factors led by food and fuel prices continued to have a favorable effect on the catering and transportation services inflation. The Committee noted that the deceleration in monthly inflation in the rents group persisted. It also reiterated that the weakening domestic demand supported the overall slowdown in services inflation.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6. Recently released data show that the rebalancing trend in the economy has become more noticeable. Industrial production decreased in the October-November period compared to the third quarter of 2018, and current indicators signal that the weak course in the sector also continued in December. Indicators for services and construction sectors also reveal that the slowdown in economic activity has spread to all sectors. As a result of the domestic demand-led sharp decline in imports coupled with robust exports of goods and strong tourism demand, net exports continued to make a large contribution to quarterly and annual growth in the final quarter of the year and partially prevented the economic activity from weakening further.
7. Slowdown in economic activity continues, partly due to tight financial conditions. Although there has been some improvement in financial indicators recently, loan demand and supply remain subdued. Leading indicators have yet to show signs of recovery in domestic demand. The extended tax cuts for durable goods are likely to spur consumer demand in the first quarter. However, the weak labor market will continue to curb aggregate demand.
8. Despite recent signs of some slowdown in global growth, external demand maintains its strength. Firms’ orientation towards external markets amid sluggish domestic demand and their flexibility in market diversification stimulate exports of goods; and the external balance continues to improve rapidly on brisk tourism demand. Thus, the current account balance is expected to maintain its improving trend in the upcoming period.
9. Labor market data confirm that the economy continues to slow down on the back of domestic demand. In the September-November period, construction employment declined further while industrial employment remained flat, and services employment picked up slightly. Business activities with relatively stronger external trade links and the public sector continued to make a positive contribution to employment.
Monetary Policy and Risks
10. Increased protectionist trends in international trade continue to keep the risks to the global growth outlook alive by increasing uncertainties regarding global economic policies. The global economic slowdown has been slightly more pronounced since the previous MPC meeting. Therefore, the outlook for 2019 has been revised down for both advanced and emerging economies.
11. The buoyant labor markets across advanced economies sustain the wages-backed upside risks to global inflation. Nevertheless, given the weaker global growth otlook and the fall in oil prices, the global inflation pressures are judged to be mild in the upcoming period. Still, the Committee will continue to closely monitor the risks to global inflation arising from the high volatility of energy prices and the wage inflation.
12. Expectations on the normalization of monetary policy stances in advanced economies have moderated since the last MPC meeting. However, global financial risks and the uncertainty over global economic policies are rather elevated for the coming months, upholding the downside risks to portfolio flows to emerging economies.
13. While developments in import prices and domestic demand conditions have led to some improvement in the inflation outlook, risks to price stability prevail. Elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations, and uncertainties over the course of cost factors continue to pose risks to the pricing behavior in the coming period. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance until the inflation outlook displays a significant improvement and kept the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 24 percent.
14. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior, lagged impact of recent monetary policy decisions, contribution of fiscal policy to rebalancing process, and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.
15. The fiscal policy outlook that the monetary policy is based on incorporates a policy stance that focuses on price stability and macroeconomic rebalancing and that is coordinated with the monetary policy. Accordingly, the monetary policy stance assumes that administered price and tax adjustments are formulated in a way that will help reducing the backward indexation behavior. If the fiscal policy significantly deviates from this framework leading to an adverse impact on the medium-term inflation outlook, the monetary policy stance may be revised.
16. Collective efforts to turn the recently enhanced coordination between monetary and fiscal policies into a sustained and systematic structure are expected to support the achievement of price stability. Moreover, continued structural steps focusing on reducing rigidity and volatility in inflation will contribute to price stability and therefore social welfare."

Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting 
Meeting Date: 6 March 2019
Inflation Developments
1. In February, consumer prices increased by 0.16% and annual inflation fell by 0.68 points to 19.67%. Annual inflation receded in subgroups other than energy. This rise in energy inflation was driven by oil prices, while the core goods inflation was affected by the mild course of the exchange rate as well as the subdued domestic demand. Services inflation offered a limited contribution to disinflation, yet remained high. Against this background, core inflation indicators recorded a slowed annual inflation. Meanwhile, the underlying trend of core indicators rose slightly, yet remained low. In sum, the recent moderation in the Turkish lira as well as the weak domestic demand support the fall in consumer inflation, whereas cumulative cost pressures put a limit on better prospects.
2. Annual inflation in food and nonalcoholic beverages declined by 1.72 points in February to 29.95%, contributed both by the processed and unprocessed food groups. Annual inflation in these groups stood at 20.18% and 39.07%, respectively. The fall in the unprocessed food group was led by fresh fruits and vegetables, while the annual inflation in this group remained high with 59.75%.
3. Energy prices were up by 0.75% in February and annual energy inflation rose by 1.51 points to 14.57%. This is mainly attributed to the rising fuel and bottled gas prices in tandem with the outlook for international energy prices. 
4. Annual core goods inflation fell by 1.53 points to 21.22% in February. In this period, annual inflation lost further pace across all subcategories. Prices of durable goods maintained the downtrend, while the clothing and footwear group witnessed a slower decline in annual inflation led by the weak domestic demand. Monthly price increases remained subdued also in other core goods. To sum up, the recent modest course of core goods inflation is attributed to the course of the Turkish lira and the slow progress of domestic demand.
5. Following an upsurge in January, services inflation posted a relatively mild increase in February by 0.58%. Thus, annual services inflation declined by 0.26 points to 15.14%. Annual inflation remained flat in rents, but decreased in other subgroups. Annual price increases in the restaurants-hotel group recorded an increase in tandem with the food inflation. Led also by demand conditions, annual inflation in transportation services posted a decline due chiefly to highway and airway transport fees. Despite the slow course of domestic demand, services inflation remained elevated due to the cost factors as well as the backward-indexation behavior.
Factors Affecting Inflation 
6. Recently released data show that the rebalancing trend in the economy has become more noticeable. Industrial production posted a quarter-on-quarter fall in the fourth quarter of 2018, and the economic slowdown has spread across all sectors as suggested by indicators for services and construction. It has been assessed that, despite the slowdown in domestic demand and imports, net exports, coupled with robust exports of goods and tourism demand have continued to boost quarterly and annual growth in the last quarter.
7. Economic activity displays a slow pace, partly due to tight financial conditions. Increasing public expenditure, extended tax cuts for durable goods and the partial rebound in loan growth appear to have spurred domestic demand in the first quarter. 
8. Despite recent signs of a global economic slowdown, particularly for the EU, external demand maintains its relative strength. Firms’ orientation towards external markets amid sluggish domestic demand and their flexibility in market diversification stimulate exports of goods; lagged exchange rate effects, loans and economic slowdown dampen import demand, and the external balance continues to improve rapidly on brisk tourism demand. Thus, the current account balance is expected to maintain its improving trend in the upcoming period.
9. Labor market data confirm that the economy continues to slow. In the October-December period, nonfarm employment was down quarter-on-quarter across all sectors, construction in particular; while unemployment remained on the rise. 
Monetary Policy and Risks
10. The global economy continued to lose momentum since the previous MPC meeting, with the EU posting a more noticeable downturn. Therefore, global growth forecasts for 2019 have been revised down. Protectionist trends in international trade keep the downside risks to the global growth outlook alive by increasing uncertainties regarding global economic policies.
11. The buoyant labor markets across advanced economies sustain the wages-backed upside risks to global inflation. Nevertheless, given the weaker global growth outlook and the course of energy prices, global inflation pressures are expected to be mild in the upcoming period. 
12. As the deceleration in global growth became more pronounced, the outlook regarding the monetary policy stance of advanced economies further eased compared to the previous MPC meeting period. This outlook implies more favorable conditions in terms of portfolio flows to emerging economies, however elevated levels of uncertainty over global economic policies and global financial risks keep the downside risks to portfolio flows alive. 
13. While developments in import prices and domestic demand conditions have led to some improvement in inflation indicators, risks to price stability continue to prevail. Elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations, and uncertainties over the course of cost factors and pricing behavior continue to pose risks to the inflation outlook in the coming period. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance until the inflation outlook displays a significant improvement and kept the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 24%.
14. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior, lagged impact of recent monetary policy decisions, contribution of fiscal policy to the rebalancing process, and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.
15. The fiscal policy outlook that the monetary policy is based on incorporates a policy stance that focuses on price stability and macroeconomic rebalancing and that is coordinated with the monetary policy. Accordingly, the monetary policy stance assumes that administered price and tax adjustments are formulated in a way that will help reducing the backward indexation behavior. If the fiscal policy significantly deviates from this framework leading to an adverse impact on the medium-term inflation outlook, the monetary policy stance may be revised.
16. Collective efforts to turn the recently enhanced coordination between monetary and fiscal policies into a sustained and systematic structure are expected to support the achievement of price stability. Moreover, continued structural steps focusing on reducing rigidity and volatility in inflation will contribute to price stability and therefore social welfare."

Press Release on Market Developments
The macro indicators pertaining to the Turkish economy point that the rebalancing process continues thanks to the coordinated policy actions. The leading indicators suggest that there has been a moderate recovery in domestic demand in the first quarter. Underpinned by the strong trend in the exports of goods and tourism demand, net exports continue to contribute to growth.
In this regard, improvement in current account balance is expected to continue with further acceleration. In the economic rebalancing process, the monetary policy focuses on the price stability objective while the strong coordination with fiscal policy supports disinflation. Meanwhile, the Central Bank is decisive about its policy towards reinforcing its reserves. Accordingly, an uptrend was observed in the reserves following the financial market volatility observed last year. The recent fluctuations in gross reserves are driven by ordinary transactions and periodic factors, and there are no unforeseen incidences.
The Central Bank will closely monitor fluctuations and unhealthy price formations in financial markets and will use all monetary policy and liquidity management instruments to maintain price stability and support financial stability, if deemed necessary.

Press Release On the Maximum Interest Rates for Credit Cards in Q2 2019
The monthly maximum contractual interest rate for the credit card borrowings has been revised as 2.15 percent for the Turkish lira and 1.72 percent for foreign exchange transactions, whereas the monthly maximum overdue interest rate will be 2.65 percent for the Turkish lira and 2.22 percent for foreign exchange transactions, to be effective from 1 April 2019.
Banks in Turkey, as is the case in other countries, charge higher interest rates for credit card borrowing than they do for consumer loans. The CBRT, therefore, advises credit card holders with short-term credit needs to seek a consumer loan rather than borrowing on personal credit cards.

30 April 2019
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 25 April 2019
Inflation Developments 
1. In March, consumer prices were up by 1.03% and annual inflation rose by 0.04 points to 19.71%. In this period, annual inflation increased in food and energy groups while it decreased in the core goods group. The rise in annual food inflation was driven by the significant hike in prices of fresh fruits and vegetables. Energy prices rose mainly due to international oil prices and exchange rate developments. While services inflation followed an almost flat course, the slowdown in core goods inflation continued across all subgroups. Against this background, core inflation indicators suggested a continued deceleration in annual inflation, and the underlying trend of core indicators remained low. 
2. Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 0.52 points in March to 29.77%. Unprocessed food prices, led by fresh fruit and vegetable prices, had a decisive role in this development. The processed food group posted moderate price increases while annual inflation in this group declined.  
3. Energy prices were up by 1.94% and annual energy inflation rose by 1.84 points to 16.41%. This rise is mainly attributed to the rising fuel and bottled gas prices in tandem with exchange rates and the outlook for international oil prices. 
4. In March, annual core goods inflation dropped by 1.30 points to 19.92%. In this period, annual inflation decreased across all subgroups. The decline in durable goods prices was mainly driven by the fall in automobile prices while the new season price hikes in the clothing group remained below those of the previous year. Annual inflation in other core goods lost pace but still remained high. To sum up, the moderate course of core goods inflation is attributed to weak domestic demand.
5. Services inflation rose month-on-month by 0.07 points to 15.21%. Annual inflation slightly decreased in restaurants-hotels, rents, and transportation services whereas it increased in the other services subgroup. The decline in annual inflation in transportations services was led by local passenger transportation. Meanwhile, the increase in prices of maintenance-repair services as well as in prices of education services driven by private school fees constituted the most significant factor affecting other services inflation. Despite the slow course of domestic demand, services inflation remained elevated due to the cost factors as well as the backward-indexation behavior. 
Factors Affecting Inflation
6. In the final quarter of 2018, GDP decreased by 3.0% on an annual basis and by 2.4% on a quarterly basis. Thus, growth in 2018 was 2.6%. While the contraction in economic activity in the final quarter of 2018 was driven by domestic demand conditions, net exports continued to underpin growth and the rebalancing trend in the Turkish economy became more apparent.
7. Recently released data show that the rebalancing trend in the economy continues. Economic activity displays a slow pace due to tight financial conditions.  The rise in public expenditures, extended tax cuts on durable goods and the partial rebound in loan volume underpinned a moderate recovery in domestic demand in the first quarter. Accordingly, while a partial recovery is observed in economic activity compared to the previous quarter, the contribution of aggregate demand conditions to disinflation continues. The recent rise in financial volatility and risk premium indicators increases the downside risks to the domestic demand outlook.
8. Despite recent signs of a global slowdown, particularly for the EU, external demand remains relatively strong. Firms’ orientation towards external markets amid sluggish domestic demand and their flexibility in market diversification stimulate exports of goods; lagged exchange rate effects, subdued loans and economic activity dampen import demand; and external balance continues to improve rapidly on brisk tourism demand. Thus, the current account balance is expected to maintain its improving trend in the upcoming period. 
9. Labor market data confirm the slowdown in economic activity. The data for January 2019 suggest that nonfarm employment was down across all sectors compared to the previous period, construction in particular; while unemployment remained on the rise.  
Monetary Policy and Risks
10. Economic activity has lost further momentum across the world, particularly in the EU, since the previous MPC meeting. The ongoing political uncertainty surrounding the EU, the current trade conflict between the US and China and geopolitical tensions have led to higher uncertainty over global economic policies and persistently fragile financial markets, which feeds into the downside risks to global economic activity.
11. Supply-side effects may pose upside risks to prices for international crude oil and other commodities in the upcoming period. If such risks materialize, the monetary policy response will ensure to keep the possible deterioration in inflation expectations and the pricing behavior under control.
12. The improvement in the risk appetite due to the postponed normalization of monetary policy across advanced economies has provided a partial boost for portfolio flows to emerging economies.
13. Developments in domestic demand conditions have led to some improvement in inflation indicators. However, higher food and import prices and the elevated course of inflation expectations point to continued risks to price stability. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance until the inflation outlook displays a significant improvement, and kept the one-week repo auction rate, i.e. the policy rate, unchanged at 24%.
14. The Committee, at its meeting, evaluated the medium-term projections that are envisaged to be included in the April Inflation Report. Projections are based on an outlook in which the country risk premium that has increased in recent weeks due to geopolitical factors and uncertainties would recover in response to a partial normalization of those factors as well as to a tight monetary policy stance and the inflation-focused macro-policy mix. In the event that the recovery of the risk premium and financial volatility indicators are delayed, inflation and exchange rate expectations may hamper the disinflation process.   
15. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and monetary stance will be determined to keep inflation in line with the targeted path.
16. The fiscal policy outlook that the monetary policy is based on incorporates a policy stance that focuses on price stability and macroeconomic rebalancing and that is coordinated with the monetary policy. Accordingly, the monetary policy stance assumes that administered price and tax adjustments are formulated in a way that will help reducing the backward indexation behavior. If the fiscal policy significantly deviates from this framework leading to an adverse impact on the medium-term inflation outlook, the monetary policy stance may be revised.
17. Collective efforts to turn the recently enhanced coordination between monetary and fiscal policies into a sustained and systematic structure are expected to support the achievement of price stability. Moreover, continued structural steps focusing on reducing rigidity and volatility in inflation will contribute to price stability and therefore social welfare."

Press Release on Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 12 June 2019
Inflation Developments 
1. In May, consumer prices were up by 0.95% and inflation decreased by 0.79 points to 18.71%. In this period, annual inflation remained flat in the services group while it decreased in food, energy and core goods groups. Annual food inflation declined, led by fresh fruit and vegetable prices. While energy group inflation posted a mild monthly increase, it recorded an annual decline due to the base effect. The slowdown in core goods inflation continued across subgroups. Despite the ongoing deceleration in annual inflation of core inflation indicators, the underlying trend recorded a moderate increase. 
2. In the food and non-alcoholic beverages group, annual unprocessed food inflation declined to 35.33% from 45.69% due to fresh fruit and vegetable prices. Processed food prices, on the other hand, posted a significant month-on-month increase in response to the effect of cumulative cost increases on prices.  
3. In May, while energy prices increased by 0.25%, the decline in the municipal water tariff contained a further rise in prices. The effect of the recent depreciation in the Turkish lira on fuel prices remained limited due to the implementation of the sliding scale tariff.
4. In May, annual core goods inflation decreased by 0.86 points to 16.59%, underpinned by declines across all subgroups. The clothing group price hikes, which had remained below seasonal averages in April, displayed a slightly similar trend in May. Despite the inflationary impacts of the recent increase in exchange rates, the weak course of domestic demand is assessed to contribute to the deceleration in core goods inflation.  
5. Annual services inflation remained flat at 15.15% in May while the underlying trend of services inflation increased. The downward impact of the weak domestic demand on services inflation is believed to be restrained by the backward indexation behavior and elevated levels of inflation expectations as well as the accumulated cost increase in some items. 
Factors Affecting Inflation
6. In the first quarter of 2019, the gross domestic product dropped by 2.6% in annual terms whereas it increased by 1.3% in quarterly terms. The recovery in the first quarter was driven by domestic demand, led by the accommodative stance of the public sector. Net exports did not contribute to quarterly growth but their strong contribution to annual growth continued.
7. Recently released data show that the rebalancing trend in the economy has continued. Economic activity displays a slow pace due to tight financial conditions. A weaker public expenditure support and slower loan growth than in the first quarter as well as rising financial volatility and risk premiums all weigh on domestic demand. Accordingly, developments in domestic demand conditions support disinflation.
8. Despite recent signs of a global slowdown, particularly for the EU, external demand maintains its relative strength. Firms’ orientation towards external markets amid sluggish domestic demand and their flexibility in market diversification stimulate exports of goods; lagged exchange rate effects, subdued loans and economic activity dampen import demand; and external balance continues to improve rapidly on brisk tourism demand. Thus, net exports are likely to provide a strong boost to annual growth and the current account balance is expected to maintain its improving trend.
9. Labor market data confirm the slowdown in economic activity. The data for February 2019 suggest that services employment was up from the previous period whereas industrial and construction employment remained on the decline and unemployment continued to rise.
Monetary Policy and Risks
10. Global economic activity has lost further momentum due to more pronounced slowdown in the growth rates of both advanced and emerging economies. The trade tension between the US and China, the more-than-expected deceleration in growth rates of advanced economies and fluctuations in financial markets of some emerging economies have led to higher uncertainty in global economic policies, which feed into the downside risks to global economic activity.
11. Supported also by the flat course of crude oil prices in a vast part of the April-May period, global inflation rates remained mild. Although crude oil prices receded to a great extent amid global trade tensions and concerns over growth following the third week of May, it is considered that crude oil prices are likely to exhibit high fluctuation in the period ahead due to demand prospects and geopolitical risks.
12. Monetary policy outlook in advanced economies has eased since the previous MPC meeting. However, the high uncertainty over global economic outlook and high volatility in financial markets may lead to a more volatile course in portfolio inflows to emerging economies. In addition, ongoing geopolitical problems and country-specific fragilities are considered to be influential in portfolio flows to emerging economies.
13. Developments in domestic demand conditions and the tight monetary policy support disinflation. In order to contain the risks to the pricing behavior and to reinforce the disinflation process, the Committee has decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance and keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 24%.
14. The Committee keeps its evaluation that, if uncertainties stemming from geopolitical factors are eased, in response to the tight monetary policy stance and the inflation-focused macro-policy mix, the country risk premium would continue to decline, which would support the recovery of the economy.
15. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, monetary stance will be determined to keep inflation in line with the targeted path. 
16. The fiscal policy outlook that the monetary policy is based on incorporates a policy stance that focuses on price stability and macroeconomic rebalancing and that is coordinated with the monetary policy. Accordingly, the monetary policy stance assumes that administered price and tax adjustments are formulated in a way that will help reducing the backward indexation behavior. If the fiscal policy significantly deviates from this framework leading to an adverse impact on the medium-term inflation outlook, the monetary policy stance may be revised.

Decision of the Monetary Policy Committee
Participating Committee Members
Murat Uysal (Governor), Ömer Duman, Uğur Namık Küçük, Emrah Şener, Abdullah Yavaş.
 
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 24 percent to 19.75 percent.
Recently released data indicate a moderate recovery in the economic activity. Goods and services exports continue to display an upward trend despite the weakening in the global economic outlook, indicating improved competitiveness. In particular, strong tourism revenues support the economic activity through direct and indirect channels. Looking forward, net exports are expected to contribute to the economic growth and the gradual recovery is likely to continue with the help of the disinflation trend and the partial improvement in financial conditions. The composition of growth is having a positive impact on the external balance. Current account balance is expected to maintain its improving trend.
Recently, weaker global economic activity and heightened downside risks to inflation have strengthened the possibility that advanced economy central banks will take expansionary monetary policy steps. While these developments support the demand for emerging market assets and the risk appetite, rising protectionism and uncertainty regarding global economic policies are closely monitored in terms of their impact on both capital flows and international trade.
Inflation outlook continued to improve. In the second quarter, inflation displayed a significant fall with the contribution from a deceleration in unprocessed food and energy prices. Domestic demand conditions and the tight monetary policy continue to support disinflation. Underlying trend indicators, supply side factors, and import prices lead to an improvement in the inflation outlook. In light of these developments, recent forecast revisions suggest that inflation is likely to materialize slightly below the projections of the April Inflation Report by the end of the year. Accordingly, considering all the factors affecting inflation outlook, the Committee decided to reduce the policy rate by 425 basis points.
The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is the key for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery.  Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, the extent of the monetary tightness will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

2019,31 July 2019,Press Release on Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting,"No: 2019-31
31 July 2019
Press Release on Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 25 July 2019
Inflation Developments 
1. In June, consumer prices remained almost unchanged with a minimal rise of 0.03% and annual inflation decreased by 2.99 points to 15.72%. In this period, annual inflation decreased across all subgroups, chiefly in the food group. Annual food inflation declined on the back of the falling unprocessed food prices in tandem with the prospects for the vegetable products. Energy prices decreased, contributing positively to consumer inflation. Domestic demand developments and the effects of monetary tightening as well as the waning impacts of the cumulative depreciation supported the deceleration in annual inflation of core inflation indicators.
2. In the food and non-alcoholic beverages group, annual inflation fell by 9.24 points to 19.20% in June. Annual unprocessed food inflation declined to 15.31% due to vegetable prices and became the main driver of the slowdown in consumer inflation. Processed food prices, on the other hand, posted a significant month-on-month increase also in June in response to the lagged effects of increases in costs on prices and annual inflation increased in this group.
3. In June, energy prices decreased by 1.04% due to the fall in municipal water tariffs and exchange rate developments, as well as fuel prices which declined amid falling oil prices. In July, annual energy inflation is expected to rise depending on the adjustment in electricity prices.
4. In June, annual core goods inflation decreased by 1.80 points to 14.79%, underpinned by declines across all subgroups. Despite the increase in automobile prices, the durable goods group registered a moderate price increase due to the effects of remaining subgroups, while the change in clothing prices continued to remain below seasonal averages. The high base effect from the previous year coupled with the recent exchange rate developments and the sluggish domestic demand support the fall in core goods inflation. On the other hand, annual core goods inflation is expected to rise temporarily in July due to the expiry of the provisional tax cuts in the furniture, white goods and automobile sectors.
 
5. Prices of services rose by 1.65% in June and the group’s annual inflation inched down by 0.23 points to 14.92%. Annual inflation receded in the communication and other services groups, but increased in other subgroups. In this period, the restaurants-hotels group saw price hikes both in catering and accommodation services on account of the vibrant tourism sector. The uptick in the transport group inflation was led by intercity passenger transport prices. Meanwhile, the underlying trend of services inflation displayed some increase on account of the robust tourism demand. In this period, the downward impact of the weak domestic demand on services inflation is believed to be restrained by the brisk tourism demand, cumulative cost increase in some items, real unit labor costs and the backward indexation behavior.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6. Recently-released data indicate a moderate recovery in the economic activity. Industrial production recorded a month-on-month increase in May, and maintained the trend of recovery in the April-May period with an uptick by 1.7%. This outlook is preserved even when other transport vehicles that stimulate industrial production are excluded. The unfavorable outlook in the survey data of April-May was replaced by recovery in June. Thus, survey indicators such as the manufacturing industry capacity utilization ratio and the PMI-production recorded an increase in the second quarter. On the other hand, the services sector also exhibits improvements, while the construction sector still remains sluggish.
7. Goods and services exports continue to display an upward trend despite the weakening in the global economic outlook, due to improved competitiveness. In particular, strong tourism sector supports economic activity through direct and indirect channels. Despite recent signs of a partial global slowdown, particularly for the European Union (EU), external demand maintains its relative strength. Notwithstanding the somewhat slowing exports to the EU in April-May, the seasonally-adjusted non-gold export quantity index continued to rise quarter-on-quarter amid strong exports to other regions. In the same period, the number of foreign visitors and travel and transport revenues remained on a firm uptrend while exports of services continued to boost growth. Economy-wide spillovers from the robust tourism industry through sectors such as nondurable goods production, clothing in particular, and transport services help offset part of the weak domestic demand caused by the dim labor and credit markets outlook.
8. The composition of growth is having a positive impact on the external balance. Firms’ orientation towards external markets due to subdued domestic demand, and their flexibility in market diversification stimulate exports of goods; the lagged effects of exchange rates and the modest outlook for loans and economic activity restrain import demand, and external balance continues to improve at an accelerated pace thanks to the upbeat in tourism activity. Thus, the current account balance is expected to maintain its improving trend.
9. Labor market data is relatively weak. According to April 2019 data, nonfarm employment remains flat while nonfarm unemployment rate came to a halt. Across sectors, industrial employment increased while services employment edged down and construction lost more jobs, compared to the previous period.
10. In sum, looking forward, net exports are expected to contribute to economic growth and the gradual recovery is likely to continue with the help of the disinflation trend and the partial improvement in financial conditions. Against this background, aggregate demand conditions are estimated to make a further contribution to disinflation.
Monetary Policy and Risks
11. Besides geopolitical developments, ongoing uncertainties over global economic activity pose a downside risk to growth via capital flows and foreign trade channels. The persistent trade tension between the US and China, political uncertainties regarding the Brexit, and Middle East-based geopolitical developments cause the uncertainty over global economic policies to remain elevated and the vulnerabilities in global financial markets to continue. All these factors keep the downside risks to global economic activity alive.
12. The downside risks to future crude oil prices have intensified. Despite OPEC’s decision in July to extend the production cuts, ongoing geopolitical problems across the world, and the slowing US shale oil production, the downside risks to crude oil prices have strengthened due to the high level of uncertainty over global trade and the unfavorable global economic outlook. In addition, in spite of higher wages due to tight job markets in advanced economies, inflation remains moderate. All in all, the global economic outlook appears to have fed into the downside risks to global inflation.
13. Recently, weaker global economic activity and heightened downside risks to inflation have strengthened the possibility of advanced economy central banks to take expansionary monetary policy steps. These developments support the demand for emerging market assets and the risk appetite, increasing the upward risks on portfolio flows to emerging markets. On the other hand, rising protectionism and the uncertainty regarding global economic policies pose downside risks to these portfolio flows. These factors are closely monitored in terms of their potential impacts on domestic economic activity and financial markets through both capital flows and international trade.
14. In the second quarter of the year, Turkey’s risk premium negatively diverged from other emerging market economies due to domestic uncertainties and geopolitical factors. However, it has rapidly declined since mid-June owing to reduced uncertainties, the improvement in the outlook for global financial conditions as well as in macroeconomic indicators, and the tight monetary policy stance, while the volatility in financial markets has decreased. On the other hand, the persistence of high levels of country risk premium and exchange rate volatility as well as the lingering global uncertainties and geopolitical risks keep the upside risks to the medium-term inflation outlook alive.
15. In the second quarter of 2019, banks’ domestic funding conditions tightened, causing them to reflect the increased Turkish lira funding costs in loan rates. Due to these developments and the expectations for the overall economic outlook, loan growth rates lost pace in this period. A decrease in the degree of monetary policy tightness and the introduction of accommodative credit packages are deemed to be the factors that will support the normalization in credit conditions and credit demand in the upcoming period. The speed, scope and sustainability of the normalization in credit conditions will be important for the economic activity outlook.
16. Despite the restrictive impact of domestic demand conditions on inflation, elevated levels of inflation continue to pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook in the upcoming period. Anchoring inflation and exchange rate expectations is crucial for the effectiveness of monetary policy in the current period.
17. The course of food prices constitutes one of the risk factors that may affect the short-term inflation outlook. While accumulated cost pressures keep the upside risks to processed food prices alive, they may also exert an additional pressure on catering services prices through periodic factors. On the other hand, projections for unprocessed food inflation may be revised downwards depending on the future course of the correction in this group’s inflation driven by the increased supply of vegetables due to favorable weather conditions. Against this background, the risks that the course of food prices may pose to the short-term inflation outlook are considered to be balanced.
18. The inflation outlook continued to improve. In the second quarter, inflation displayed a significant fall with the contribution from a deceleration in unprocessed food and energy prices. Domestic demand conditions and the tight monetary policy continue to support disinflation. Underlying trend indicators, supply side factors, and import prices lead to an improvement in the inflation outlook. In light of these developments, recent end-year inflation forecasts are slightly below the projections of the April Inflation Report. Accordingly, considering all the factors affecting the inflation outlook, the Committee decided to reduce the policy rate by 425 basis points.
19. The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is the key for achieving lower country risk premium, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery.  Keeping the disinflation process on track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, the extent of the monetary tightness will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives.
20. The Committee maintains its assessment that the recent gradual improvement in the country risk premium will also continue in the upcoming period. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of price and financial stability objectives, taking into account all macroeconomic indicators including inflation and economic activity in particular. In order to support the effectiveness of monetary policy and minimize a likely inflation-growth trade-off, it will be crucial that macro-financial policies are determined with a focus on reducing financial volatility and risk premium, and that the predictability of fiscal policy continues to be reinforced.
21. The fiscal policy outlook that the monetary policy is based on incorporates a policy stance that focuses on price stability and macroeconomic rebalancing and that is coordinated with the monetary policy. Accordingly, the monetary policy stance assumes that administered price and tax adjustments are formulated in a way that will help reduce the backward indexation behavior. If the fiscal policy significantly deviates from this framework leading to an adverse impact on the medium-term inflation outlook, the monetary policy stance may be revised.
22. Collective efforts to turn the recently enhanced coordination between monetary and fiscal policies into a sustained and systematic structure are expected to support the achievement of price stability. Moreover, continued structural steps focusing on reducing rigidity and volatility in inflation will contribute to price stability and therefore social welfare."

Press Release on Reserve Requirements
With the intention of using reserve requirements more flexibly and effectively as a macroprudential tool to support financial stability, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) has decided to change the ratio of and the remuneration applied to required reserves. Accordingly, the reserve requirement ratios for Turkish lira liabilities and the remuneration rates for Turkish lira-denominated required reserves are linked to the annual growth rates of the total of banks’ Turkish lira-denominated standardized cash loans and cash loans under close monitoring, excluding foreign currency-indexed loans and loans extended to banks.
For banks whose loan growth is between 10% and 20% (reference values), the reserve requirement ratios for Turkish lira liabilities in all maturity brackets excluding deposits and participation funds with 1-year or longer maturity (excluding deposits/participation funds obtained from banks abroad) and other liabilities with longer than 3-year maturity (including deposits/participation funds obtained from banks abroad), will be set at 2%. The reserve requirement ratios for other banks are left unchanged.
Additionally, the current remuneration rate of 13% applied to Turkish lira-denominated required reserves, is set at 15% for banks with a loan growth between the reference values and at 5% to others.
According to the new arrangement, loan growth rates will be calculated in each reserve requirement period and the banks whose loan growth is between the reference values will be subject to the related reserve requirement ratios and remuneration rates in the next three-months (six reserve requirement periods).

Decision of the Monetary Policy Committee
Participating Committee Members
Murat Uysal (Governor), Murat Çetinkaya, Ömer Duman, Uğur Namık Küçük, Oğuzhan Özbaş, Emrah Şener, Abdullah Yavaş.
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 19.75 percent to 16.50 percent.
Recently released data indicate that moderate recovery in economic activity continues. In the first half of the year, the contribution of net exports to economic growth continued, while investment demand remained weak and the contribution of private consumption gradually increased. Goods and services exports continue to display an upward trend despite the weakening in the global economic outlook, indicating improved competitiveness. In particular, strong tourism revenues support the economic activity through direct and indirect channels. Leading indicators point to a partial improvement in the sectoral diffusion of economic activity. Looking forward, net exports are expected to contribute to economic growth and the gradual recovery is likely to continue with the help of the disinflation trend and the improvement in financial conditions. The composition of growth is having a positive impact on the external balance. Current account balance is expected to maintain its improving trend.
Recently, advanced economy central banks have started to adopt more expansionary policies as global economic activity weakened and downside risks to inflation heightened. While these developments support the demand for emerging market assets and the risk appetite, rising protectionism and uncertainty regarding global economic policies are closely monitored in terms of their impact on both capital flows and international trade.  
Inflation outlook continued to improve. In addition to the stable course of the Turkish lira, improvement in inflation expectations and mild domestic demand conditions supported the disinflation in core indicators. In August, consumer inflation displayed a significant fall with the contribution of core goods, energy and food groups. Domestic demand conditions and the level of monetary tightness continue to support disinflation. Underlying trend indicators, supply side factors, and import prices lead to an improvement in the inflation outlook. In light of these developments, recent forecast revisions suggest that inflation is likely to materialize slightly below the projections of the July Inflation Report by the end of the year. Accordingly, considering all the factors affecting inflation outlook, the Committee decided to reduce the policy rate by 325 basis points. At this point, the current monetary policy stance, to a large part, is considered to be consistent with the projected disinflation path.

2019,19 September 2019,Press Release on Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting,"No: 2019-37
19 September 2019
Press Release on Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 12 September 2019
Inflation Developments 
1. In August, consumer prices rose by 0.86%, while annual inflation decreased by 1.64 points to 15.01%. The fall in inflation was mainly driven by the core goods and energy groups, while the downtrend in annual food inflation continued. In addition to the stable course of the Turkish lira, improved inflation expectations, commodity prices, and domestic demand conditions supported the decline in the annual inflation of core indicators. Against this background, core indicators maintained their mild course. Inflation will register a significant fall in September due also to the high base from the previous year.
2. In the food and non-alcoholic beverages group, annual inflation fell by 0.99 points to 17.22% in August. In this period, annual inflation lost pace both in unprocessed and processed food groups. Monthly increases in processed food prices, which has surged since May due to the lagged cost effects, lost pace in August. Leading indicators show that the slowdown in annual food inflation continues in September.
3. In August, energy prices rose by 0.34%. In this period, the mild course of the Turkish lira and the decline in oil prices pulled fuel prices down, curbing the effect of the rise in natural gas prices. Despite the upside impact of the adjustments in natural gas prices in September, annual energy inflation is projected to decline further due to the base effect. Prices of tobacco products soared by 20.84%, adding 0.99 points to the group’s contribution to annual inflation.
4. In August, annual core goods inflation decreased by 4.79 points to 13.02%, mainly due to durables and other core goods, while annual inflation in the clothing group posted a limited rise. Despite price increases in white goods, prices of durable goods registered a decline due to falling automobile prices. Prices of other core goods have recorded a month-on-month decline, albeit limited, for the first time since June 2010. The high base effect from the previous year accompanied by the recent exchange rate developments and the mild course of economic activity supports the fall in core goods inflation.
5. Services prices rose by 1.12% in August while annual services inflation inched down by 0.38 points to 14.19%. Annual inflation declined in restaurants-hotels and communication groups whereas it remained flat in rents and transport groups and increased in the other services group. The catering services-driven slowdown in the restaurants-hotels group is also attributed to the moderate course of food prices. The other services group posted a large monthly increase that was mainly triggered by the rise in private university tuition fees. Against this background, the underlying trend of services inflation displayed a modest deceleration. In this period, the downward impact of domestic demand conditions on services inflation is believed to have been restrained by cumulative cost increases in some items, real unit labor costs and the backward indexation behavior. It is projected that there will be price increases in transport services in September due to urban transport fares.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6. Recently released data indicate that moderate recovery in economic activity continues. In July, industrial production increased month-on-month by 4.3% in seasonally and calendar-adjusted terms, showing that the decline observed in June due to the impact of the extended religious holiday was a temporary one. This outlook is preserved even when the other transport vehicles sector, which has recently stimulated industrial production, is excluded. Leading indicators point to a continued moderate recovery trend in the third quarter and to a partial improvement in the sectoral diffusion of economic activity.
7. Goods and services exports continue to display an upward trend despite the weakening in the global economic outlook, indicating improved competitiveness. In particular, strong tourism revenues support the economic activity through direct and indirect channels. Despite recent signs of a partial global slowdown, particularly for the European Union (EU), external demand maintains its relative strength. Notwithstanding the somewhat slowing exports to the EU, the seasonally-adjusted non-gold export quantity index continued to rise amid strong exports to other regions. In the same period, the number of foreign visitors and travel and transport revenues remained on a firm uptrend while exports of services continued to boost growth. Economy-wide spillovers from the robust course of tourism to sectors such as nondurable goods production, clothing in particular, and transport services help offset part of the weak domestic demand.
8. The composition of growth is having a positive impact on the external balance.  Firms’ orientation towards external markets due to the domestic demand outlook, and their flexibility in market diversification stimulate exports of goods. The lagged effects of exchange rates and the modest outlook for loans and economic activity restrain import demand, and external balance continues to improve at an accelerated pace thanks to the upbeat in tourism activity. Thus, the current account balance is expected to maintain its improving trend.
9. Labor market data is relatively weak. According to May 2019 data, nonfarm employment declined while nonfarm unemployment rate rose compared to April figures. Across sectors, industrial employment remained almost flat while employment in the services and construction sectors fell compared to the previous period.
10. In sum, looking forward, net exports are expected to contribute to economic growth and the improvement in risk premium and financial conditions with the help of the disinflation trend is likely to support the gradual recovery. Against this background, aggregate demand conditions are estimated to make a further contribution to disinflation.
Monetary Policy and Risks
11. Global economic activity lost further pace due to the deceleration in the euro area and China in particular, and leading indicators, primarily the manufacturing sector-related data, posted a decline, signaling that the deceleration will continue. The persistent trade tensions between the US and China coupled with the possibility of protectionist measures spreading across other countries, a more apparent slowdown in the euro area, lingering uncertainties regarding the Brexit and other geopolitical developments cause the uncertainty over global economic policies to remain elevated and the vulnerabilities in global financial markets to continue. All these factors keep the downside risks to global economic activity alive.
12. Commodity prices maintain their demand-driven decline due to the deceleration of global economic activity, supporting the disinflation in advanced and emerging economies. Besides the slowdown in global economic activity, the increased excess supply in crude oil points to a moderate course in crude oil prices in the period ahead, yet geopolitical risks remain significant.
13. Recently, advanced economy central banks have started to adopt more expansionary policies as global economic activity weakened and downside risks to inflation heightened. While these developments support the demand for emerging market assets and the risk appetite, rising protectionism and uncertainty regarding global economic policies pose downside risks to these portfolio flows towards emerging markets. These factors are closely monitored in terms of their potential impacts on financial markets and domestic economic activity through both capital flows and international trade.
14. Although Turkey’s risk premium dropped in the second half of June amid a cautious monetary stance, improved macroeconomic indicators and major central banks’ move to quantitative easing, it has been volatile since then. The persistence of high levels of country risk premium and exchange rate volatility as well as ongoing global uncertainties and geopolitical risks keep the upside risks to the medium-term inflation outlook alive.
15. July’s rate cut and expectations of further rate cuts thereafter helped bring loan and deposit rates markedly down from the previous MPC period. Notwithstanding lower deposit rates, the stable Turkish lira and improved inflation expectations drove Turkish lira deposits higher. Consumer loans have been on the rise amid accommodative credit packages and seasonal needs whereas commercial loan growth has been flat due to supply-side effects caused by expectations for the overall economic outlook as well as delayed loan demand and weak investments. Improvement in the liquidity and capital adequacy ratios of banking sector and lower interest rates are likely to provide a boost to loan growth in the upcoming period. The outlook for economic activity will largely depend on the pace, scope and sustainability of the normalization in credit conditions.
16. Despite the restrictive impact of domestic demand conditions on inflation, the current levels of inflation expectations continue to pose an upside risk to the medium-term inflation outlook. Anchoring inflation expectations is crucial for a more effective monetary policy and a reduced inflation-growth tradeoff.
17. The course of food prices constitutes one of the risk factors that may affect the short-term inflation outlook. The accumulated cost effect on processed food prices have mostly terminated and prices in this group have posted a limited rise in August.  The unprocessed food inflation remains favorable. In this framework, the risks that the course of food prices may pose to the short-term inflation outlook are lower than the July Inflation Report forecasts.
18. The inflation outlook continued to improve. Domestic demand conditions and the level of monetary tightness continue to support disinflation. Underlying trend indicators, supply side factors, and import prices lead to an improvement in the inflation outlook. In light of these developments, recent forecast revisions suggest that inflation is likely to materialize slightly below the projections of the July Inflation Report by the end of the year. Accordingly, considering all the factors affecting the inflation outlook, the Committee decided to reduce the policy rate by 325 basis points. At this point, the current monetary policy stance, to a large part, is considered to be consistent with the projected disinflation path.
19. The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is the key for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery.  Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, the extent of the monetary tightness will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives.
20. The Committee emphasized the importance of sustaining the recent improvement in the country risk premium for the price and financial stability objectives. In this context, in order to support the effectiveness of monetary policy and minimize a likely inflation-growth trade-off, it will be crucial that macro-financial policies are determined with a focus on reducing financial volatility and risk premium, and that the predictability of fiscal policy continues to be reinforced.
21. The fiscal policy outlook that the monetary policy is based on incorporates a policy stance that focuses on price stability and macroeconomic rebalancing and that is coordinated with the monetary policy. Accordingly, the monetary policy stance assumes that administered price and tax adjustments are formulated in a way that will help reduce the backward indexation behavior. If the fiscal policy significantly deviates from this framework leading to an adverse impact on the medium-term inflation outlook, the monetary policy stance may be revised.
22. Collective efforts to turn the recently enhanced coordination between monetary and fiscal policies into a sustained and systematic structure are expected to support the achievement of price stability. Moreover, continued structural steps focusing on reducing rigidity and volatility in inflation will contribute to price stability and therefore social welfare.
23. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance."

Decision of the Monetary Policy Committee
Participating Committee Members
Murat Uysal (Governor), Murat Çetinkaya, Ömer Duman, Uğur Namık Küçük, Oğuzhan Özbaş, Emrah Şener, Abdullah Yavaş.
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 16.50 percent to 14 percent.
Recently obtained data indicate that moderate recovery in economic activity continues. Leading indicators point to continuing improvement in the sectoral diffusion of economic activity. However, investment demand remains weak. While industrial production has been highly volatile due to working day effects associated with official holidays in recent months, its underlying trend has maintained a moderate pace of growth. While favorable effects of improved competitiveness prevail, weakening global economic outlook tempers external demand. Looking forward, net exports are expected to contribute to economic growth, although to a lesser extent, and the gradual recovery is likely to continue with the help of the disinflation trend and improvement in financial conditions. Current account balance, which has recently recorded significant improvement due to the composition of growth, is expected to maintain a moderate course.
Recently, advanced economy central banks have been pursuing more expansionary policies as weakening global economic activity and downside risks to inflation became more evident. While these developments support the demand for emerging market assets and the risk appetite, rising protectionism and uncertainty regarding global economic policies are closely monitored in terms of their impact on both capital flows and international trade.  
Inflation outlook continued to improve. In addition to the stable course of the Turkish lira, improvement in inflation expectations and mild domestic demand conditions supported the disinflation in core indicators. In September, with the contribution of strong base effects, consumer inflation displayed a significant fall particularly in core goods and food inflation. Domestic demand conditions and the level of monetary tightness continue to support disinflation. Underlying trend indicators, supply side factors, and import prices lead to an improvement in the inflation outlook. In light of these developments, recent forecast revisions suggest that inflation is likely to materialize notably below the projections of the July Inflation Report by the end of the year. Accordingly, considering all the factors affecting inflation outlook, the Committee decided to reduce the policy rate by 250 basis points. At this point, the current monetary policy stance, to a large part, is considered to be consistent with the projected disinflation path. 
The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is the key for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery.  Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, the extent of the monetary tightness will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

2019,31 October 2019,Press Release on Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting,"No: 2019-44
31 October 2019
Press Release on Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 24 October 2019
Inflation Developments
1. In September, consumer prices rose by 0.99%, while annual inflation decreased by 5.75 points to 9.26%. In September, with the contribution of strong base effects, consumer inflation displayed a significant fall particularly in core goods and food inflation. In addition to the stable course of the Turkish lira, improvement in inflation expectations and mild domestic demand conditions supported the disinflation in core indicators. Against this background, core indicators B and C maintained their mild course. 
2. In the food and non-alcoholic beverages group, annual inflation fell by 7.70 points to 9.52% in September. This fall was led by the favorable courses of unprocessed and processed food prices as well as the strong base effect. The decline in inflation in fresh fruits and vegetables shaped the course of the unprocessed food inflation. Meanwhile, processed food prices, on the other hand, displayed a moderate increase across the subcategories, excluding tea prices.
3. In September, energy prices rose by 3.17%, while annual energy inflation declined to 4.86% due to the base effect. In this period, the impact of the adjustments in natural gas prices proved evident, and fuel prices also increased in tandem with the developments in the exchange rate and oil prices. Meanwhile, the sliding scale system contained a worse outlook in fuel prices. The course of energy prices in October will be shaped by the adjustment in electricity prices.
4. In September, annual core goods inflation decreased by 10.04 points to 2.98%, mainly due to the base effect. Annual inflation declined in all subgroups, with durables and other core goods in the lead. Despite price increases in white goods, prices of durable goods registered a slight month-on-month decline due to automobile prices. Prices of other core goods recorded an increase after the decline in August. Besides the strong base effect, the outlook of the Turkish lira and the mild course of domestic demand were influential in the course of core goods inflation in this period.
5. Services prices rose by 1.47% in September, while annual services inflation went down by 1.65 points to 12.54%. Annual inflation increased in the transport group, but declined in the restaurants-hotels and other services groups due to the base effect and remained almost unchanged in the communication group and rent. In transport services, price hikes particularly in urban transport fares (municipality bus, taxi, train etc.) were influential. The downward impact of domestic demand conditions on services inflation have recently been restrained by real unit labor costs, cumulative cost increases in some items and the backward indexation behavior.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6. Recently obtained data indicate that moderate recovery in economic activity continues. While industrial production has been highly volatile due to working day effects associated with official holidays in recent months, its underlying trend has maintained a moderate pace of growth. In August, the industrial production adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects decreased by 2.8% month-on-month. Working day losses due to the bridging of the Feast of Sacrifice holiday with the weekend and the correction made in other transportation vehicles sector that is volatile in general limited the industrial production significantly in August. In light of a technical recovery to be enabled by the removal of those effects peculiar to August and the favorable outlook in leading indicators, the September industrial production is expected to resume its monthly growth.
7. Leading indicators point to continuing improvement in the sectoral diffusion of economic activity. While the weak labor market outlook and the expiry of tax cuts limited private consumption, the continued improvement in public expenditures and financial conditions underpinned the domestic demand. Indicators such as the CBRT Business Tendency Survey, PMI and sectoral confidence indices hint at an ongoing improvement in the manufacturing industry and services activities. Information obtained during the interviews conducted with firms in this period also gave similar signals regarding the economic activity. Investments, on the other hand, remain weak despite showing signs of a slight recovery starting from the third quarter.
8. The recent slowdown in the global growth outlook, particularly in the EU, became more apparent. While favorable effects of improved competitiveness prevail, weakening global economic outlook tempers external demand. In the third quarter, the exports of goods and services contributed further to growth on the back of market diversity and the strong course in tourism, while the recovery in the domestic demand had implications on imports. Looking forward, net exports are expected to contribute to economic growth, although to a lesser extent, and the gradual recovery of the economy is likely to continue with the help of the disinflation trend and improvement in financial conditions. In this context, the current account balance, which has recently recorded significant improvement due to the composition of growth, is expected to maintain a moderate course.
9. Labor market data is relatively weak. According to July 2019 data, nonfarm employment declined while nonfarm unemployment rate continued to rise compared to June figures. Across sectors, industrial and services employment remained almost flat, while employment in the construction sector continued to fall compared to the previous period.
Monetary Policy and Risks
10. The weakening in global economic activity became more pronounced. Protectionist trade policies and heightened geopolitical uncertainties have noticeably increased the uncertainty regarding global economic policies. These developments keep downside risks to global economic activity alive and should be monitored closely in terms of their impacts on domestic growth via both capital flows and international trade channels.
11. The weak global economic activity depresses commodity prices and leads to a mild course in crude oil prices despite supply-side hurdles arising from geopolitical developments. Accordingly, global inflation rates remain flat.
12. Recently, advanced economy central banks have been pursuing more expansionary policies as weakening global economic activity and downside risks to inflation became more evident. These developments reflect a more favorable outlook for global financial conditions and support the demand for emerging market assets and the risk appetite. On the other hand, rising protectionism and the uncertainty regarding global economic policies restrain capital flows to emerging markets and add to downside risks for the upcoming period. 
13. Although Turkey’s risk premium dropped in September owing to a cautious monetary policy stance and improved macroeconomic indicators as well as major central banks’ move to expansionary policy stance, it has been up and volatile afterwards due to geopolitical tensions. The elevated levels of the country risk premium and the exchange rate volatility amid global and geopolitical uncertainties keep upside risks to the medium-term inflation outlook alive.
14. The strong rate cuts in July and September and expectations of further rate cuts thereafter helped bring loan and deposit rates further down. Thus, TL-denominated commercial and consumer loan rates dropped significantly while improved financing conditions and growing domestic demand helped total loans, consumer loans in particular, gain momentum. Consumer loans have seen an upswing since early August while commercial loans have been on a more modest rise. This upturn can be attributed to supply-side effects caused by expectations for the overall economic outlook as well as delayed loan demand. Moreover, as part of the scheme in which required reserves are being more flexibly and effectively used to support financial stability, the decision to decrease TL required reserve ratios and to raise the remuneration rate for TL required reserves for those banks having TL credit growth rates between 10-20 percent also contributed to the recovery in credit. Improved liquidity and capital adequacy ratios of the banking sector and lower interest rates are likely to provide a boost to loan growth in the upcoming period. In addition, NPLs and Stage 2 loans are monitored closely for any impact they might have on banks’ loan supply in the short term. Employment and income developments will determine if the recent rate cut-driven rebound in loan demand will persist. The pace, scope and sustainability of the normalization in credit conditions will be important for the outlook for economic activity.
15. Despite the restrictive impact of domestic demand conditions on inflation, the current levels of inflation expectations continue to pose an upside risk to the medium-term inflation outlook. Anchoring inflation expectations is crucial for a more effective monetary policy and a reduced inflation-growth trade-off.
16. The inflation outlook continued to improve. Domestic demand conditions and the level of policy tightness continue to support disinflation. Underlying trend indicators, supply side factors, and import prices lead to an improvement in the inflation outlook. In light of these developments, recent forecast revisions suggest that inflation is likely to materialize significantly below the projections of the July Inflation Report by the end of the year. Accordingly, considering all the factors affecting the inflation outlook, the Committee decided to reduce the policy rate by 250 basis points. At this point, the current monetary policy stance, to a large extent, is considered to be consistent with the projected disinflation path.
17. The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is the key for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery.  Keeping the disinflation process on track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary policy stance. In this respect, the extent of the monetary tightness will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives.
18. The Committee emphasized the importance of sustaining the improvement in the country risk premium for the price and financial stability objectives. In this context, in order to support the effectiveness of the monetary policy and minimize a likely inflation-growth trade-off, it will be crucial that macro-financial policies are determined with a focus on reducing financial volatility and risk premium, and that the predictability of the fiscal policy continues to be reinforced.
19. The fiscal policy outlook that the monetary policy is based on incorporates a policy stance that focuses on price stability and macroeconomic rebalancing and that is coordinated with the monetary policy. Accordingly, the monetary policy stance assumes that administered price and tax adjustments are formulated in a way that will help reduce the backward indexation behavior. If the fiscal policy significantly deviates from this framework leading to an adverse impact on the medium-term inflation outlook, the monetary policy stance may be revised.
20. Collective efforts to turn the recently enhanced coordination between monetary and fiscal policies into a sustained and systematic framework are expected to support the achievement of price stability. Moreover, continued structural steps focusing on reducing rigidity and volatility in inflation will contribute to price stability and therefore social welfare.
21. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance."

2019,9 December 2019,Press Release on Reserve Requirements,"No: 2019-47
9 December 2019
Press Release on Reserve Requirements
A revision is made to the reserve requirement regulation that links the reserve requirement ratios and remuneration rates to loan growth rates.
The main policy tool of the CBRT is short-term interest rates. Reserve requirements are used flexibly and effectively as a
counter-cyclical macroprudential tool to support this main monetary policy tool. In this regard, as previously announced on 19 August 2019, the reserve requirement ratios for Turkish lira liabilities and the remuneration rates for Turkish lira-denominated required reserves have been linked to the annual growth rates of Turkish lira-denominated cash loans.
On the back of the robust capital and liquidity structure of the banking system, the fall in interest rates driven by the improvement in inflation and expectations, and the recovery trend in economic activity, it is expected that

the favorable outlook in loan supply and demand conditions which started in the second half of 2019 will continue in 2020,
the loan growth will be consistent with the inflation target and growth projections for 2020 and will be mainly driven by Turkish lira loans.

The cautious monetary policy backed by fiscal policy has significantly improved the inflation trend, while the current reserve requirement practice has supported loan growth and financial stability. At this stage of rebalancing in the economy, it is assessed that it will be useful to have a reserve requirement practice that will underpin financial stability by encouraging the channeling of loan supply to production-oriented sectors rather than consumption-oriented ones and that will reduce the need to update the band width.  
In this framework, considering also the low base effect on loans in 2019, a revision is made in the reserve requirements. According to new regulation,
(i) The real change in Turkish lira cash loans will be taken into account in the calculation of loan growth.
(ii) The real annual growth rate of loans will be calculated based on the last three-month average of the real cash loan stock values, and the calculations will exclude the loans extended to financial institutions.
(iii) The real cash loan value will be calculated via dividing the nominal loan amount by the CPI in the relevant period.
(iv) Banks will be able to benefit from reserve requirement incentives under the following conditions:
a. For banks with a real annual loan growth rate above 15%: If their adjusted real loan growth rate, which is calculated by deducting the entire real changes in the commercial loans with a two-year and longer maturity and housing loans with a five-year and longer maturity from the numerator of the growth rate formula, is below 15%,
b. For banks with a real annual loan growth rate below 15%: If their adjusted real loan growth rate, which is calculated by deducting 50% of the real change in retail loans excluding housing loans with a five-year and longer maturity from the numerator of the growth rate formula, is above 5%.
Thus, long-term commercial loans that have a strong relation with production and investment, and long-term housing loans that have a weak relation with imports will be encouraged.
(v) Loan growth rates will be calculated for every reserve requirement period, and banks with real annual loan growth rates complying with the defined conditions will be subject to related reserve requirement ratios and remuneration rates throughout the following three months (six reserve requirement maintenance periods).  
(vi) The implementation will be valid from the calculation period dated 29 November 2019. The rights of banks, which have earned the right to lower reserve requirement ratios and higher remuneration rates under the previous method as of this calculation period, will be reserved.

Decision of the Monetary Policy Committee
Participating Committee Members
Murat Uysal (Governor), Murat Çetinkaya, Ömer Duman, Uğur Namık Küçük, Oğuzhan Özbaş, Emrah Şener, Abdullah Yavaş.
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 14 percent to 12 percent.
Recent data indicate that recovery in economic activity continues. Sectoral diffusion of economic activity continues to improve. However, investment demand remains weak. While favorable effects of improved competitiveness prevail, weakening global economic outlook tempers external demand. As the contribution of net exports to economic growth declines, economic recovery is expected to be sustained with the help of the ongoing disinflation process and improvement in financial conditions. Current account balance, which has recently recorded significant improvement, is expected to maintain a moderate course with the contribution of supportive policy measures.
Weakness in global economic activity and low levels of global inflation strengthen expectations regarding the continuation of expansionary monetary policies in advanced economies. While current global financial conditions support the demand for emerging market assets and the risk appetite, rising protectionism and uncertainty regarding global economic policies are closely monitored in terms of their impact on both capital flows and international trade.  
Inflation outlook continued to improve while inflation expectations displayed a wide-spread decline.  Thanks to the stable course of the Turkish lira as well as the developments in domestic demand conditions and producer prices, core inflation indicators have displayed a mild trend. The improvement in macroeconomic indicators, inflation in particular, supports the fall in country risk premium and contributes to a benign outlook in cost factors. Underlying trend indicators, supply side factors and import prices lead to an improvement in the inflation outlook. In light of these developments, recent forecasts suggest that inflation is likely to materialize close to the lower bound of the October Inflation Report projections for the end of the year, with risks around the disinflation path for 2020 being balanced. Accordingly, considering all the factors affecting inflation outlook, the Committee decided to reduce the policy rate by 200 basis points. At this point, the current monetary policy stance is considered to be consistent with the projected disinflation path. 
The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is the key for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery.  Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, the extent of the monetary tightness will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.

19 December 2019
Press Release on Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 12 December 2019
Inflation Developments
1. In November, consumer prices increased by 0.38% while annual inflation rose by 2.01 points to 10.56%. The rise in annual inflation was largely driven by the base effect recorded in the core goods group due to the temporary tax cuts in the same period of the previous year. In this period, annual inflation increased in core goods, food, and energy groups while it remained relatively flat in the services group. Although annual inflation in core indicators was up due to the base effect, the B and C indices maintained their mild trend thanks to the stable course of the Turkish lira, the improvement in inflation expectations, and the developments in domestic demand conditions and producer prices.
2. Annual inflation in the food and non-alcoholic beverages group rose by 1.04 points to 8.89% in November. This rise was primarily driven by the unprocessed food group. Unprocessed food prices displayed a favorable outlook in this period but annual inflation in this group increased due to the low base effect from last year. Meanwhile, the monthly rate of increase in processed food prices somewhat accelerated. This acceleration is also expected to continue in December, led by dairy products in line with the developments in purchasing prices of raw milk.
3. In November, energy prices were up by 0.55% while annual energy inflation increased by 1.34 points to 7.34%. This increase was mainly due to the hikes in bottled gas and fuel prices driven by the rise in oil prices. It should be noted that annual inflation in the energy group will be in an upward trend in the next two months due to the low base effects.
4. Annual core goods inflation surged by 4.65 points to 6.57% in this period due to the effect of the durable goods group in particular. Although durable goods prices remained flat in November on the back of both the stable outlook in the Turkish lira and the moderate course of domestic demand conditions, annual inflation in this group posted a significant increase due to the low base effect stemming from the temporary tax cuts in the same period of the previous year. While annual inflation in the clothing and footwear group remained almost flat at a low level, it slightly receded in the other core goods group. The stable course of the Turkish lira and the current trend in producer prices favorably affect the short-term inflation outlook in the core goods group.
5. Services prices increased by 0.16% in November, and annual services inflation rose by 0.15 points to 12.16%. While annual inflation remained flat in rents, it declined in the restaurants-hotels group and slightly increased in transport, communication and other services. Monthly price hikes in catering services in the restaurants-hotels group significantly slowed down in line with the moderate course of food prices. In this period, despite the curbing effects driven by domestic demand and Turkish lira, services inflation remained elevated due to the backward-indexation behavior, real unit labor costs, and the lagged price hikes in the sub-items of administered transport services.
6.The improvement in inflation expectations continues. The downtrend in 12-month ahead inflation expectations persists while the distribution of expectations implies an increased consensus among survey participants in December, which indicates that uncertainties regarding the medium-term inflation outlook has significantly decreased.
Factors Affecting Inflation
7. Recent data indicate that moderate recovery in economic activity continues. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rose by 0.9% in the third quarter of 2019, while the data adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects edged up by 0.4%. Main driver of quarterly growth proved to be consumption expenditures. Due to the robust increase in machinery-equipment investments, the downtrend in total investments came to a halt. Although the uptrend in exports of goods and services remained intact, the contribution of net exports to annual and quarterly growth was negative due to the rebound in imports.
8. As risk premium, exchange rate volatility and uncertainties have declined, improved financial conditions and accelerated loans have supported domestic demand in the last quarter of the year. Despite the weakness in the labor market, private consumption has been increasing on the back of postponed demand. In addition, public expenditures continue to boost growth through the consumption channel.
9. Sectoral diffusion of economic activity continues to improve. Indicators such as the CBRT Business Tendency Survey, PMI and sectoral confidence indices hint at an ongoing improvement in the manufacturing industry and services activities. Although investment remains weak, survey indicators show that in addition to large firms in the manufacturing industry which have higher investment appetite, investment tendency in small and medium-sized firms have also started to recover after bottoming out. The Committee emphasized the importance of stable growth and demand for a sustainable improvement in investment and employment.
10. While favorable effects of improved competitiveness prevail, weakening global economic outlook tempers external demand. In addition to the EU, MENA countries also signaled for a partial slowdown in this period. While flexibility in market diversification and strong course in tourism support exports of goods and services, the recovery in domestic demand stimulates imports. Against this background, in the last quarter of the year, it is expected that the contribution of net exports to economic growth will decline, and the current account balance, which has recently recorded significant improvement, will maintain a moderate course with the contribution of supportive policy measures.
11. Labor market data is relatively weak. Despite the rise in nonfarm employment in the third quarter, nonfarm unemployment rate continued to rise. Compared to the second quarter, industrial employment remained flat in the third quarter, and services employment increased, while the downtrend in the construction employment continued, although to a lesser extent. Leading indicators signal for a partial recovery in the labor market in the last quarter of the year.
12. In sum, in the upcoming period, as the contribution of net exports to economic growth declines, economic recovery is expected to be sustained with the help of the ongoing disinflation process and improvement in financial conditions.
Monetary Policy and Risks
13. Global economic activity continued to slow down in the third quarter of the year. Leading indicators for the next quarter indicate that the ongoing global slowdown in the manufacturing industry might have also fed into the services sector. These developments keep the downside risks to global economic activity alive. The resulting likely effects on domestic growth are monitored closely.
14. Weak global economic activity depresses commodity prices and leads to a mild course in crude oil prices despite supply-side hurdles arising from geopolitical developments. Accordingly, global inflation rates remain flat.
15. Weakness in global economic activity and low levels of global inflation strengthen expectations regarding the continuation of expansionary monetary policies in advanced economies. The expectation that recently adopted accommodative stance of monetary policies in advanced economies, the US in particular, is likely to be maintained over a medium term horizon under current circumstances, and its implications for global financial conditions support the demand for emerging market assets and the risk appetite. Accordingly, amid recent positive expectations regarding a likely settlement of the trade tension between the US and China, global risk appetite has increased slightly compared to the previous meeting period and portfolio flows towards emerging economies have presented a more favorable outlook. Meanwhile, rising protectionism and uncertainty regarding global economic policies are closely monitored in terms of their impact on both capital flows and international trade.
16. Turkey’s risk premium continued to decline owing to a cautious monetary policy stance and improved macroeconomic indicators as well as the accommodative monetary policy outlook in advanced economies. The decline in the short-term exchange rate volatility has also become more pronounced following the previous meeting period. However, possible upside effects of global and geopolitical uncertainties on the medium-term inflation outlook through country risk premium and exchange rate volatility channels will continue to be monitored closely.
17. The strong rate cuts since July and expectations of further rate cuts thereafter helped bring loan and deposit rates further down. Thus, TL-denominated commercial and consumer loan rates dropped significantly due also to the improvement in inflation expectations, while improved financing conditions and growing domestic demand helped total loans, consumer loans in particular, accelerate. Consumer loans have seen an upswing since early August while corporate loan growth gained pace with a lag. This can be attributed to supply-side effects caused by expectations for the overall economic outlook as well as postponed loan demand.
18. The more flexible and effective use of required reserves as a countercyclical macroprudential tool in this period supports credit growth and financial stability. In this context, firstly on 19 August 2019, Turkish lira reserve requirement ratios and the remuneration rate on Turkish lira denominated required reserves were linked to annual growth rates of Turkish lira cash credits. Moreover, on 9 December 2019, considering the level of rebalancing in the economy, a new reserve requirement practice was introduced to channel credit supply towards production-oriented sectors rather than consumption. Thus, long-term commercial loans that have a strong relation with production and investment and long-term mortgage loans that have a weak relation with imports will be encouraged. In the upcoming period, with the improvement in liquidity and capital adequacy ratios of the banking sector, the fall in interest rates and adjustments in required reserves are expected to further support credit growth. In addition, NPLs and Stage 2 loans are monitored closely for any impact they might have on banks’ loan supply in the short term. Employment and income developments will determine if the recent rate cut-driven rebound in loan demand will persist. The pace, scope and sustainability of the normalization in credit conditions will be important for the outlook for economic activity.
19. Inflation outlook continued to improve while inflation expectations displayed a wide-spread decline. Thanks to the stable course of the Turkish lira as well as the developments in domestic demand conditions and producer prices, core inflation indicators have displayed a mild trend. The improvement in macroeconomic indicators, inflation in particular, supports the fall in country risk premium and contributes to a benign outlook in cost factors. Underlying trend indicators, supply side factors and import prices lead to an improvement in the inflation outlook. In light of these developments, recent forecasts suggest that inflation is likely to materialize close to the lower bound of the October Inflation Report projections for the end of the year, with risks around the disinflation path for 2020 being balanced. Accordingly, considering all the factors affecting inflation outlook, the Committee decided to reduce the policy rate by 200 basis points. At this point, the current monetary policy stance is considered to be consistent with the projected disinflation path.
20. The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is the key for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, the extent of the monetary tightness will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives.
21. The Committee emphasized the importance of sustaining the improvement in the country risk premium for the price and financial stability objectives. In this context, in order to support the effectiveness of the monetary policy and minimize a likely inflation-growth trade-off, it will be crucial that macro-financial policies are determined with a focus on reducing financial volatility and risk premium, and that the predictability of the fiscal policy continues to be reinforced.
22. The fiscal policy outlook that the monetary policy is based on incorporates a policy stance that focuses on price stability and macroeconomic rebalancing and that is coordinated with the monetary policy. Accordingly, the monetary policy stance assumes that administered price and tax adjustments are formulated in a way that will help reduce the backward indexation behavior. If the fiscal policy significantly deviates from this framework leading to an adverse impact on the medium-term inflation outlook, the monetary policy stance may be revised.
23. Collective efforts to turn the recently enhanced coordination between monetary and fiscal policies into a sustained and systematic framework are expected to support the achievement of price stability. Moreover, continued structural steps focusing on reducing rigidity and volatility in inflation will contribute to price stability and therefore social welfare.
24. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance."

25 January 2018
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 18 January 2018
 
Inflation Developments
1. In December, consumer prices rose by 0.69 percent, and annual inflation dropped by 1.06 points to 11.92 percent. Annual inflation recorded a decline in food and energy groups, but increased in the core goods group. The fall in food inflation was led by the unprocessed group, while core goods group was largely affected by the cumulative depreciation in the Turkish lira. Against these developments, annual inflation in core indicators increased slightly and their underlying trend remained high.
2. In December, annual inflation in food and nonalcoholic beverages receded by 1.99 points to 13.79 percent. This fall was largely driven by unprocessed food prices due to the base effect accompanied by the sustained decline in red meat prices. Meanwhile, having soared lately, processed food prices rose moderately in December. The surge in prices of cheese and other dairy products in recent months turned flat due to the muted rise in raw milk prices. In line with red meat prices, processed meat products recorded a decline. Owing to the change in the basis weight in the Bread Communique, processed food prices entail the risk of an upsurge in January. Nevertheless, leading indicators for January hint at a downtrend in the annual food inflation to be led by the unprocessed food group.
3. The uptrend in international oil prices weigh on energy prices. Accordingly, energy prices registered an increase in December, yet the group’s annual inflation declined due to the base effect. Despite the increase in electricity prices, leading indicators hint at a similar decline in energy inflation due to the base effect in January as well.
4. Prices of services inched up by 0.43 percent in December and the annual services inflation remained almost unchanged at 9.47 percent. In this period annual inflation increased in transport services; remained relatively flat in the restaurants-hotels and communications group, but decreased in other groups. Fuel prices, which surged amid the depreciated Turkish lira coupled with the rise in oil prices, aggravate inflation in transport services. Meanwhile, the robust course of demand conditions in certain groups and the headline-inflation indexation stiffens the elevated levels in services inflation.
5. Annual core goods inflation crept up by 0.40 points and reached 15.45 percent in December. This was led by the prices of durable goods that increased parallel to the soaring prices of automobiles and white goods. Thus, inflation in durable goods reached 18 percent. Price increases in other core goods accelerated in tandem with the cumulative exchange rate effects in products with high import component. The effect of the methodological change in the clothing group continued with a weaker pace. The rebound in manufacturing in the clothing sector coupled with the improvement in tourism fueled the rise in group’s inflation across the year.
6. In sum, current elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations continue to pose risks on the pricing behavior.
Factors Affecting Inflation
7. Recently-released data indicate that economic activity maintains its strength. A joint analysis of October and November data suggests sustained growth in industrial production with some deceleration in the fourth quarter. However, this deceleration stems from the slowing activity in sectors subject to tax incentives, particularly furniture, and other sectors do not register a loss of momentum. Survey indicators show that this trend is maintained in December as well. Indicators for services and trade stand moderate, while the recovery in the tourism sector spurs economic activity further.
8. Domestic demand continues to expand. In the fourth quarter, private consumption growth is expected to lose some pace following the withdrawal of tax reductions in white goods and furniture. On the other hand, current indicators show that the third-quarter improvement in machinery-equipment investments continues.
9. The improving growth outlook across the globe, particularly in the EU, rising external demand and Turkey’s flexibility to shift markets abroad continue to stimulate exports. The improvement in the import demand in tandem with the course of economic activity notwithstanding, the rise in exports of goods slows the deterioration in the core current account deficit indicators. In addition to the ongoing recovery in tourism, the uptrend in exports of goods is envisaged to contribute further to the current account balance. The Committee noted that the contribution of net exports to quarterly GDP growth will continue in the fourth quarter owing to the strong course of exports accompanied by the slowing gold imports.
10. The second and third-quarter recovery in the labor market continued in the October period, confirming that economic activity remains robust. Employment increased in services and industry, but receded in the construction sector compared to the previous period. Survey data suggest the rise in employment coupled with the fall in unemployment rates will continue. The Committee highlighted that employment gains failed to fully pass through to unemployment rates due to the strong uptrend in the labor force participation rate. Against this background, the unemployment rate is anticipated to decline gradually in the period ahead.
11. In sum, recently released data indicate that economic activity maintains its strength. Domestic demand continues to expand and external demand contributes positively to exports.
Monetary Policy and Risks
12. Data on global growth hint at continued simultaneous recovery in both advanced and emerging economies. PMI indicators pointing to growth for both markets and the upgraded growth forecasts, particularly for the euro area, confirm the steady economic rebound across the globe. Global inflation has been volatile amid changing commodity and oil prices yet remains low, whereas global core inflation remains stable.
13. The primary downside risks to the global economic outlook over the upcoming period are the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and the Korean peninsula and the heightened protectionism clouding international trade negotiations. Moreover, the US tax reform is considered a positive risk factor for the world economy.
14. With the Federal Reserve and the ECB in the lead, major central banks continue to normalize monetary policy. As the steps towards normalization have been in line with expectations, the market reaction is currently mild. However, risks to monetary policy tightening are more on the upside. With the ongoing economic recovery in the US, the Fed demonstrated its commitment to policy normalization. The strengthening euro area economy increases the possibility of an earlier-than-anticipated tightening of the ECB monetary policy. Despite the favorable course of the labor market in advanced countries, the limited increase in wages, while limiting price increases, poses an upward risk in terms of inflation in the upcoming period. Another key factor that might deteriorate the stable global inflation is the recent movements in oil prices.
15. The favorable global economic outlook and trade volume as well as the ongoing global risk appetite drive strong portfolio flows into emerging economies. In 2018, it is estimated that portfolio inflows will continue in the case of sustained economic recovery and a moderate course in monetary policy normalization of advanced economies. Meanwhile, portfolio investments to Turkey may at times be volatile amid geopolitical risks.
16. Both global and domestic financial conditions have generally been supportive of economic activity. Since the December MPC meeting, financial indicators such as exchange rate volatility, market interest rates and risk premium have alleviated thanks to the CBRT policies and the interruption in the negative news flow. Due to the CBRT’s tighter monetary stance, the downward slope of the yield curve has become more pronounced. The loan growth that hovers around historical averages as the loans guaranteed by the Credit Guarantee Fund hit the pre-determined upper limit in mid-2017 is monitored closely with regard to its impact on aggregate demand and economic activity.
17. Domestic demand has slowed slightly due to the reduced support of the additional credit boost to growth and the withdrawal of tax incentives for durable goods, and economic growth has started to move towards its underlying trend as of the fourth quarter of 2017. The accommodative policies of 2017 will have less of an effect in 2018 while the fiscal measures to be introduced within the context of the Medium Term Program and the tight monetary stance are expected to be the main drivers of loan growth and a normalized economic activity. Moreover, the smaller yet ongoing Credit Guarantee Fund support will support domestic demand in 2018. The steady recovery in tourism, the improving global growth outlook and the favorable course of the real exchange rate are expected to contribute further to growth and the current account balance in the coming months through the export channel. Against this background, uncertainties over monetary policies of major central banks, the course of capital flows and geopolitical developments remain key to economic activity. Exchange rate volatility that may arise from such factors poses a downside risk to the timing and strength of the support that financial conditions could provide to economic activity.
18. Current elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations continue to pose risks on the pricing behavior. Having pulled annual consumer inflation down in December largely on the back of base effects and weather conditions, food and energy prices might shape consumer prices over the first quarter of 2018, particularly due to upward and downward volatility in unprocessed food prices. In addition, changes in oil prices put upward pressure on domestic energy prices. Meanwhile, core goods inflation remains on the rise amid cumulative exchange rate effects, and aggregate demand conditions support this uptrend. Given also the elevated services inflation, the Committee assesses that there is no significant improvement in the core inflation outlook.
19. Accordingly, the Committee decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance and kept the Late Liquidity Window (LON) lending rate at 12.75 percent. The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. The tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until the inflation outlook displays a significant improvement, independent of base effects and temporary factors, and becomes consistent with the targets. The Committee formulates monetary policy by taking the medium-term inflation into account, thus focusing on the developments in underlying inflation rather than the anticipated fluctuations driven by the base effects during the course of the year. Inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored, and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.
20. Developments in fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices and taxes. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
21. In recent years, sustaining fiscal discipline has been one of the key factors in lowering the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks. The room provided by fiscal discipline facilitated the implementation of an expansionary fiscal policy. Structural measures to provide room for counter-cyclical fiscal policies will enhance the coordination of monetary and fiscal policy, and improve macroeconomic stability. Moreover, continuation of structural steps to reduce inertia and volatility in inflation will contribute positively to the price stability process and social welfare."

Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 7 March 2018
Inflation Developments
1. In February, consumer prices rose by 0.73 percent and annual inflation receded by 0.09 points to 10.26 percent. Annual inflation was down in energy and core goods, but up in food and services. Energy inflation was pulled down by falling oil prices as well as relatively stable exchange rates. Annual core goods inflation slowed slightly while food inflation was driven higher by both processed and unprocessed food prices. Thus, the annual inflation of core indicators recorded a small decrease while their underlying trend remained high.
 
2. Annual inflation in food and nonalcoholic beverages was up by 1.51 points to 10.27 percent in February. Annual unprocessed food inflation accelerated to 6.71 percent, due to rising prices of fresh fruits and vegetables as well as higher milk and red meat prices. On this account, being adversely affected, annual processed food inflation hit a nine-year high of 13.76 percent. In this category, prices of cheese and other dairy goods, fats and processed meat recorded sharp gains. In addition, bread prices that went up due to the adjustment in the Bread Regulation and prices of nonalcoholic beverages that were driven higher by the new Special Consumption Tax (SCT) applied to some beverages put upward pressure on annual processed food inflation. 
 
3. Energy prices fell by 0.58 percent in February amid sliding international oil prices and moderating exchange rates, and annual inflation dropped to 6.92 percent in this category.  
 
4. Annual services inflation increased by 0.14 points to 9.37 percent in February, largely due to the subcategory of other services, the inflation of which was pushed up by rising prices of package tours and health services. Meanwhile, annual inflation was relatively flat in rents, restaurants-hotels and telecommunications, but continued to decline in transport services.
 
5. Annual core goods inflation fell by 0.65 points to 14.93 percent in February. Annual inflation was down across all subcategories yet remained high. The rise in annual clothing inflation was prompted by cumulative cost developments and robust aggregate demand conditions. Prices of durable goods posted a month-on-month increase due to furniture and automobile prices. Other core goods, on the other hand, saw a lower annual inflation rate thanks to base effects but their prices were up due to home maintenance-repair and medicines. It should be noted that the remaining impact of the mid-February increase of 15 percent in medicine prices caused by the reference exchange rate will also be felt in March.
 
6. In sum, current elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations continue to pose risks to the pricing behavior. Underlying trend indicators display inertia and core inflation remains elevated.
 
Factors Affecting Inflation
7. Recently released data indicate that economic activity maintains its strength. Industrial production continued to grow in the fourth quarter, albeit at a slower rate. However, this deceleration stems from the slack in sectors subject to tax incentives, particularly furniture, whereas other sectors see no loss of momentum. Survey indicators hint at strong industrial output across subsectors for January and February. Indicators for services and trade remain moderate while the tourism rebound bolsters economic growth.
 
8. Domestic demand continues to expand. Private consumption growth is expected to lose some pace over the fourth quarter following the expired tax incentives for home appliances and furniture. On the other hand, current indicators show that machinery-equipment investments have been improving since the third quarter. 
 
9. The upbeat growth outlook across the globe, particularly in the European Union (EU), rising external demand and Turkey’s flexibility in diversifying export markets continue to stimulate exports. Notwithstanding the recovering import demand aided by the buoyant economy, gains in exports of goods helped slow down the deterioration of the core current-account-deficit indicators. The uptrend in exports of goods, coupled with the ongoing tourism rebound, will likely contribute further to the current account balance over the upcoming period. The Committee noted that the contribution of net exports to quarterly GDP growth will increase in the fourth quarter owing to brisk exports accompanied by slowing gold imports. 
 
10. The second and third-quarter recovery in the labor market continued into the fourth quarter, confirming that economic activity remains strong. Employment surged in services and construction sectors in this period, but remained constant in the industrial sector compared to the previous period. Survey data hints at further employment gains and lower unemployment rates for the upcoming period. The Committee highlighted that employment gains failed to fully pass through to unemployment rates due to the upswing in labor force participation. Thus, unemployment rates are expected to decline gradually in the period ahead.
 
11. In short, recently released data indicate that economic activity maintains its strength. Domestic demand continues to expand and external demand contributes positively to exports.
 
Monetary Policy and Risks
12. Fourth-quarter data of the previous year on global growth signal continued simultaneous recovery in both advanced and emerging economies. PMI indicators pointing to growth for both markets and the upgraded growth forecasts, particularly for the EU, confirm the steady economic rebound across the globe.
 
13. The primary downside risks to the global economic outlook for the upcoming period are the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and the heightened protectionism clouding international trade negotiations. In fact, the recent US plan to impose extra customs tariffs on imported steel and aluminum might spark more protectionism in foreign trade across the world. Moreover, the newly passed US tax reform has provided a growth boost to the US and its trading partners, which is considered an upside risk factor for the world economy. 
 
14. Global inflation may fluctuate amid changes in commodity and oil prices, yet remains low, while global core inflation follows a flat course. Upside risks to global inflation reside for the period ahead. Oil prices stand out as a main factor to distort the steady course of global inflation rates. A second risk factor to stimulate global inflation is the possibility of an upsurge in wages following the fall in unemployment rates in advanced economies. In fact, following the announcement of the US labor market data in early February, acceleration in inflation proved more likely.
 
15. With the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the European Central Bank (ECB) in the lead, major central banks continue to normalize monetary policy. However, risks to monetary tightening are more on the upside due to the possibility of accelerating inflation. In fact, higher volatility emerged in global financial markets and, particularly in the US, a decline was witnessed in the stock exchange amid concerns over the possibility of accelerating inflation and faster-than-projected monetary tightening by the Fed following the labor market data in the US. The stronger growth outlook also for the European Union is likely to cause a sooner-than-expected tightening in the ECB’s monetary policy. Unless upside surprises occur in inflation in the period ahead, it is considered that the Fed’s and the ECB’s steps towards normalization will be in line with expectations.
 
16. The favorable global economic outlook and trade volume as well as the ongoing global risk appetite drive strong portfolio flows into emerging economies. The recent sharp movements in the US stock market had more limited impacts on the stock markets of emerging economies with sounder macroeconomic fundamentals compared to the past. It is estimated that portfolio inflows will continue in the case of sustained economic recovery in emerging economies and a moderate course in monetary policy normalization of advanced economies in 2018 as well.
 
17. With the diminishing effect of the macroprudential incentives and the CGF support granted last year in Turkey, credit growth reverted to historical averages. Meanwhile, underpinned also by the robust domestic demand, loan rates trended upwards. In 2018, the release of the new CGF-backed tranches is expected to accelerate the extension of credits, particularly for investment purposes. Financing the new credits, to be extended by banks, through core liabilities and long-term resources is significant. Effects of growth and composition of credits on aggregate demand and economic activity are monitored closely.
 
18. The reduced support of the additional credit boost to growth and the expiry of tax incentives on durable goods have led domestic demand to lose pace and economic growth to move towards its underlying trend as of the fourth quarter of 2017. In 2018, in addition to the fading effect accommodative policies of 2017, the tight monetary stance and the fiscal measures under the MTP are likely to appear as the main drivers of loan growth and a normalized economic activity. Meanwhile, the continued support from the CGF, albeit limited, will stand as a factor to stimulate domestic demand in 2018. The steady recovery in tourism, the improving global growth outlook and the favorable course of the real exchange rate are expected to contribute further to growth and the current account balance in the coming months through the export channel. Against this background, uncertainties over monetary policies of major central banks, the course of capital flows and geopolitical developments remain a key element of economic activity. Exchange rate volatility that may arise from such factors poses a downside risk to the timing and strength of the support that financial conditions could provide to economic activity.
 
19. Current elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations continue to pose risks to the pricing behavior. The hikes in processed food prices in the last couple of months disclose persisting risks to food inflation. Producer-driven cost pressures remain brisk. Costs in energy, particularly electricity, exhibit an uptick. The upbeat economic activity also acts in the appearance of cost pressures on inflation. All these developments maintain brisk risks to the core inflation outlook, particularly to the core goods inflation.
 
20. Accordingly, the Committee decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance and kept the Late Liquidity Window (LON) lending rate at 12.75 percent. The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. The tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until the inflation outlook displays a significant improvement, independent of base effects and temporary factors, and becomes consistent with the targets. The Committee formulates monetary policy by taking the medium-term inflation into account, thus focusing on the developments in underlying inflation rather than the anticipated fluctuations driven by the base effects during the course of the year. Inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored, and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.
 
21. Developments in fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices and taxes. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook. 
 
22. In recent years, sustaining fiscal discipline has been one of the key factors in lowering the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks. The room provided by fiscal discipline facilitated the implementation of an expansionary fiscal policy. Structural measures to provide room for counter-cyclical fiscal policies will enhance the coordination of monetary and fiscal policy, and improve macroeconomic stability.

2 April 2018
Press Release on the Maximum Interest Rates for Credit Cards in Q2 2018
The monthly maximum interest rates that banks can charge on credit card borrowing in the second quarter of 2018 have been left unchanged.
Banks in Turkey, as is the case in other countries, charge higher interest rates for credit card borrowing than they do for consumer loans. The CBRT, therefore, advises credit card holders with short-term credit needs to seek a consumer loan rather than borrowing on personal credit cards.

Decision of the Monetary Policy Committee
Participating Committee Members
Murat Çetinkaya (Governor), Ömer Duman, Erkan Kilimci, Emrah Şener, Murat Uysal.
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates at the following levels:
a)  Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been kept at 9.25 percent and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.25 percent,
b)  One-week repo rate has been kept at 8 percent,
c)   Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, while lending rate has been increased from 12.75 percent to 13.5 percent.
Recently released data indicate that economic activity maintains its strength. Domestic demand continues to expand and external demand contributes positively to exports.
Current elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations continue to pose risks on the pricing behavior. Upside movements in import prices have increased such risks. Accordingly, the Committee decided to implement a measured monetary tightening to support price stability.
The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement, independent of base effects and temporary factors, and becomes consistent with the targets. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.

2018,30 April 2018,Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting,"No: 2018-12
30 April 2018
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 25 April 2018
Inflation Developments
1. In March, consumer prices rose by 0.99 percent and annual inflation edged down by 0.03 points to 10.23 percent. Annual inflation came down in core goods and services, went up in food and energy. Producer-price-driven cost pressures became stronger relative to February. The annual inflation and the underlying trend of core indicators recorded a small decrease, yet remained high.

2. Annual inflation in food and nonalcoholic beverages was up 0.10 points to 10.37 percent in March. Moderating amid mild weather, fresh fruits and vegetables inflation pulled unprocessed food inflation down, while milk and red meat prices soared. These price increases were reflected on processed food prices, as the prices of cheese, other dairy goods, fats and processed meat climbed. Prices remained on the rise for nonalcoholic beverages that were subject to the adjustment in special consumption tax in January. Thus, prices across the processed food category continued to post strong month-on-month increases while the annual processed food inflation reached 14.42 percent. Leading indicators for April point to some deceleration in annual food inflation.

3. Energy prices increased by 0.32 percent in March and annual energy inflation rose to 8.29 percent, largely due to base effects. Energy inflation is expected to register a significant surge in April driven by rising electricity tariffs and also fuel prices due to the weakening Turkish lira and higher oil prices. Given the low base effect from the second quarter of 2017, energy inflation is likely to remain on the rise in the short term.
 
4. Annual services inflation dropped by 0.11 points to 9.26 percent in March, mostly due to the subcategories of transport and other services. Transport inflation decreased on account of intercity passenger transport by road, while other services inflation decreased on account of repair of household appliances and base effects due to package tours. The current levels of inflation and inflation expectations, price increases across exchange-rate-sensitive items, the food inflation outlook and the robust economic activity lead services inflation to remain high. Moreover, real unit labor costs driven higher by wage adjustments hinder more positive inflation outlook for the services sector due to its labor-intensive nature.
 
5. Annual core goods inflation fell by 1.00 point to 13.93 percent. Annual inflation was down across all subcategories yet remained high. Prices of durable goods posted a month-on-month increase due to prices of automobiles and white goods. In the other core goods category, prices saw large monthly increases due to the lagged exchange rate pass-through effects and the spillovers of the February increase in medicine prices caused by the updated reference exchange rate. The recent Turkish lira deprecation worsens the outlook for core goods inflation.
 
6. In sum, the current elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations continue to pose risks on pricing behavior. Upside movements in import prices, particularly for oil, have increased such risks.
Factors Affecting Inflation
7. GDP data confirmed our previous assessments that economic activity would remain strong in the fourth quarter of 2017. The GDP expanded at a quarterly rate of 1.8 percent and an annual rate of 7.3 percent in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, the economy grew by 7.4 percent in 2017.
 
8. Domestic demand was the driver of both quarterly and annual growth in the fourth quarter of 2017. Despite expired tax reductions, private spending rose substantially in the fourth quarter, while public spending provided an accelerated boost to growth. Despite having contributed to annual growth, investment restrained quarterly growth. On the other hand, net exports contributed negatively to both quarterly and annual growth, as total imports registered a sharp increase due to strong domestic demand and historically high gold imports even though exports remained solid.
 
9. Recently released data indicate that economic activity maintains its strength. Survey indicators for the first quarter of 2018 and industrial production data for the January-February period suggest that industrial activity continued to grow, albeit at a slower rate than in the previous quarter. The acceleration in sectors supplying intermediate inputs for construction activity was particularly notable. The robust activity in industries closely associated with tourism, such as textiles and clothing, supported the manufacturing industry output. Survey indicators show some moderation in services and trade activity.
 
10. Domestic demand continues to expand. Indicators point to some moderation in the quarterly growth of private consumption demand. Meanwhile, indicators for investment demand signal a rise in both machinery-equipment and construction investment for the first quarter. The jump in public investment spending and the increased public spending on goods and services were of particular significance in this period.
 
11. The rising external demand led by the favorable global growth outlook and Turkey’s flexibility in diversifying export markets continue to stimulate exports. According to February data, the rebound in tourism is strengthening while the number of tourists from regions whose per capita spending is relatively higher, such as Europe, is increasing. On the other hand, transport and shuttle trading remain strong. Due to the quarterly moderation in private consumption demand, imports of goods and services slowed slightly in the first quarter. The Committee noted that net exports is likely to contribute positively to quarterly growth under these circumstances. Amid the cumulative depreciation of the real exchange rate, the recovering tourism and the strengthening global growth, exports of goods and services are expected to provide further strong stimulus to growth and affect favorably the current account balance. However, the rise in energy prices hinders the improvement in the current account balance.
 
12. The robust economic activity supports the labor market. Nonfarm employment rose month-on-month in January owing to construction and industrial sectors, whereas services employment fell slightly. Leading indicators signal a continued fall in unemployment rates for the first quarter.
 
13. In short, recently released data indicate that economic activity maintains its strength. Domestic demand continues to expand and growing external demand contributes positively to exports.
 
Monetary Policy and Risks
14. Current data on global economy point to stable and strong growth across both advanced and emerging economies. Global growth is estimated to have accelerated in the first quarter, leading to upward revisions to forecasts for 2018. Despite rising commodity and energy prices amid solid growth outlook, consumer and core inflation rates are moderate across the globe.
 
15. The risks to the global economic outlook are tilted to the downside for the upcoming period. The primary downside risks to the global growth outlook are the geopolitical tensions and the growing protectionist agenda in international trade. The newly passed US tax reform is poised to provide a growth boost to the US and its trading partners, which is considered as an upside risk factor for the world economy.
 
16. The US government’s announcement in March to impose additional customs tariffs on imported steel and aluminum might spark more protectionism in international trade across the world. The extent to which such policies will affect global growth will depend on how other trading partners will respond.
 
17. An analysis of risks to global inflation reveals that geopolitical developments coupled with uncertainties regarding trade policies are likely to pose upside risks to commodity prices, particularly to energy and metal prices. Moreover, in line with the falling unemployment rates in advanced economies, the possibility of wages to increase more rapidly than the current trends is among the major risk factors to push inflation up.
 
18. Unless notable upside surprises occur in global inflation under the mentioned risk factors, it is considered that major central banks, the Fed and the ECB in particular, will continue to normalize monetary policy in line with expectations, and the impact on financial markets will remain limited. However, the possibility of accelerated inflation amid strong demand conditions accompanied by surging commodity prices in advanced economies may trigger a faster-than-projected tightening in these countries. In such a case, global financial markets may witness fluctuations as in early February, and emerging economies may face higher volatility in exchange rates and weakening portfolio flows.
 
19. Further ahead, the baseline outlook envisages a sustained support from the favorable global economic outlook to Turkey’s external demand, an increase in portfolio flows, and a decline in commodity prices as implied by the futures markets. Under a potential scenario of waning global growth and rising commodity prices, the Turkish economy may face cost-push inflationary pressures and widened current account deficit. In such a case, the CBRT will formulate the monetary policy response assessing the disinflationary impact of weaker demand conditions in tandem with the second-round effects of cost pressures on inflation. Should this scenario be accompanied by portfolio outflows, the extent of the pass-through from exchange rate depreciation to consumer prices and the potential impact on overall financial stability will shape the monetary policy response as well.
 
20. The volatility in global financial markets in February coupled with geopolitical developments had reflections on domestic financial conditions as well. Accordingly, the risk premium increased slightly, portfolio flows declined, the Turkish lira depreciated with a rise in volatility, and interest rates in financial markets as well as loan rates increased. The credit market reveals that the accelerating effect of the Credit Guarantee Fund (CGF) support of 2017 have dissipated to a great extent. In addition to the developments in commercial loans, the consequences of the deceleration in consumer loans on economic activity are monitored closely. All in all, the domestic financial conditions are expected to remain on the current trajectory, should the rising trend of external interest rates continues as per expectations.
 
21. The fiscal measures and incentives to support the economic activity as well as the CGF-backed credit expansion produced a strong recovery in domestic demand in 2017, thereby weakening the disinflationary transmission of monetary policy. The expansionary effect of these policies, also taking into account the lagged effects, are estimated to have peaked in the first quarter of 2018, and the economic activity is expected to start to revert to its main trend from the second quarter on, which will gradually lessen the effect of aggregate demand conditions on inflation. Turkey’s flexibility in diversifying export markets and the cumulative real exchange rate depreciation, as well as the favorable global growth outlook for 2018 are expected to continue supporting exports and growth. A relatively moderate outlook for domestic demand is expected as a result of the waning effect of the supportive policies. Against this background, uncertainties over monetary policies of major central banks, the course of capital flows and geopolitical developments continue to pose downside risks to growth. Exchange rate volatility that may arise from such factors poses a downside risk to the timing and strength of the support that financial conditions could provide to economic activity.
 
22. In the first quarter of 2018, cost pressures played a significant role in shaping not only producer prices but also consumer prices led also by the robust demand conditions. High levels of inflation and the rise in inflation expectations keep the risks to the pricing behavior alive. For instance, the fact that the producer price inflation improved only slightly in the first quarter despite the relatively mild course of input costs indicates that firms can raise prices more easily in the high inflation environment. Indeed, the diffusion indices show evidence that the economic agents’ tendency to raise prices rose to quite high levels in the first quarter.
 
23. In addition, wage increases hinder the improvement in services inflation because of the sector’s labor-intensive structure. As a result of the significant backward indexation behavior in the service sector, inflation inertia is strong in this sector. Productivity gains are imperative to contain the adverse effect of rigidities arising from wage and price setting behaviors on price stability.
 
24. The risks are on the upside for food inflation, another significant factor underlying the inflation forecasts. Despite a decline in the second half of 2017 due to the import measures, the red meat prices surged in the first quarter of 2018. Given the supply conditions in the sector, the red meat prices constitute an upside risk factor to food prices in the remainder of the year.  The projections for food inflation are based on the assumption that measures taken by the Food Committee will balance considerably the upside risks to food prices.
 
25. The Committee evaluated the medium-term projections to be presented in the April Inflation Report. Accordingly, the inflation forecast for end-2018 was revised upwards by 0.5 points, while that for 2019 was kept intact. Given a tight policy stance that focuses on bringing inflation down, inflation is projected to converge gradually to the 5-percent target, falling to 8.4 percent at the end of 2018, 6.5 percent at the end of 2019, and stabilizing around 5 percent over the medium term.
 
26. The Committee judges that the rigidity in the underlying inflation indicators and the high levels of core inflation in the first quarter continue to pose risks to the pricing behavior, and in addition, that the recent rise in import prices also weighs on these risks. Accordingly, the Committee decided to implement a measured monetary tightening in April to support price stability.
 
27. The Committee also assessed the technical presentations on finalizing the simplification process of the monetary policy’s operational framework and enhancing the predictability of monetary policy.
 
28. The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. The tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until the inflation outlook displays a significant improvement, independent of base effects and temporary factors, and becomes consistent with the targets. Inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored, and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.
 
29. Public finance has been providing more support to disinflation, which confirms the stronger coordination between monetary and fiscal policies. There was no significant inflationary impact arising from tax increases throughout 2017. The joint efforts to transform policy coordination into a continuous and systematic framework will contribute to disinflation in 2018 as well.
 
30. Developments in fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices and taxes. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
 
31. In recent years, sustaining fiscal discipline has been one of the key factors in lowering the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks. The room provided by fiscal discipline facilitated the implementation of an expansionary fiscal policy. Structural measures to provide room for counter-cyclical fiscal policies will enhance the coordination of monetary and fiscal policy, and improve macroeconomic stability. Moreover, sustaining structural steps to reduce inertia and volatility in inflation will contribute positively to the price stability and social welfare."

2018,30 May 2018,Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting,"No: 2018-22
30 May 2018
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 23 May 2018
Global Developments
1. In consideration of recent developments, the Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) reviewed the risk scenarios discussed in the meeting on 25 April 2018 as well as the Inflation Report.
2. Financial conditions have recently tightened in advanced economies. The probability of an accelerated inflation due to brisk demand conditions and rising commodity prices constitutes a risk of triggering a faster-than-projected tightening in monetary policies of these countries. The Federal Reserve (the Fed) is more likely to implement three more policy rate hikes in the remainder of 2018, and the US bond returns have increased. Led also by the appreciation trend in the USD, global financial markets have witnessed fluctuations, the risk sentiment for emerging economies have deteriorated, exchange rates saw depreciation and increased volatility and portfolio flows lost momentum.
3. Fluctuating global financial markets have a tightening effect on domestic financial conditions. Due to geopolitical developments accompanied by prospects for macro indicators such as inflation and the current account deficit, Turkey grew more sensitive against global fluctuations. Due to higher risk premium and lower portfolio flows, the depreciation and volatility in the Turkish lira was higher compared to the currencies of other emerging economies. The depreciation trend in the Turkish lira has gained pace since the third week of May and signaled for unhealthy price formations inconsistent with economic fundamentals.
4. Accordingly, considering the effects of unhealthy price formations and excessive volatilities in the markets on the inflation outlook, the Central Bank has introduced some adjustments for the foreign exchange market since the meeting on 25 April. These adjustments aim at controlled and efficient provision of the liquidity required by the market in times of excessive volatility.
Market Measures 
5. It was announced on 7 May 2018 that the upper limit for the foreign exchange maintenance facility within the reserve options mechanism was lowered from 55 percent to 45 percent, and tranches were re-adjusted. Through this revision, banks were provided with foreign exchange liquidity and Turkish lira liquidity conditions were tightened.
6. With an announcement on 9 May 2018, the daily amount of Foreign Exchange Deposits against Turkish Lira Deposits auctions was raised from 1.25 billion USD to 1.5 billion USD. Accordingly, the maximum total outstanding deposit amount in the auctions of 6.25 billion USD was enabled to amount to 7.5 billion USD. Through the same announcement, the calendar for Turkish lira-settled forward foreign exchange sale auctions to be held in the second quarter of 2018 was updated. Accordingly, the amount of forward foreign exchange sale position was increased to 7.1 billion USD. 
Macroeconomic Outlook and the Policy Rate 
7. In the previous meeting, the Committee viewed the case in which cost-push inflationary pressures on the Turkish economy are accompanied by portfolio outflows as a risk scenario, and stated that the extent of the pass-through from rising exchange rates to consumer prices and the potential impact on overall financial stability will shape the monetary policy response.     
8. Consumer prices rose by 1.87 percent in April, and annual inflation increased by 0.62 points to 10.85 percent. The rise in inflation was mostly due to oil prices and exchange rate-driven increases in prices of energy and core goods. Annual inflation rates and underlying trends of core indicators went up due to developments in core goods. Annual food inflation declined on the back of unprocessed food prices whereas annual inflation in indices B and C increased by 0.59 and 0.80 points to 12.54 and 12.24 percent, respectively. Producer-driven cost pressures were stronger than in the previous month while demand conditions caused cost shocks to have a more significant effect on inflation. 
9. High inflation and rising inflation expectations keep risks to pricing behavior alive. According to diffusion indices, economic agents are much more inclined to raise prices. The inertia in the indicators for underlying inflation trends and the high levels of core inflation continue to pose risks to pricing behavior. In addition, the recent increases in import prices, particularly for oil, add to these risks.
10. After a robust first quarter, economic activity has begun to converge to its underlying trend as of the second quarter of 2018. Although aggregate demand conditions are likely to have a steadily waning effect on inflation, the cost pressures from the recent Turkish lira depreciation and their potential second-round effects weigh on the inflation outlook. 
11. In sum, the recent unhealthy price formations in the markets and the ongoing increase in inflation expectations continue to pose risks to pricing behavior. Against this background, the Committee decided to implement a strong monetary tightening to support price stability. Accordingly, the Late Liquidity Window lending rate was raised from 13.5 to 16.5 percent.
12. At the meeting, the Committee also agreed to simplify the operational framework shortly in order to enhance the predictability of monetary policy and strengthen the transmission mechanism.
13. The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. The tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until the inflation outlook displays a significant improvement and becomes consistent with the targets. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored, and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered."

Decision of the Monetary Policy Committee
Participating Committee Members
Murat Çetinkaya (Governor), Ömer Duman, Erkan Kilimci, Emrah Şener, Murat Uysal.
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to increase the policy rate (one week repo auction rate) from 16.5 percent to 17.75 percent.
Recently released data indicate a rebalancing trend in the economic activity. External demand maintains its strength, while domestic demand displays a more moderate course.
Cost factors have been the main driver of the recent upsurge in inflation. On the other hand, price increases have shown a generalized pattern across subsectors. Despite the mild outlook for demand conditions, elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations continue to pose risks on the pricing behavior. Accordingly, the Committee decided to further strengthen the monetary tightening to support price stability.
The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

14 June 2018
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 7 June 2018
Inflation Developments
1. In May, consumer prices rose by 1.62 percent and annual inflation increased by 1.30 points to 12.15 percent. The uptick in inflation spread across subgroups in this period. Persisting producer-price-driven cost pressures proved stronger relative to April. All in all, core indicators witnessed an increase in annual inflation, and their underlying trend maintained a high course.
2. Annual inflation in food and nonalcoholic beverages went up by 2.19 points to 11.00 percent in May. The uptick in the annual food inflation was led by the unprocessed food group, while the annual processed food inflation remained on a downward track. Seasonally adjusted unprocessed food prices recorded a notable increase, with items such as vegetables, potato, white and red meat and eggs in the lead. Price increases in processed food, which proved high across the first quarter, decelerated further in May as in April, and the group’s annual inflation receded to 13.42 percent.
3. Energy prices increased by 1.74 percent in May and annual energy inflation rose by 3.18 points to 15.17 percent, largely due to the low base effect accompanied by exchange rate developments and the course of oil prices. Owing to the tax arrangement in fuel products (re-arrangement of lump-sum special consumption tax amounts according to the changes in domestic refinery outlet prices due to the international oil prices or the exchange rate), it is expected that price increases in the energy group will lose pace, but the group’s annual inflation will remain on the rise in June.
4. In May, prices of services rose by 1.17 percent and annual services inflation inched up by 0.25 points to 9.52 percent, mostly due the to transport and restaurants-hotels groups. Inflation in transport services was pushed up by highway passenger transport, while the restaurants-hotels group saw rising prices in catering and accommodation services. These groups also reflected cost pressures led by the exchange rate as well as oil and food prices in addition to demand-side effects driven by the upbeat performance in tourism.
5. Annual core goods inflation rose by 0.52 points to 15.98 percent. Annual inflation declined somewhat in the clothing group, but picked up in other subgroups. The persisting upsurge in prices of durable goods continued in May, which was led by the prices of automobiles and white goods. In the other core goods group, prices posted increases due to the items with large import content such as housing maintenance and repair equipment and domestic cleaning products. In sum, cumulative deprecation in the Turkish lira stood out as the main driver of the rise in the core goods inflation in May.
6. The base effect and cost factors are likely to continue to exert upward pressure on annual inflation in June. Moreover, leading indicators signal that some subcategories of the unprocessed food group may register price hikes well above seasonal averages. Considered mostly temporary, this movement is monitored closely.
7. As a result, cost factors are the main driver of the upsurge in inflation. On the other hand, price increases marked a generalized pattern across subsectors. Despite the mild outlook for demand conditions, elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations continue to pose risks to the pricing behavior.
Factors Affecting Inflation
8. Data for the first quarter of 2018 suggest a maintained strength in economic activity. Although industrial production lost momentum in quarterly growth compared to previous quarters, its annual growth proved strong with 9.8 percent. In this period, sectors providing inetermediate inputs to the construction activity and sectors strongly affiliated to tourism supported industral production. The data reveal a mild course in sectoral activities other than industry as well. 
9. Domestic demand stood out as the main driver of quarterly growth in the first quarter. Private consumption remained on the rise, while investments, also supported by the public sector, were mainly contsruction oriented in the first quarter. Despite the sustained increase in gold imports, with the robust course in exports of goods excluding gold besides tourism revenues, net exports are expected to boost quarterly growth.
10. Recently released data indicate a rebalancing trend in the economic activity. Data for the second quarter indicate that external demand maintains its strength. Amid the favorable global growth outlook, rising external demand and flexibility in diversifying export markets continue to stimulate exports. The Committee noted that the rebound in tourism and transportation revenues remains rather brisk, and under these circumstances, net exports will provide positive contribution to quarterly growth in the second quarter as well. In the upcoming period, exports of goods and services are expected to boost growth further and the balancing in the domestic demand is likely to halt the upward trend in the current account deficit. However, soaring energy prices and gold imports hinder the improvement in the current account balance.
11. Domestic demand displays a more moderate course in the second quarter. Survey indicators point to a weaker consumer confidence as well as the trends of orders in firms especially producing for the domestic market. The current outlook signals for a domestic demand-driven slowdown, which is consistent with past projections that economic activity would converge to the uynderlying trend. In the close future, rising volatility in financial markets and perceptions of uncertainty, the depreciation in the Turkish lira and mounting financing costs may restrain domestic demand through investments. Meanwhile, accommodative fiscal measures are projected to moderate the slowdown in domestic demand.
12. In the first quarter, the maintained strength of economic activity supported the increase in employment and the decline in unemployment. Leading indicators signal that the balancing in economic activity in the period ahead may result in some deceleration in the labor market improvement.
13. In sum, recently released data indicate that economic activity remains strong in the first quarter, while it is converging to its underlying trend in the second quarter amid the balancing in domestic demand.
Monetary Policy and Risks
14. Current data on global economy point to stable and strong growth both in advanced and emerging economies. Data for the first quarter hint at an accelerated global growth compared to the previous quarter, and the prospects for the year end remain positive. Despite rising commodity and energy prices amid the solid growth outlook, consumer and core inflation rates are moderate across the globe.
15. Risks to the global growth outlook are more on the downside for the upcoming period. Major risks that can pose a drag on global growth include geopolitical tensions and the rising protectionist sentiment in international trade. Both the US government’s decision not to exempt EU member states from the additional customs tariffs on imported steel and aluminum and political uncertainty add to the downside risks to EU growth that slowed down in the first quarter of the year. The newly passed US tax reform is poised to provide a growth boost to the US and its trading partners, which is considered a major upside risk to global growth. 
16. After the March announcement on imposing additional customs tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, the US government lifted certain country exemptions from tariffs in early June, sparking possibly more protectionism in international trade across the world. In fact, impacted trading partners are poised to impose retaliatory tariffs that would spark more trade protectionism. The potential negative spillovers of such policies on global growth will depend on the size and form of the response of other trading partners.
17. An analysis of risks to global inflation reveals that geopolitical developments coupled with uncertainties regarding trade policies are likely to pose upside risks to commodity prices, especially to energy and metal prices. Moreover, in line with the falling unemployment rates in advanced economies, the possibility of wages to increase more rapidly than current trends is among major risk factors to push up inflation.
18. Financial conditions have recently tightened in advanced economies. The probability of an accelerated inflation due to brisk demand conditions and rising commodity prices constitutes a risk of triggering a faster-than-projected tightening in monetary policies across these countries. US bond returns have been on the rise since mid-April as the Federal Reserve (the Fed) hints at three policy rate hikes in the remainder of 2018. Amid the appreciation of the US dollar, global financial markets have recently witnessed fluctuations, the risk sentiment towards emerging economies has deteriorated, exchange rates saw depreciation and increased volatility and portfolio flows lost momentum.
19. Fluctuating global financial markets have a tightening effect on domestic financial conditions, which led to a higher risk premium, slower portfolio flows, a weaker and more volatile Turkish lira and higher market and loan rates. Geopolitical developments and the outlook for macro indicators such as inflation and the current account deficit made Turkey more sensitive to global fluctuations. Due to higher risk premium and reduced portfolio flows, the Turkish lira faced more depreciation and volatility compared to other emerging market currencies. On the credit market front, the loan boost created by the CGF support of 2017 has largely subsided and in addition to commercial loans, there has been a balancing in consumer loans, especially in housing loans. Hence, both external and domestic developments suggest that financial conditions will remain tight over the upcoming period. 
20. After a robust first quarter, economic activity started to converge to its underlying trend in the second quarter. The uncertainty over monetary policies across advanced economies and geopolitical tensions feed into downside risks to economic activity. The recent financial market volatility and the mounting uncertainty pose downside risks to domestic demand and the growth outlook, particularly via investment spending. The tighter monetary policy stance is likely to decrease financial volatility and contain downside risks to growth. On the other hand, the strong tourism rebound, the upbeat global growth outlook and accommodative real exchange rates are expected to provide further positive contribution to the growth composition and the current account balance. The Committee emphasized that the steps toward tighter monetary policy should be accompanied by an enhanced macro policy coordination to ensure a modest rebalancing of the economy.
21. High inflation and rising inflation expectations keep risks to pricing behavior alive. Although aggregate demand conditions are likely to have a steadily waning effect on inflation, the significant cost pressures from the recent Turkish lira depreciation and their potential second-round effects weigh on the inflation outlook. According to diffusion indices, economic agents are much more inclined to raise prices. The inertia in the indicators for underlying inflation trends and the high levels of core inflation continue to pose risks to pricing behavior. In addition, the recent increases in import prices, particularly for oil, add to these risks.
22. Thus, considering the effects of unhealthy pricing and excessive volatilities across markets on the inflation outlook, the Central Bank introduced some adjustments for the foreign exchange market since the interim meeting on 23 May. These adjustments aim at controlled and efficient provision of the liquidity required by the market in times of excessive volatility. Accordingly, on 24 May 2018, the Bank announced an update to the calendar for Turkish lira-settled forward foreign exchange sale auctions to be held in the second quarter of 2018, thus raising the amount of forward foreign exchange sale position from 7.1 billion USD to 8 billion USD. Moreover, the upper limit for the total amount of forward foreign exchange sale position was determined to be USD 10 billion until end-2018. Additionally, on 25 May 2018, the Bank decided to allow repayments of rediscount credits for export and foreign exchange earning services to be made in Turkish liras at a fixed exchange rate.
23. Furthermore, on 28 May 2018, the Committee announced its decision to complete the simplification process regarding the operational framework of monetary policy. Accordingly, the one-week repo rate will be the main policy rate of the Central Bank. This rate is set equal to the late liquidity window lending rate in effect on the date of meeting. In addition, the Central Bank overnight borrowing and lending rates are determined at 150 basis points below/above the one-week repo rate. Thus, the overnight borrowing and lending rates will form a symmetrical corridor around the one-week repo auction rate, keeping market rates from deviating significantly from the weekly repo auction rate. The new operational framework that took effect on 1 June 2018 is expected to enhance the predictability of monetary policy and strengthen the transmission mechanism. 
24. With the strong policy response at the interim meeting on 23 May 2018 and the simplified operational framework, the Committee has partially restrained the domestic financial market volatility. Nevertheless, the current elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations continue to pose risks on pricing behavior. Accordingly, the Committee decided to further strengthen the monetary tightening in June to support price stability and raised the policy rate (one week repo auction rate) from 16.5 percent to 17.75 percent.
25. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.
26. Public finance has been providing more support to disinflation, which confirms the stronger coordination between monetary and fiscal policies. The joint efforts to transform policy coordination into a continuous and systematic framework will contribute to disinflation in 2018 as well.
27. Developments in fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices and taxes. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
28. In recent years, sustaining fiscal discipline has been one of the key factors in lowering the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks. The room provided by fiscal discipline facilitated the implementation of an expansionary fiscal policy. Structural measures to provide room for counter-cyclical fiscal policies will enhance the coordination of monetary and fiscal policy, and improve macroeconomic stability. Moreover, sustaining structural steps to reduce inertia and volatility in inflation will contribute positively to the price stability and social welfare."

Press Release on the Maximum Interest Rates for Credit Cards in Q3 2018
The monthly maximum contractual interest rate for the credit card borrowings has been revised as 2.02 percent for the Turkish lira and 1.62 percent for foreign exchange transactions, whereas the monthly maximum overdue interest rate will be 2.52 percent for the Turkish lira and 2.12 percent for foreign exchange transactions, to be effective from 1 July 2018.
Banks in Turkey, as is the case in other countries, charge higher interest rates for credit card borrowing than they do for consumer loans. The CBRT, therefore, advises credit card holders with short-term credit needs to seek a consumer loan rather than borrowing on personal credit cards.

Decision of the Monetary Policy Committee
Participating Committee Members
Murat Çetinkaya (Governor), Ömer Duman, Erkan Kilimci, Emrah Şener, Murat Uysal, Abdullah Yavaş.
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the policy rate (one week repo auction rate) constant at 17.75 percent.
Recently released data indicate a more significant rebalancing trend in the economic activity. External demand maintains its strength, while signs of decelaration in domestic demand become more visible.
Cost factors and volatility in food prices have been the main drivers of the recent upsurge in inflation. On the other hand, price increases have shown a generalized pattern across subsectors. Despite the milder impact of demand conditions on inflation, elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations continue to pose risks on the pricing behavior. Accordingly, the Committee assessed that it might be necessary to maintain a tight monetary stance for an extended period.
The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior, lagged impact of recent monetary policy decisions, contribution of fiscal policy to rebalancing process, and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

2018,31 July 2018,Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting,"No: 2018-29
31 July 2018
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 24 July 2018
Inflation Developments
1. In June, consumer prices rose by 2.61 percent and annual inflation increased by 3.24 points to 15.39 percent. The rise in annual inflation was widespread across subcategories, with the most significant contribution coming from unprocessed food. Cost pressures from recent exchange rate developments drove prices higher in many related items. Producer prices exerted even stronger upward pressure on consumer prices compared to a month earlier. Thus, core indicators saw a notable increase in both their annual inflation rates and underlying trends.

2. Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 7.89 points to 18.89 percent in June. This increase was driven by the unprocessed food inflation that soared due to vegetables prices. In this period, there was significant divergence between the producer prices for PPI for agriculture and the consumer prices for food. The widening gap between producer and consumer price levels for some vegetables signaled market problems associated with the distribution channel. Meanwhile, processed food prices recorded increases across all subcategories, pushing annual processed food inflation up to 14.47 percent. In the upcoming period, bread and raw milk reference purchase prices might put upward pressure on processed food prices.

3. Energy prices increased by 1.01 percent in June and annual energy inflation rose by 1.82 points to 16.99 percent. Solid fuel, bottled gas and administered municipal water prices were up, whereas fuel prices remained flat due to the new sliding-scale tariff system. In the period ahead, administered energy prices will likely reflect the cumulative cost pressures from exchange rates and oil prices.

4. In June, annual services inflation increased by 1.44 points to 10.96 percent. The rise in services inflation was widespread across subcategories. Communication services inflation went up on the back of internet tariffs, while transport services inflation was driven higher by cumulative cost pressures and the buoyant domestic and international tourism industry. The tourism upsurge was the main driver of price hikes in related subcategories, such as catering, accommodation and package tours. In summary, prices of services reflected not only cost pressures from exchange rates, oil prices and food prices but also demand-side effects of the favorable tourism outlook.

5. Annual core goods inflation rose by 2.57 points to 18.55 percent in June, largely due to recent exchange rate developments. Thus, prices of durable goods and other core goods posted sharp widespread increases. Clothing inflation, however, remained flat in this period. The exchange rate-driven rise in costs is likely to put further inflationary pressure on prices of core goods in coming months.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6. Economic activity proved a little stronger than projected in the first quarter of 2018. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased by 2.0 percent on a quarterly basis and 7.4 percent on an annual basis. Main driver of quarterly growth was domestic demand, particularly private consumption in the first quarter. Investment offered rather limited support to growth due to the muted course of machinery-equipment investments. Net exports contributed positively to quarterly growth owing both to the contraction in imports coupled with the rebound in tourism.

7. Recently released data indicate a more significant rebalancing trend in economic activity. Data for the second quarter reveal that external demand maintains its strength. Amid favorable global growth outlook, rising external demand and flexibility in diversifying export markets continue to stimulate exports. The Committee noted that the rebound in revenues from tourism and other services is rather brisk, and under these circumstances, net exports will provide positive contribution to quarterly growth in the second quarter as well. In the upcoming period, exports of goods and services are expected to boost growth further and the slowdown in import demand resulting from the subdued domestic demand is likely to have further positive repercussions on the current account balance.

8. In the second quarter, signs of deceleration in domestic demand became more visible. In this period, the depreciation in the Turkish lira accompanied by the increased financial volatility, perceptions of uncertainty and financing costs decelerated domestic demand both through the consumption and investment expenditures channels. The slowdown in domestically-oriented sectors, particularly sectors affiliated to construction, confirms this outlook. Meanwhile, accommodative stance of the public sector conducted through expenditures and fiscal measures are projected to moderate the slowdown in domestic demand to some extent. Survey indicators point that the rebalancing process in economic activity may continue in the third quarter.

9. The ongoing improvement in the labor market came to halt in the second quarter, as the economic activity started to lose pace and converge to its underlying trend. Employment in the services and industrial sectors posted mild increases in April, while the evident fall in construction employment led to a quarterly decline in non-farm employment.

10. In sum, data for the second quarter indicate that economic activity has assumed a rebalancing process both in terms of growth rate and composition. However, the downside risks to the magnitude and duration of the slowdown in economic activity are kept alive by the high level of financial volatility and perceptions of uncertainty.
Monetary Policy and Risks
11. The Committee evaluated the medium-term inflation forecasts for the July Inflation Report as well. Accordingly, year-end consumer inflation forecasts for 2018 and 2019 were revised upwards by 5 points and 2.8 points, respectively compared to the April forecast. With a tight policy stance that focuses on bringing inflation down with enhanced policy coordination, inflation is projected to converge gradually to the target. Accordingly, inflation is projected to be 13.4 percent at the end of 2018 and then fall to 9.3 percent at the end of 2019, 6.7 percent at the end of 2020, stabilizing around 5 percent over the medium term. Forecasts are based on a monetary policy framework that envisaged that the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained for an extended period.

12. Cost factors and volatility in food prices have been the main drivers of the recent upsurge in inflation. On the other hand, price increases have shown a generalized pattern across subsectors. Despite the milder impact of demand conditions on inflation, elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations continue to pose risks on the pricing behavior. Accordingly, the Committee assessed that it might be necessary to maintain a tight monetary stance for an extended period.

13. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior, lagged impact of recent monetary policy decisions, contribution of fiscal policy to rebalancing process, and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.

14. The outlook that the medium-term projections presented in the Inflation Report is based on the Monetary Policy Committee's judgments and assumptions. Nevertheless, various risks to these factors may affect the inflation outlook and necessitate changes in the monetary policy stance envisaged in the baseline scenario. The Committee evaluated that risks to the medium-term inflation outlook are mostly on the upside.

15. The pricing behavior, developments in global risk appetite, the contribution of fiscal policy to the rebalancing, and the lagged effects of the monetary policy will be monitored closely in the coming period. Should these factors deviate from the baseline scenario, the monetary policy stance will be reviewed depending on the change in the inflation outlook."

Press Release on Financial Markets
To support financial stability and sustain the effective functioning of markets, the following measures have been introduced:
I. Turkish lira liquidity management:
1) In the framework of intraday and overnight standing facilities, the Central Bank will provide all the liquidity the banks need.
2) Discount rates for collaterals against Turkish lira transactions will be revised based on type and maturity, thus providing banks with flexibility in their collateral management. Through this regulation, the discounted value of banks’ current unencumbered collaterals is projected to increase by approximately 3,8 billion Turkish liras.
3) Collateral FX deposit limits for Turkish lira transactions of banks have been raised to 20 billion euros from 7,2 billion euros.
4) As cited in the Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy Text for 2018, when deemed necessary, in addition to one-week repo auctions, which are the main funding instrument of the Central Bank, traditional repo auctions or deposit selling auctions may be held with maturities no longer than 91 days.
5) For the days with relatively higher funding need, more than one repo auction may be conducted with maturities between 6 and 10 days.
6) To provide flexibility in banks’ collateral management, upon the request of banks, a portion of or the entire amount of the winning bids in one-week repo auctions will be allowed to be used in deposit transactions instead of repo transactions at the Central Bank Interbank Money Market with the same interest rate and maturity.   
 
II. FX liquidity management:
1) Banks will be able to borrow FX deposits in one-month maturity in addition to one-week maturity.
2) The Central Bank will resume its intermediary function at the FX deposit market. Accordingly, through the intermediation of the Central Bank, banks will be able to borrow from and lend to each other at the FX deposit market as per the rules set by the Implementation Instructions on the Foreign Exchange and Banknotes Markets.
3) Banks’ current foreign exchange deposit limits of around 50 billion US dollars may be increased and utilization conditions may be improved if deemed necessary.
4) Banks will continue to purchase foreign banknotes from the Central Bank via foreign exchange transactions within their pre-determined limits at the Foreign Exchange and Banknotes Markets.
The Central Bank will closely monitor the market depth and price formations, and take all necessary measures to maintain financial stability, if deemed necessary.

The monthly maximum contractual interest rate for the credit card borrowings has been revised as 2.25 percent for the Turkish lira and 1.80 percent for foreign exchange transactions, whereas the monthly maximum overdue interest rate will be 2.75 percent for the Turkish lira and 2.30 percent for foreign exchange transactions, to be effective from 1 October 2018.
Banks in Turkey, as is the case in other countries, charge higher interest rates for credit card borrowing than they do for consumer loans. The CBRT, therefore, advises credit card holders with short-term credit needs to seek a consumer loan rather than borrowing on personal credit cards.

Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 13 September 2018
Inflation Developments
1- In August, consumer prices rose by 2.30 percent and annual inflation increased by 2.05 points to 17.90 percent. The rise in annual inflation was widespread across subcategories, with the most significant contribution coming from core goods and energy groups due to exchange rate developments. In the recent period, cost pressures have elevated, economic units’ tendency to raise prices has become stronger.
2- Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 0.35 points to 19.75 percent in August. In this period, seasonally adjusted unprocessed food prices remained almost flat. Meanwhile, processed food prices increased by 2.12 percent in August, mainly due to exchange rates and developments in the prices of products used as input for processed food.
3- In August, energy prices increased by 5.37 percent and annual inflation in this group increased by 3.85 points to 21.34 percent. The rise was mainly driven by increments in electricity and natural gas prices as well as increased fuel oil prices due to Special Consumption Tax (SCT) arrangements.
4- Annual core goods inflation rose by 3.60 points to 23.18 percent in August. The durable goods and other core goods prices continued to increase across subcategories due to exchange rate developments. Prices of durable consumption goods increased by 5.49 percent. The seasonal sales in clothing group remained limited compared to previous years. 
5- Annual services inflation increased by 0.80 points to 11.84 percent. Transportation services inflation went up on the back of rapid rises in tourism and fuel-oil prices. Meanwhile, the uptrend in accommodation services continued due to exchange rate developments and robust tourism activities.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6- In the second quarter of 2018, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased by 0.9 percent quarterly and by 5.2 percent annually. Thus, economic activity slowed down to converge to its underlying trend and rebalanced in terms of its composition. In the second quarter, the main driver of the quarterly growth was net exports backed by the recovery in tourism. 
7- Recently released data indicate a more significant rebalancing trend in the economic activity. According to the third quarter data, external demand maintains its strength. Amid a stable global growth outlook, rising external demand and flexibility in diversifying export markets continue to stimulate exports. The Committee noted that the recovery in revenues from tourism and other services is rather strong, and under these circumstances, the positive contribution of net exports to quarterly growth may increase also in the third quarter. In the upcoming period, exports of goods and services are expected to boost growth further and the slowdown in import demand resulting from the subdued domestic demand is likely to maintain its positive impact on the current account balance.
Monetary Policy and Risks
8- Data on global economy indicate that growth has stabilized and remained strong, offering a positive outlook for the  year end. Despite the rise in commodity and energy prices due to positive global growth, consumer and core inflation rates continue to follow a moderate course worldwide. Downside risks to the global growth outlook are assessed to be more evident in the upcoming period. Geopolitical developments and increased discourse of protectionism in foreign trade stand out as the main risk factors that may deteriorate  the global growth outlook.
9- An assessment of global inflation risks reveals that geopolitical developments and uncertainties about foreign trade policies may pose an upward risk to commodity prices, particularly energy and metal prices. Moreover, the likelihood of an acceleration in wages in advanced economies due to falling unemployment rates is also one of the most important risk factors for inflation in these countries.
10- Financial conditions in advanced economies have tightened in the recent period. The probability of acceleration in inflation due to strong demand and the rise in commodity prices creates a risk that may trigger a faster-than-expected tightening in the monetary policies of these economies. In particular, the ongoing positive growth performance and the new tax law in the US that can be seen as an expansionary fiscal policy increases the probability of Fed to expedite the monetary policy normalization process.
11- In sum, geopolitical uncertainties, weakening capital flows towards emerging economies, and the expansion of protectionism discourse in foreign trade continue to affect the outlook in emerging economies.
12- In this period of high volatility in financial markets, cost pressures and their second-round effects have negatively affected the inflation outlook. Accordingly, the Committee has delivered a strong monetary tightening in September to support price stability and raised the policy rate (the one-week repo auction rate) to 24 percent from 17.75 percent. It has also announced that the Central Bank funding, which used to be provided through overnight lending, will be provided via one-week repo auctions.   
13- The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. The tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until the inflation outlook displays a significant improvement. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior, lagged impact of recent monetary policy decisions, contribution of fiscal policy to the rebalancing process, and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.
14- The enhanced coordination between monetary policy and fiscal policy is believed to play an important role in disinflation efforts and macroeconomic rebalancing. Moreover, continued structural steps focusing on reducing rigidity and volatility in inflation will contribute to price stability and social welfare."

Decision of the Monetary Policy Committee
Participating Committee Members
Murat Çetinkaya (Governor), Ömer Duman, Uğur Namık Küçük, Emrah Şener, Murat Uysal, Abdullah Yavaş.
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the policy rate (one week repo auction rate) constant at 24 percent.
Recently released data show that rebalancing trend in the economy has become more noticeable. External demand maintains its strength while slowdown in economic activity continues, partly due to tighter financial conditions.
Recent developments regarding the inflation outlook point to significant risks to price stability. Price increases have shown a generalized pattern across subsectors, reflecting the movements in exchange rates. Although weaker domestic demand conditions will partially mitigate the deterioration in the inflation outlook, upside risks on the pricing behavior continue to prevail. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance.
The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior, lagged impact of recent monetary policy decisions, contribution of fiscal policy to rebalancing process, and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.

31 October 2018
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 25 October 2018
Inflation Developments
1- In September, consumer prices rose by 6.30 percent and annual inflation increased by 6.62 points to 24.52 percent. Price increases spread across subcategories in this period. Effects of exchange rate developments were apparent in many items, particularly on core goods, while items with relatively low exchange rate pass-through also recorded noticeable price hikes. Elevated exchange rate volatility weighed on inflation uncertainty, while backward-indexation in inflation trended upwards and exchange rate pass-through to consumer inflation remained strong, which resulted in a notable deterioration in the pricing behavior. Although aggregate demand conditions started to support disinflation, the course of consumer inflation was mostly shaped by the elevated producer inflation-driven cost pressures. Against this background, both the annual inflation and the underlying trend of core indicators recorded a sharp increase.
2- Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 7.95 points to 27.70 percent in September. This period was marked by accelerated tendency for price hikes both in processed and unprocessed food items, and all subcategories witnessed price increases. Leading indicators for October point out that food inflation is yet to increase.
3- In September, energy prices increased by 6.05 percent and annual inflation in this group rose by 5.69 points to 27.03 percent. This rise was mainly driven by price adjustments in electricity and natural gas as well as increased fuel oil prices due to the lingering effect of Special Consumption Tax (SCT) arrangements in August. Oil prices trended upwards in this period, but the continued sliding-scale tariff restricted the possible upside risks to inflation. The rise in energy inflation is likely to move further upwards in October due to the price adjustments in electricity and natural gas.
4- Annual core goods inflation rose by 11.94 points to 35.12 percent in September. This rise was led by the sharp depreciation in the Turkish lira, and prices increased across all subcategories. Considerable price increases were seen particularly in durable goods with high imported content (12.93 percent) and other core goods (11.22 percent). Moreover, the clothing group registered price hikes above seasonal norms. Core goods inflation is expected to follow a favorable course in October particularly due to durable goods supported by the recent appreciation in the Turkish lira coupled with the SCT base arrangement in automobiles. In addition the All-Out War on Inflation Program is also considered to underpin the downtrend in inflation in the short term.
5- Annual services inflation increased by 2.13 points to 13.97 percent month-on-month. The rise in the restaurants-hotels and transportation services inflation went up due to the cost-side factors led by food and fuel oil prices as well as the brisk outlook in tourism. Meanwhile, the uptrend in other services inflation is attributed to the reverberations of exchange rate developments accompanied by the price hikes in education services driven by the high levels of headline inflation.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6- Recently released data show that the rebalancing trend in the economy has become more noticeable. Composite indicators of domestic demand signal a notable deceleration both in private consumption and investment expenditures, while the central government budget data show that the public expenditures’ direct support to growth recorded a decline compared to the previous period.  External demand maintains its strength in contrast to slowing domestic demand. Amid a stable global growth outlook, rising external demand and flexibility in diversifying export markets continue to stimulate exports. The Committee noted that the brisk course of revenues from tourism and other services notably boosted the contribution of net exports to quarterly growth in the third quarter. In the upcoming period, exports of goods and services are expected to boost growth further and the slowdown in import demand resulting from the subdued domestic demand is likely to maintain its positive effect on the current account balance.
7- The slowdown in economic activity continues, partly due to tighter financial conditions. Survey indicators for the last quarter show that the downtrend in the capacity utilization rate of the manufacturing industry continues across all subcategories. The deceleration in the indicators for production and orders of domestic market-oriented sectors, particularly sectors affiliated to construction, confirms this outlook. Prospects for exports and tourism-linked activities seem relatively better, yet the stance for employment and investment has recorded an overall worsening.
8- The labor market data confirmed the evaluations that the economy lost pace in the third quarter due to the domestic demand. Sectors affiliated to foreign trade and government offered positive contributions to the services employment. However, the fall in construction employment continued and the industrial employment registered a decline compared to the previous period. Leading indicators signal a sustained increase in unemployment rates.
9- Credit conditions have remained to be tight in the third quarter. In addition, the propensity to save in public expenditures coupled with the rise in unemployment rates hint at a further deceleration in domestic demand. Net exports are likely to boost growth further in the last quarter and curb the slowdown in economic activity to some extent.
10- In sum, recently released data for the third quarter and the leading indicators for the last quarter point that the real adjustment in the economy continues with full speed and the rebalancing trend has become more pronounced. Lingering tight financial conditions maintain the downside risks to the magnitude and duration of the slowdown in economic activity.
Monetary Policy and Risks
11- The Committee evaluated the medium-term inflation forecasts for the October Inflation Report as well. Accordingly, compared to the July forecast, year-end consumer inflation forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have been revised upwards by 10.1 points and 5.9 points, respectively. Under a tight policy stance focusing on bringing inflation down accompanied by reinforced policy coordination, inflation is projected to converge gradually to the targets. In this respect, inflation is projected to be 23.5 percent at end-2018, and then fall to 15.2 percent at end-2019 and 9.3 percent at end-2020 before stabilizing around 5 percent in the medium term. Forecasts are based on a monetary policy framework that envisages that the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained for an extended period.
12- Recent developments regarding the inflation outlook point to significant risks to price stability. Price increases have shown a generalized pattern across subsectors, reflecting the movements in exchange rates. Although weaker domestic demand conditions will partially mitigate the deterioration in the inflation outlook, upside risks to the pricing behavior continue to prevail. The significant increase in producer prices-driven cost-side pressures,  and the elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations continue to pose risks to the inflation outlook in the coming period. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance and keep the policy rate (one week repo auction rate) constant at 24 percent.
13- The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. The tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until the inflation outlook displays a significant improvement. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior, lagged impact of recent monetary policy decisions, contribution of fiscal policy to the rebalancing process, and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.
14- The outlook that the medium-term projections presented in the Inflation Report are based on is shaped by the Monetary Policy Committee's judgments and assumptions. Nevertheless, various risks to these factors may affect the inflation outlook and necessitate changes in the monetary policy stance envisaged in the baseline scenario. The Committee noted that risks to the medium-term inflation outlook are mostly on the upside.
15- The primary risk to inflation outlook in the upcoming period would be a further deterioration in pricing behavior. In recent months, the exchange rate pass-through to the consumer inflation has firmed, backward indexation has become more widespread, and pricing behavior has deteriorated considerably. Although it is believed that exchange rate-related inflationary pressures will remain relatively subdued under current circumstances, risks to the inflation outlook remain solid amid highly volatile exchange rates. In case of a failure in implementing the macroeconomic rebalancing process rapidly and effectively enough to bring inflation down amid high inflation rates and risk premium levels, inflation and exchange rate expectations may feed each other and undermine the disinflation process. In such a case, any further deterioration in pricing behavior may necessitate a tighter-than-envisaged monetary policy stance for a longer time in order to lower inflation.
16- Crude oil prices and domestic food prices are also considered to constitute upside risks to inflation in the upcoming period. Although problems in the US regarding the supply of shale oil have been largely settled in the recent period, the supply shortage due to geopolitical developments in Iran and Venezuela continues to be the major upside risk to crude oil prices. On the other hand, increased protectionism in global trade stands out as a downward risk factor for commodity prices due to its likely adverse effect on global growth. Risks related to domestic food prices are projected to be on the upside because of cumulative cost-side pressures, particularly in the short term. In this framework, the monetary policy response will be determined in such a way to curb a possible deterioration in inflation expectations and pricing behavior, taking into account the direct and secondary effects of respective risks on inflation.
17- The deteriorated pricing behavior, tight financial conditions and the financial state of the corporate sector have recently caused inflation dynamics to change and the uncertainty over inflation and forecasts to rise. The cumulative cost pressures on firms and the decrease in their profitability, coupled with increased working capital costs and the backward indexation behaviour in wages, may cause the disinflationary impact of the demand channel to be more limited compared to the implications of the historical data. In the short-run, monetary policy decisions will be more sensitive to incoming data and the monetary policy stance will be revised upon detection of changes in the inflation outlook.
18- In the third quarter of the year, credit conditions recorded a significantly higher tightening than historical averages due to incresing risk premiums. The rate and extent of the normalization to be observed in credit conditions in the upcoming period are important in terms of the outlook of economic activity. As cash flows and balance sheets of firms have been adversely affected by the increase in exchange rates and loan rates as well as by the slowdown in economic activity, conducting the necessary assessments and analyses related to the asset quality of firms will have a decisive role in the credit market. Therefore, establishing a coordination between the financial sector policies that restrict the balance sheet effects of the corporate sector and the monetary policy that focuses on inflation has become crucial for preventing the financial conditions from falling into an unproductive tightening cycle.
19- There are also risks stemming from global monetary policies and risk appetite developments that may lead to a decline in capital flows towards emerging economies and feed into exchange rate volatility. The sustained monetary tightening trend and the increase in bond yields in advanced economies, heightened protectionism in global trade, Brexit developments, concerns over the budget deficit and sovereign debt of Italy, and imminent sanctions on Iran may cause the risk appetite for emerging economies to display a fluctuating pattern in the upcoming period. This, in turn, may pose a downside risk to portfolio flows to emerging economies. In case of excessive market volatility due to fluctuations in global liquidity conditions and in perceptions of risk, the CBRT may use liquidity measures intended for providing the market with the needed FX liquidity in a timely, controlled and effective manner. In addition, it may introduce additional tightening in monetary policy to curb the impact of these risks on inflation and inflation expectations.
20- The coordination between the monetary policy and the fiscal policy is very crucial with respect to disinflation and macroeconomic rebalancing. The fiscal policy outlook that the medium-term projections in the Inflation Report are based on incorporates a policy stance that focuses on disinflation and macroeconomic rebalancing and that is coordinated with the monetary policy, which is in line with the New Economy Program announced in September. Accordingly, the projections rest on an outlook where the fiscal policy introduces a tight fiscal discipline, as envisaged in the New Economy Program. Moreover, it is assumed that administered prices, tax and wage adjustments will be formulated in a way that will help reduce the backward-indexation behavior. If the fiscal policy significantly deviates from this framework leading to an adverse impact on the medium-term inflation outlook, the monetary policy stance may be revised.
21- Collective efforts to turn the recently enhanced coordination between monetary and fiscal policies into a sustained and systematic structure are expected to support the fight against inflation. Moreover, continued structural steps focusing on reducing rigidity and volatility in inflation will contribute to price stability and social welfare."

20 December 2018
Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting
Meeting Date: 13 December 2018
 
Inflation Developments
1. In November, consumer prices dropped by 1.44% and annual inflation decreased by 3.62 points to 21.62%. Annual inflation registered a decline across all subcategories. The fall in core goods inflation was mainly led by temporary tax cuts applied to durable goods. In this period, energy prices dropped due to the fall in oil prices and the appreciation in the Turkish lira. Against this background, annual inflation and the underlying trend in core indicators both decelerated. In sum, consumer prices in November reflect tax cuts, the appreciation in the Turkish lira, and falling oil prices as well as demand-side effects led by weaker economic activity. 
2. Annual inflation in food and nonalcoholic beverages went down by 3.60 points to 25.66% in November. This decline was mostly driven by the fall in unprocessed food prices led by fresh fruits and vegetables. On the processed food front, after following a high course for a while, price increases lost pace in this period.
 
3. Energy prices were down by 0.71% and annual inflation in this group fell by 4.08 points to 25.35%. This is attributed to falling international oil prices and the appreciation in Turkish lira. Leading indicators for December indicate that the support from fuel prices to consumer inflation continues at a strong pace. 
4. Annual core goods inflation fell by 7.46 points to 26.89% in November owing mainly to the prices of durable goods that dropped on the back of temporary tax cuts and the high reflections of these discounts on prices in past months. The rate of increase in clothing prices remained significantly below periodic price increases of past years. Meanwhile, lagged effects of the exchange rate on other core goods persisted, albeit in a weaker manner. All in all, the decline in core goods inflation in November is largely attributed to temporary tax cuts, while appreciation in the Turkish lira and weaker domestic demand emerged as other factors to support the slowdown in inflation.
 
5. The annual services inflation fell by 0.09 points to 14.67%. Annual inflation declined in rents and transport services, but remained almost flat in communication, restaurants-hotels and other services groups. Cost-side factors led by food and fuel prices had a positive effect on the catering and transportation services inflation. Meanwhile, weakening domestic demand supported the overall slowdown in services inflation.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6. In the third quarter, Turkey’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contracted by 1.1% quarter-on-quarter but grew by 1.6% at an annual basis. The economic slowdown was driven by domestic demand, with both consumption and investment expenditures down from the previous quarter. Public consumption was another drag on quarterly growth. As a result of the domestic demand-led sharp drop in imports coupled with robust exports of goods and strong tourism demand, net exports made an increased contribution to quarterly and annual growth and prevented the economy from contracting further. 
7. Recently released data show that the rebalancing trend in the economy has become more noticeable. Economic activity continues to slow amid weaker domestic demand. In addition, with the rapid rise in inflation, real incomes fall and weigh on domestic demand. The outlook for export and tourism-related activities remains relatively stable, but employment and investment weaken across sectors. 
 
8. Despite recent signs of some slowdown in global growth, external demand maintains its strength. Firms’ orientation towards external markets amid sluggish domestic demand and their flexibility in market diversification stimulate exports of goods; and external balances continue to improve rapidly on brisk tourism demand. On the other hand, imports remain on a downward slide, largely due to consumption and investment goods, which led to historically high current account surplus in August – October period. The rapid improvement in current account balance is expected to continue in the period ahead.  Accordingly, net exports are expected to contribute further to growth in the fourth quarter and limit the economic slowdown to some extent. The Committee noted that exports of goods and services will continue to spur growth in the coming months and the falling import demand reflecting weak domestic demand will continue to have a positive effect on the current account balance. 
9. Labor market data confirm that the economy continues to slow on the back of domestic demand. In the third quarter, construction employment declined while the public sector and business activities across services and industrial sectors with relatively stronger external trade links continued to make a positive contribution to employment.
 
Monetary Policy and Risks
10. Global economic activity remained positive from the perspective of external demand, yet decelerated slightly. Increasing protectionist trends in foreign trade increased the uncertainty over global economic policies and highlighted downside risks to the global growth outlook for the upcoming period. The slowdown in the global economic activity was mostly driven by advanced economies, led by the euro area.  Forecasts for 2019 also point that the global growth outlook weakened slightly compared to the previous period, mainly due to the weak foreign trade. Additionally, developments related to the Brexit keep uncertainties over both the economic activity and financial markets in the euro area alive.
 
11. Despite the weakening global economic activity, global inflation has risen due to both advanced and emerging economies. This rise is mainly attributable to energy prices led by oil prices, which generally hovered at high levels throughout the first three quarters of 2018. In the recent period, oil prices have decreased notably driven by both supply and demand factors. This decline is expected to exert downward pressure on the inflation of both advanced and emerging economies. On the wages front, the unemployment rates, which are at historically low levels in some advanced economies, remain to be a wages driven upside risk factor for global inflation.
12. The normalization expectations regarding the monetary policy of advanced economies is more moderate compared to the previous period, mainly due to the relative weakening of global growth outlook and the decline in oil prices. Although this outlook implies more favorable conditions in terms of portfolio flows to emerging economies, increased uncertainties over global economic policies may affect risk appetite adversely, thereby posing downside risks to portfolio flows.  
 
13. While developments in import prices and domestic demand conditions have led to some improvement in the inflation outlook, risks to price stability continue to prevail. Elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations, and uncertainties over the course of cost factors continue to pose risks to the pricing behavior in the coming period. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance until the inflation outlook displays a significant improvement and kept the policy rate (one week repo auction rate) constant at 24%.
14. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior, lagged impact of recent monetary policy decisions, contribution of fiscal policy to the rebalancing process, and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.
 
15. The fiscal policy outlook that the monetary policy is based on incorporates a policy stance that focuses on price stability and macroeconomic rebalancing and that is coordinated with the monetary policy. Accordingly, the monetary policy stance assumes that administered price, tax and wage adjustments are formulated in a way that will help reducing the backward indexation behavior.  If the fiscal policy significantly deviates from this framework leading to an adverse impact on the medium-term inflation outlook, the monetary policy stance may be revised.
16. Collective efforts to turn the recently enhanced coordination between monetary and fiscal policies into a sustained and systematic structure are expected to support the achievement of price stability. Moreover, continued structural steps focusing on reducing rigidity and volatility in inflation will contribute to price stability and therefore social welfare."

The monthly maximum interest rates that banks can charge on credit card borrowing in the first quarter of 2019 have been left unchanged.
Banks in Turkey, as is the case in other countries, charge higher interest rates for credit card borrowing than they do for consumer loans. The CBRT, therefore, advises credit card holders with short-term credit needs to seek a consumer loan rather than borrowing on personal credit cards.

DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Participating Committee Members
Murat Çetinkaya (Governor), Ahmet Faruk Aysan, Erkan Kilimci, Emrah Şener, Murat Uysal, Abdullah Yavaş.
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates at the following levels:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been increased from 8.5 percent to 9.25 percent and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.25 percent.
b) One-week repo rate has been kept at 8 percent,
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been increased from 10 percent to 11 percent.
Recently released data indicate a partial recovery in the economic activity. Demand from the European Union economies continues to contribute positively to exports, while domestic demand displays a weaker course. With the supportive measures and incentives provided recently, the recovery in the economic activity is expected to continue at a moderate pace. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly.
Aggregate demand developments support disinflation. Yet, excessive fluctuations in exchange rates since the previous meeting have increased the upside risks regarding the inflation outlook. The significant rise in inflation is expected to continue in the short term due to lagged pass-through effects and the volatility in food prices. Accordingly, the Committee decided to strengthen the monetary tightening in order to contain the deterioration in the inflation outlook.  
The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered. Moreover, necessary liquidity measures will be taken in case of unhealthy pricing behavior in the foreign exchange market that cannot be justified by economic fundamentals.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

2017,31 January 2017,SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING,"No: 2017-07
31 January 2017
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING 
Meeting Date: 24 January 2017
Inflation Developments
1.    In December, consumer prices were up 1.64 percent, while annual inflation rose by 1.53 points to 8.53 percent. As stated in December’s Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting, annual food inflation soared amid higher unprocessed food prices, while energy inflation continued to climb due to the outlook for exchange rates and oil prices. In addition, recent tax adjustments, particularly on tobacco, put a marked upward pressure on inflation. Moreover, the plunging Turkish lira drove the annual inflation and underlying trend of core indicators higher.
2.    Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages surged by 2.10 points to 5.65 percent, largely due to unprocessed food prices rising amid adverse weather conditions and exchange rate developments. Annual processed food inflation remained virtually flat. Leading indicators for January signal a continued uptrend in annual food inflation on the back of unprocessed food prices. Energy prices increased by 2.15 percent in December, with the upswing spread across all subcategories due to soaring oil prices and the tumbling Turkish lira. Thus, annual energy inflation increased by a total of 5.70 points in the last four months to 8.67 percent. Leading indicators suggest that energy inflation has remained on the rise over January due to exchange rate changes.
3.    Prices of services edged up by 0.38 percent, while annual services inflation rose by 0.17 points to 8.11 percent in December. Annual inflation decreased in transport, remained almost flat in communication and went up in other subcategories. The slowdown in domestic demand and the sluggish tourism industry spilled over into prices of services, while several subcategories reflected the effects of the Turkish lira depreciation.
4.    Annual core goods inflation inched up by 0.84 points to 6.77 percent in December. Annual inflation decreased in clothing, but increased in other subcategories. Among durables goods, all subcategories, home appliances in particular, saw considerable price hikes. Automobile prices were affected by the SCT hike, along with exchange rate developments. The depreciation in the Turkish lira was evident in core good prices in December despite restrictive domestic demand conditions.
5.    Although aggregate demand conditions put a downward pressure, inflation is expected to remain on an upward track in the short term due to the lagged exchange rate pass-through and volatile unprocessed food prices.
Factors Affecting Inflation 
6.    Recent data indicate that economic activity rebounded somewhat in the fourth quarter after the third-quarter deceleration. Despite a mild production growth across exporting industries, sectors with a relatively higher sensitivity to domestic demand weakened, causing industrial output to remain flat in November. Data on the production of electricity and vehicles and exports point to a modest growth in industrial output for December. Thus, industrial production is likely to post a quarterly gain in the fourth quarter thanks to the base effect coming from working day adjustment. However, apart from the technical recovery driven by working day effects, there is only a moderate recovery in economic activity which is not evenly spread across all sectors. 
7.    Current data indicate the external demand was more robust than domestic demand in the fourth quarter. Non-gold exports were up quarter-on-quarter in the October-November period, while non-gold imports edged down. Likewise, the PMI’s new export orders rose above the neutral mark in the fourth quarter, while total orders posted a small quarterly gain. In this period, domestic sales of automobiles and home appliances were robust amid brought-forward demand, whereas the demand for services was on the decline, particularly in retail.
8.    Economic activity is expected to recover further amid accommodative incentives and measures. The data on mortgage and auto markets accompanied by the recent recovery in consumer loans bolster the projections for a gradual improvement. Moreover, the public sector is expected to provide further investment support to growth in the coming months.
9.    The growing EU demand continues to stimulate total exports, the auto industry in particular. Turkey’s flexibility in diversifying markets continues to cushion exports against the negative effects of geopolitical tensions on external demand. Furthermore, the newly-restored relations with neighbor countries translated into a boost for exports. The sluggish outlook in tourism sector continues to have a negative impact on the current account balance, which, however, is alleviated by the lagged pass-through of terms-of-trade developments and the moderate course of loans. However, commodity prices are expected to gradually have a less of a positive influence on the current account deficit in the upcoming period.
10.     The deterioration in the labor market, which began in May, continued through October. This period saw modest increases in services and industrial employment in contrast to a decline in the construction sector. Meanwhile, leading indicators such as new job vacancies and unemployment insurance claims suggest that employment remains subdued and unemployment rates will continue to remain high.
11.     In sum, economic activity slightly recovered in the fourth quarter and is expected to record a moderate growth in 2016. However, reverberations of recent market volatility through confidence channel, the potential impact of recent global and geopolitical developments on financial conditions and the lack of any signs of improvement in tourism outlook limit the pace of economic recovery.  
Monetary Policy and Risks
12.    Following the US elections in November 2016, global economic uncertainties intensified. In this period, long-term interest rates increased in advanced economies, while capital flows towards emerging economies subsided. The increased likelihood of the adoption of protective policies in the US following the elections poses a downside risk to the pace of growth and employment in emerging economies. In addition, the increased possibility of accommodative fiscal policies to be adopted by the US may lead to accelerated rate hikes by the Fed, which may result in further tightening of financial conditions in emerging economies.
13.    Not only the ongoing uncertainties in global markets but also the geopolitical and domestic developments caused fluctuations in domestic financial markets in the fourth quarter of 2016. The adverse impact of these on financial conditions are partially counterbalanced through liquidity measures, macroprudential policies and other incentives. In fact, consumer loans and TL-denominated commercial loans have recently been signaling for recovery. On the other hand, tax arrangements done in the last quarter of the year, coupled with exchange rate developments led the demand for automobiles and durable goods to be brought forward at end-2016. Thus, the revival in consumer loans may lose some pace in the first quarter of 2017.
14.    Recently-released data hint at a noticeable economic slowdown in the third quarter of the year. Thanks to the accommodative incentives and measures, domestic demand recorded an improvement in the last quarter. Nevertheless, sectoral diffusion of this improvement remained limited and underlying trend of economic activity registered a mild growth. Recent indicators suggest that the depreciation in the Turkish lira and the repercussions through confidence channel may lead to a slowdown in domestic demand in the first quarter of the year. However, as uncertainties and volatility in financial markets wane, the economy is expected to revert to its underlying trend in the ensuing period and display a moderate growth in 2017. On the other hand, the pace of recovery in tourism revenues, the global economic outlook, uncertainties regarding the monetary policies of advanced economies and geopolitical developments pose downside risks to the economic activity, while possible lagged effects of recent incentives and measures are considered as the upside risk factor. Retaining price stability as the main objective, the CBRT closely monitors also the reverberations of the downside risks to economic activity on financial stability.
15.    The Committee evaluated medium-term projections to be presented in the January Inflation Report in the meeting. In the last quarter, inflation increased due to the energy, alcohol-tobacco and unprocessed food groups. Although aggregate demand conditions continued to be disinflationary, rises in the exchange rate and commodity prices increased the underlying trend of core inflation. In the short term, the base effect from unprocessed food prices and developments in the TL-denominated import prices are expected to drive inflation upwards significantly. Hence, it is projected that despite the restrictive effect of the mild course of aggregate demand, inflation will remain high for a while due to cost pressures, and display a gradual decline as of the second half of the year. Forecasts are based on the assumption that despite the tourism-induced slowdown in food demand and the support from the actions taken by the Food Committee, the base effect from unprocessed food prices, the probable effects of the adverse weather conditions on the food supply and the exchange rate developments will push the end-2017 food inflation upwards compared to the figures of the previous report. Accordingly, year-end inflation forecasts for 2017 and 2018 were revised upwards by 1.5 and 1 points, respectively compared to the October Inflation Report. Given a tight policy stance that focuses on bringing inflation down, inflation is likely to be 8 percent in 2017, 6 percent in 2018 and stabilize around 5 percent in 2019. 
16.    There are both downside and upside risks to inflation forecasts, yet upside risks to end-2017 inflation forecast seem more evident. Recently, the marked rise in foreign exchange market volatility poses an upside risk to inflation from expectations and pricing behavior channels as well as from the cost channel. On the other hand, the projected disinflationary effect of demand conditions may be higher, if economic activity recovers slower than expected in the period ahead. Risks to food inflation -another factor shaping forecasts- are considered to be balanced. Despite the possibility of food inflation to prove higher than expected still resides amid adverse weather conditions and the reverberations of the exchange rate, measures taken by the Food Committee are believed to counterbalance these risks. The CBRT will closely monitor the developments regarding inflation outlook and continue to take necessary policy measures to achieve price stability.
17.    Against this background, starting from January 2017, the CBRT took a series of liquidity measures in response to the excessive exchange rate volatility and deterioration in the inflation outlook and decided to strengthen the tight monetary policy stance in the January MPC Meeting. In this respect, the marginal funding rate and the late liquidity window lending rate were hiked by 75 and 100 basis points to 9.25 and 11 percent, respectively. The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered. Moreover, necessary liquidity measures will be taken in case of unhealthy pricing behavior in the foreign exchange market that cannot be justified by economic fundamentals.
18.    The fact that the excessive volatility observed in the foreign exchange market in January 2017 was not accompanied by a change in macro framework or economic fundamentals, required a dynamic tightening practice inclusive of alternative liquidity instruments. While a simple policy framework enhances the effectiveness of transmission mechanism, it does not rule out these type of dynamic reactions. 
19.    Developments in fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The contribution of adjustments in administered prices to consumer inflation in 2016 was above historical averages. This emerged as one of the main determinants of higher inflation than the CBRT’s forecasts issued at the start of the year. The baseline monetary policy stance for the upcoming period is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
20.    In recent years, sustaining fiscal discipline has become one of the major factors in reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks. Moreover, the room provided by the fiscal discipline facilitates the countercyclical implementation of the fiscal policy in periods of slowing economic activity without a permanent deterioration in budget balances, as in 2016. Nevertheless, designing public spending and tax policies in a way that takes into account the subsequent effects on macroeconomic variables other than fiscal accounts such as growth, domestic savings and inflation, will contribute to the coordination of monetary policy and fiscal policy, and enhance macroeconomic stability."

Governor Murat Çetinkaya’s Speech on “Macroeconomic Outlook and Monetary Policy”
In his presentation on “Macroeconomic Outlook and Monetary Policy” at J.P. Morgan Turkey Macro and Credit Conference in London, Governor Murat Çetinkaya emphasized the following points:
•    The Turkish economy has proved resilient amid several persistent shocks in recent years.
•    Although GDP contracted in the third quarter of 2016, more recent data suggest that this will be short-lived and economic activity will recover moderately in the forthcoming period.
•    Inflation may further edge up in the short term before gradually coming down to 8 percent at the end of the year.
•    The CBRT has implemented a comprehensive and strong monetary tightening to contain the deterioration in the pricing behavior that may result from the recent exchange rate volatility.
•    Tighter monetary policy along with coordinated action by fiscal authorities will contain the second round effects of the cost-push developments.
•    The fiscal authority’s announcement that no additional tax hikes are envisaged for the year 2017 is a reflection of the enhanced coordination.
•    The current policy stance indicates a clear and stable tightening which will be preserved until there is a significant improvement in inflation dynamics.
•    The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective.

Press Release on the Maximum Interest Rates for Credit Cards in Q2 2017
The monthly maximum interest rates that banks can charge on credit card borrowing in the second quarter of 2017 have been left unchanged.
Banks in Turkey, as is the case in other countries, charge higher interest rates for credit card borrowing than they do for consumer loans. The CBRT, therefore, advises credit card holders with short-term credit needs to seek a consumer loan rather than borrowing on personal credit cards.

In his speech on “Macroeconomic Outlook and Price Stability” at Denizli Platform of Industrialists, Merchants and Businessmen, Governor Murat Çetinkaya emphasized the following points:
•    Economic activity displays a moderate recovery while the underlying trend in the current account balance shows a resumption of the improvement trend.
•    Pass-through from recent exchange rate developments may lead to upside inflationary pressures in the short term; yet, with the support of the tight monetary stance, inflation is expected to trend downwards by mid-year.
•    Monetary tightening to contain the possible deterioration in the pricing behavior emanating from the recent exchange rate volatility has been largely effective. 
•    Heightened global uncertainty necessitates a cautious monetary policy stance. Accordingly, pricing behavior will be closely monitored and further monetary tightening will be implemented if necessary. 
•    The CBRT remains focused on the main goal of price stability. All policy instruments will be used effectively to attain this objective.
•    Additional support from structural policies is also essential for achieving price stability.
•    Encouragement of nonfinancial corporates for prudent borrowing and effective risk management is a structural dimension which can be further improved.

DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Participating Committee Members
Murat Çetinkaya (Governor), Ahmet Faruk Aysan, Erkan Kilimci, Emrah Şener, Murat Uysal, Abdullah Yavaş.
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates at the following levels:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been kept at 9.25 percent and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.25 percent.
b) One-week repo rate has been kept at 8 percent,
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been increased from 11 percent to 11.75 percent.
Recently released data indicate a gradual recovery in the economic activity. Demand from the European Union economies continues to contribute positively to exports, while domestic demand displays a weaker course. With the supportive measures and incentives provided recently, the recovery in the economic activity is expected to continue at a moderate pace. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly.
Cost push pressures and the volatility in food prices in recent months have led to a sharp increase in inflation. The significant rise in inflation is expected to continue in the short term due to lagged pass-through and the base effect in food prices. Accordingly, the Committee decided to strengthen the monetary tightening in order to contain the deterioration in the inflation outlook.  
The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
2017,23 March 2017,SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING,"No: 2017-15
23 March 2017
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 16 March 2017
Inflation Developments
1.    In February, consumer prices were up 0.81 percent and annual inflation increased by 0.91 points to 10.13 percent. Annual food inflation continued to climb while exchange rate changes seemed to be passed through to all items, especially to core goods and energy. Notwithstanding temporary tax reductions, the cumulative TL depreciation caused the core goods inflation to soar, driving the annual inflation and underlying trend of core indicators higher.
2.    Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 0.95 points in February to 8.72 percent, largely due to higher prices of fresh fruits and other unprocessed food. On the processed food front, the monthly price increase gained momentum while the annual inflation rose to 7.06 percent. Leading indicators for March signal a sharp upswing in annual food price inflation mainly on the back of the base effect from unprocessed food. Energy prices remained on an uptrend, which spread across all subcategories. Thus, annual energy inflation soared by 2.34 points in February to 13.94 percent. Annual energy inflation is expected to edge down in March amid on back of international oil prices.
3.    Prices of services rose by 0.68 percent while annual services inflation edged up by 0.10 points to 8.37 percent in February. Annual inflation increased in transport and communication but remained relatively flat in other subcategories. Transport services were largely affected by the cumulative increase in fuel prices. Rent inflation remained elevated at 9.4 percent.
4.    Annual core goods inflation increased by 1.65 points to 8.83 percent in February. All subcategories were influenced by the spillovers from the depreciating Turkish lira. February discounts lagged well behind historical averages in the clothing industry despite weaker output and external demand, whereas temporary tax cuts put a lid on price hikes in durable goods. Prices were also significantly higher across core goods other than clothing and durables due to the exchange rate pass-through as well as the increased customs duty on cosmetics. The cumulative depreciation of the Turkish lira may continue to put upward pressure on core goods inflation in March.
5.    In short, cost push pressures and the volatility in food prices in recent months have led to a sharp increase in inflation. The significant rise in inflation is expected to continue in the short term due to lagged pass-through and the base effect in unprocessed food prices.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6.    Recently released data indicate a gradual recovery in the economic activity. Industrial production posted a quarterly growth in the fourth quarter of 2016. However, subtracting the offset work day losses of the third quarter, the output growth is a moderate one that fails to spread across all sectors. Auto and home sales were robust in the fourth quarter thanks to demand being brought forward, yet only a number of sectors saw a recovering domestic demand. Moreover, although public investments provided an added boost to the economy, the recovery in investment demand was much slower than in consumption.
7.    With the supportive measures and incentives provided recently, the recovery in the economic activity is expected to continue at a moderate pace. First-quarter data suggest that the economic recovery is moderate and not quite widespread yet. Despite a strong industrial production in January, the sectoral growth is uneven and the underlying trend is weaker. Although the production in industrial sectors subject to incentives, such as furniture and construction, showed signs of recovery, the gloomy outlook in sectors of services, particularly retail, suggested that there is no strong recovery in domestic demand. In fact, domestic demand seems to be slowing due to demand being brought forward in the fourth quarter of 2016 as well as the recent TL plunge and the weakening confidence. However, the extension of housing tax reductions and recent employment incentives are likely to buoy up domestic demand and growth in the coming months.
8.    Despite a relatively sluggish domestic demand, the growing EU demand continues to stimulate total exports, the auto industry in particular. Turkey’s flexibility in diversifying markets continues to cushion exports against the negative effects of geopolitical tensions on external demand. Furthermore, the restoring relations with neighboring countries translated into a boost for exports. The sluggish outlook in tourism sector continues to have a negative impact on the current account balance, which, however, is alleviated by the recent developments in real exchange rates and the moderate course of loans.
9.    The deterioration in the labor market that began in May continued through December. In this period, industrial and construction employment fell whereas services employment remained flat. Meanwhile, leading indicators, such as new job vacancies, the PMI employment index and the expected number of employees in services and construction, suggest that employment is subdued and unemployment rates will remain high.
10.    In sum, economic activity exhibited a gradual recovery in the last quarter and a moderate growth is expected for 2016. Economic activity is projected to display a slow gradual and slow rebound in 2017. However, the course of capital flows in line with uncertainties regarding global economic policies, geopolitical developments, the subsided course of the labor market and the lingering volatility in exchange rates may stand out as factors to limit the pace of growth in 2017.
Monetary Policy and Risks
11.    Leading indicators and expectations regarding global economic activity have recently been favorable. Both the electoral climate in Europe and news on how the US trade and fiscal policies will be shaped weigh on the volatility in financial markets, while diminished uncertainties over global monetary policies support the global risk appetite. Backed also by positive growth prospects, portfolio inflows are observed in emerging economies. Meanwhile, following a marked increase in 2016, global energy prices displayed a steady outlook in the last couple of months owing to favorable supply conditions in the energy market.
12.    Parallel to a tighter stance in January 2017, Turkey’s financial indicators have recorded an improvement. Recent losses in all indicators were mostly redeemed, which led to a positive divergence between Turkey and other emerging economies. Moreover, loan rates remain mild despite the rise in the CBRT funding rate; and the revival in loan growth continues due to the partial recovery in growth outlook, macroprudential arrangements and public incentives. In fact, consumer loans and TL-denominated commercial loan growth caught up with past averages.
13.    Domestic demand registered a recovery in the last quarter of 2016, yet sectoral diffusion of this recovery proved limited and the underlying trend of the economy exhibited a mild growth. Recent indicators show that the TL depreciation and the confidence channel have led to a deceleration in domestic demand. Nevertheless, owing both to waning uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets and the incentives supporting the economy, a mild economic growth is expected in the upcoming period. On the other hand, the pace of recovery in tourism revenues, the global economic outlook, uncertain global economic policies and geopolitical developments pose a downside risk to economic activity. Meanwhile, possible lagged effects of recent incentives and measures are considered to be upside risks.
14.    The mild trend in economic activity notwithstanding, cost pressures arising out of the cumulative effects of the depreciation in the TL led to a significant rise in inflation. Exchange rate volatility pose an upside risk to inflation through the cost channel as well as the expectations and the pricing behavior channel. In the coming period, not only the lagged effects of the exchange rate developments but also the base effect from unprocessed food prices is projected to push inflation further upwards in the short term.
15.    Against this background, the Committee decided to strengthen the monetary tightening in order to contain the deterioration in the inflation outlook. At the March meeting, the late liquidity window lending rate was raised from 11 percent to 11.75 percent, while the other CBRT rates were kept unchanged. The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.
16.    Developments in fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance for the upcoming period is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices and taxes. Accordingly, the gradual elimination of the effect of 2016 tax increases on annual inflation may support the disinflation process. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
17.    In recent years, sustaining fiscal discipline has become one of the major factors in reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks. Moreover, the room provided by the fiscal discipline facilitates the countercyclical implementation of the fiscal policy in periods of slowing economic activity without a permanent deterioration in budget balances, as in 2016. Designing public spending and tax policies under a holistic approach that takes into account the subsequent effects on other macroeconomic variables such as growth, domestic savings and inflation, as well as the budget balance will contribute to furthering the coordination of monetary policy and fiscal policy, and enhance macroeconomic stability and price stability as well."

2017,28 April 2017,SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING,"No: 2017-21
28 April 2017
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING 
Meeting Date: 26 April 2017
Inflation Developments  
1.    In March, consumer prices were up 1.02 percent and annual inflation increased by 1.16 points to 11.29 percent. As stated in the summary of the MPC meeting in March, annual food inflation was the key driver of the rising consumer inflation in this period due, among others, to the low base effect from a year earlier. On the other hand, energy prices inched down amid lower international oil prices. Services inflation remained high while core goods saw widespread price hikes due to the lagged effect of the cumulative Turkish lira depreciation. Thus, core inflation indicators remained on the rise.
2.    Prices of food and nonalcoholic beverages increased by 1.93 percent in March, bringing annual inflation up by 3.81 points to 12.53 percent in this subcategory. This upsurge was mostly attributed to higher unprocessed food prices, particularly for fresh fruits, and the low base effect. On the processed food front, prices continued to rise rapidly month-on-month due to exchange rates, causing annual processed food inflation to hit 7.28 percent. Leading indicators for April signal that annual food inflation will increase sharply on the back of the base effect from unprocessed food. Energy prices edged down by 0.95 percent amid lower international oil prices in March. Accordingly, after having surged since June 2016, annual energy inflation declined to 12.19 percent in this period.
3.    Prices of services rose by 0.63 percent while annual services inflation inched up by 0.27 points to 8.64 percent in March. Annual inflation was up in transport and other services but remained flat in other subcategories. Prices of transport services were driven higher by the lagged effects of rising fuel prices. Across other services, both exchange rates and the high level of headline inflation pushed inflation higher in subcategories such as maintenance and repair, healthcare and education. Rent inflation remained elevated.
4.    Annual core goods inflation increased by 1.63 points to 10.46 percent in March. The lagged spillovers of the depreciating Turkish lira continued to weigh on all subcategories. Clothing and footwear prices soared much faster than historical averages in March. Prices of durable goods were up mainly because of the exchange rate-stricken auto industry. In this period, prices of core goods excluding clothing and durables increased dramatically due to the exchange rate pass-through.
5.    In summary, cost-push pressures and the volatility in food prices in recent months have led to a sharp increase in inflation. Although the recent improvement in the risk appetite contains some of the upside pressures from cost factors, current elevated levels of inflation pose risks on the pricing behavior.
Factors Affecting Inflation 
6.    Data for the fourth quarter of 2016 confirmed the conjecture that the third-quarter economic slowdown was transitory. In this period, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded by 3.8 percent quarter-on-quarter and 3.5 percent year-on-year. Excluding the offset work day losses of the third quarter, the fourth quarter was marked by a moderate growth. The TURKSTAT’s upward revisions to the first three quarters of 2016 showed that the level of economic activity was much higher than anticipated. Hence, the economy grew by 2.9 percent in 2016, a rate much lower than past years’ averages.
7.    Annual growth was driven by domestic demand in the last quarter of 2016. Private spending was up both annually and quarterly thanks to the demand brought forward by automobile tax adjustments, eased macroprudential measures and better financial conditions. Investments, particularly machinery and equipment investments, were relatively weak in this period. With exports accelerating in the last quarter, net external demand provided considerably higher contribution to quarterly growth and a slightly better contribution to annual growth compared to the first nine months of 2016.
8.    The first-quarter data for 2017 hint at diminishing recovery in economic activity in the first quarter. Following a robust increase in January, industrial production contracted in February. Rapid depreciation of the Turkish lira at the start of the quarter, uncertainties led by volatile financial markets and the leap in inflation are projected to dampen consumption and investment spending. Although tax incentives stimulate the demand for houses, furniture and home appliances, the recovery in domestic demand fails to spread across all sectors. Indicators for March and April signal for a stronger economic activity and labor market. In brief, the mild recovery in the underlying trend of economic activity continues, which is enhanced by supportive incentives and measures.
9.    Despite a partial recovery in domestic demand, net external demand spurs growth with robust increases in exports of goods that spill over into all sectors. The growing demand from the European Union economies, normalizing relations with neighboring countries, the course of the real exchange rate, and Turkey’s market-shifting flexibility abroad continues to stimulate exports. Increases in exports of goods translate into a decelerated deterioration in the current account deficit and improvement in core current account deficit indicators. In addition to the expected partial recovery in tourism, the robust course of exports of goods is expected to contribute positively to the current account.
10.    The worsening trend in the labor market that began in May 2016 came to a halt in January 2017. In this period, non-farm employment recorded an uptick particularly with the contribution from the services sector. Meanwhile, leading indicators, such as new job vacancies, the PMI employment index and the expectations for the number of employees in services and construction for March and April suggest a recovery in the employment outlook. Amid the mild rebound in economic activity and the announced employment incentive packages, the partial improvement in unemployment rates is expected to continue.
11.    In sum, the recently released data indicate a gradual recovery in the economic activity. Domestic demand conditions display a moderate improvement and demand from the European Union economies continues to contribute positively to exports. With the supportive measures and incentives provided recently, the economic activity is expected to gain further pace in the forthcoming period. However, the course of capital flows in line with uncertainties regarding global economic policies, geopolitical developments, the subsided course of the labor market and the lingering volatility in exchange rates may stand out as factors to limit the pace of growth in 2017.
Monetary Policy and Risks
12.    Financial market impact of expectations about post-election US economic policies has started to wane since early 2017. Compared to the previous reporting period, indicators of economic activity point at a stronger global growth in 2017, owing especially to advanced economies. However, uncertainties over the Brexit process and blurred prospects for post-electoral economic policies in the US keep downside risks to global growth brisk. As of the first quarter of 2017, the upward trend in advanced economies’ long-term bond yields which started in November came to a halt, and portfolio flows to bond and stock markets of emerging economies resumed thanks to abated uncertainties over the Fed policy accompanied by optimistic expectations in financial markets. Although there is a slight recovery in recent global financial conditions, the pace of the Fed’s monetary tightening cycle will be the determining factor on the direction and volume of portfolio flows to emerging economies.
13.    Despite the relative improvement in global financial conditions, domestic financial conditions tightened slightly in the first quarter of 2017 due to the partly persistent volatility in the exchange rate market and the tightening in monetary policy. On the other hand, the Turkish lira has recently diverged positively from other emerging economy currencies and offset past losses to some extent. Moreover, macroprudential policies supporting the financial system, public incentives and public credit guarantees allowed credit conditions to continue to recover. The recovery in consumer loans and Turkish lira denominated commercial loans observed in the first quarter of 2017 is monitored closely with regard to its effects on aggregate demand and economic activity.
14.    Downside risks to economic activity have recently abated. The growth outlook for 2017 is expected to be more favorable compared to 2016 which was subject to numerous concurrent adverse shocks. The relative stability in tourism revenues, the strengthened confidence channel, the favorable effect of the cumulative exchange rate depreciation on net exports, and the normalization of commercial relations with Russia will all contribute to growth. Moreover, measures and incentives to stimulate consumption and investment expenditures, fading perceptions of uncertainty and the improvement in the tightness of financial conditions will also enhance growth. Accordingly, economic activity is expected to strengthen as of the second quarter of the year. On the other hand, the pace of recovery in tourism revenues, uncertainties regarding monetary policies of advanced economies, the course of capital flows and geopolitical developments constitute downside risks to growth in 2017 as well as it has recently.
15.    Consumer inflation has surged since November 2016 and rose above the upper band of January forecasts. The upward trend in inflation was largely driven by the depreciation in the Turkish lira and the rise in import prices in addition to the increase in food prices. The rapid depreciation in the Turkish lira spread across the consumer price index, particularly to energy and durable goods items.
16.    The Committee evaluated medium-term projections to be presented in the April Inflation Report in the meeting. Year-end inflation forecasts for 2017 and 2018 were revised upwards by 0.5 and 0.4 points, respectively, compared to the 2017 January Inflation Report. Given a tight policy stance that focuses on bringing inflation down, inflation is estimated to converge gradually to the 5-percent target. Accordingly, inflation is likely to be 8.5 percent at end-2017, and stabilize around 5 percent in the medium term after falling to 6.4 percent in 2018. As also indicated in the previous Report, due to the base effects stemming from the prices of unprocessed food, tobacco and clothing as well as temporary tax reductions, consumer inflation will fluctuate throughout 2017. Inflation is expected to reach the highest levels in April-May particularly due to the base effect from unprocessed food and the lagged effects of the exchange rate, and then to fall thereafter as the impact of last year’s price increases in energy, alcohol-tobacco products and food gradually diminishes. The tight monetary stance will support the disinflation process.
17.    Aggregate demand conditions on which medium-term inflation forecasts are based, continue to have a disinflationary effect albeit at a more limited extent in comparison with the January Report. The upward revision in last year’s national income data and the acceleration in credit indicate that the recovery in economic activity might be stronger than expected. However high levels of unemployment rates suggest that the demand-side risks on inflation are balanced. The effects on aggregate demand conditions, of production and employment incentives and measures to boost the credit market, will be closely monitored in the upcoming period.
18.    Risks to food inflation – another major determinant of inflation forecasts – are considered to be on the upside. Due to the recovery in the exports of food products and the impact of the exchange rate developments, food inflation might exceed current projections, which are based on the assumption that measures taken by the Food Committee will considerably balance the upside risks to food prices.
19.    Although the recent improvement in the risk appetite contains some of the upside pressures from cost factors, current elevated levels of inflation pose risks on the pricing behavior. Accordingly, the Committee decided to strengthen the monetary tightening in order to contain the deterioration in the inflation outlook, and raised the Late Liquidity Window lending rate from 11.75 percent to 12.25 percent in its April meeting. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement. The CBRT formulates monetary policy in consideration of the medium-term inflation outlook, thus, focuses on the developments in the underlying trend of inflation rather than the anticipated fluctuations in inflation driven by the base effects during the course of the year. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.
20.    Developments in fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance for the upcoming period is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework and have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
21.    In recent years, sustained fiscal discipline has been one of key factors in lowering the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks. Countercyclical fiscal policy has been implemented recently, thanks to the space provided by fiscal discipline. Structural measures, which would improve the potential to implement countercyclical fiscal policy, will contribute to the coordination of monetary and fiscal policy, and thus support macroeconomic stability."

Press Release on the Maximum Interest Rates for Credit Cards in Q3 2017
The monthly maximum interest rates that banks can charge on credit card borrowing in the third quarter of 2017 have been left unchanged.
Banks in Turkey, as is the case in other countries, charge higher interest rates for credit card borrowing than they do for consumer loans. The CBRT, therefore, advises credit card holders with short-term credit needs to seek a consumer loan rather than borrowing on personal credit cards.

DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
 
Participating Committee Members
Murat Çetinkaya (Governor), Erkan Kilimci, Emrah Şener, Murat Uysal, Abdullah Yavaş.
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 9.25 percent and borrowing rate at 7.25 percent,
b) One-week repo rate at 8 percent,
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.25 percent.
Recently released data indicate that the recovery in the economic activity has gained pace. Domestic demand conditions have improved and demand from the European Union economies continues to contribute positively to exports. The economic activity is expected to further accelerate due to the supportive measures and incentives provided recently. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly.
Although recent improvements in cost factors and expected partial correction in food prices will contribute to disinflation, current elevated levels of inflation pose risks on the pricing behavior. Accordingly, the Committee decided to maintain the tight stance of monetary policy.
The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

22 June 2017
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 15 June 2017
Inflation Developments
1. In May, consumer prices were up 0.45 percent and annual inflation fell 0.15 points to 11.72 percent. Food inflation remained on the rise while energy inflation continued to slow. The lagged effects of the cumulative Turkish lira depreciation continued to weigh upon core goods whereas annual core goods inflation declined due to the methodology change to clothing prices. Adjusted for these transient effects, the improvement in underlying inflation remained limited in this period.
2. Annual inflation in food and nonalcoholic beverages increased by 1.28 points to 16.91 percent in May largely due to the annual fresh fruits and vegetables inflation that hit 48 percent. Price hikes were also common across food excluding fresh fruits and vegetables, notably in red meat. Leading indicators for June signal that annual food inflation will decrease on the back of the base effect from unprocessed food. Annual energy inflation fell further in May due to exchange rates and lower oil prices, to 8.72 percent. Leading indicators suggest that annual energy inflation has continued to slow in June.
3. Prices of services rose by 0.93 percent while annual services inflation edged up by 0.19 points to 9.06 percent in May. Factors affecting services inflation included cost increases driven by exchange rates and food prices and indexation to headline inflation. 
4. Annual core goods inflation dropped by 0.31 points to 9.71 percent in May, mainly due to the temporary impact of the methodology change to weight system of the clothing category. In non-clothing categories, annual inflation continued to climb because of the lagged spillovers of the cumulative Turkish lira depreciation. More specifically, prices soared at a much faster rate than historical averages across core goods excluding clothing and durables.
5. All in all, inflation remains high. Despite recent cost developments and the expected partial improvement in food prices, risks to the pricing behavior still prevail.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6. In the first quarter, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded by 5.0 percent year-on-year and 1.4 percent quarter-on-quarter, thus indicating economic activity picked up further. Key drivers of quarterly growth were, in sequence, exports, construction investments and public consumption. Machinery and equipment investments remained sluggish, while private consumption slowed due to demand being brought forward. The high contribution from net exports to quarterly growth translates into a growth composition buoying up the current account balance.
7. Leading indicators hint at a strengthening economic recovery in the second quarter. April’s industrial production and May PMI data signaled a more robust increase for the second quarter than in the previous one. Not only the manufacturing industry, but also services, retail trade and construction saw strengthening activity recently. Accordingly, economic recovery appears to be more widespread across sectors.
8. A similar outlook is also visible in demand indicators. Both consumer confidence and investment tendency have improved recently. The consumer demand for categories subject to incentives remains strong while investments signal some pickup after the subdued course in the first quarter. Domestic demand is likely to make more contribution to growth in the second quarter.
9. Domestic demand keeps recovering while net external demand spurs growth amid robust increases in exports of goods that spill over into a wide range of sectors and destinations. The improving growth outlook across the globe, particularly for the EU, and Turkey’s flexibility to shift markets abroad continue to stimulate exports. Increases in exports of goods slow down the deterioration of the current account deficit and help improve core current account deficit indicators. Strong course of exports of goods are expected to continue to contribute positively to the current account.
10. The labor market picked up in March for the second month in a row. In this period, non-farm employment recorded an uptick, particularly in construction and industrial sectors. Although economic recovery has yet to fully seep through to the labor market in the first quarter, March data and leading indicators show a more upbeat picture for the second quarter. With a more solid economic rebound, employment gains will likely be more notable in the upcoming period while unemployment rates may decline further.
11. In sum, recent data indicate a strengthening recovery in economic activity. Domestic demand has improved and the growing EU demand continues to contribute positively to exports. Economic activity is expected to strengthen further amid supportive incentives and measures. The Committee assesses that implementing structural reforms would augment potential growth significantly.
Monetary Policy and Risks
12. Global economic activity continues to improve. This improvement, which appears simultaneously in advanced and emerging economies, accompany the upward revision in global growth forecasts, and they both underpin the optimism in global markets. Inflation still hovers low despite the favorable growth outlook, which leads advanced economies to sustain the accommodative monetary policy stance. In addition, due to the perceptions for a milder monetary tightening by the Fed, global risk appetite hit historically high levels, and emerging economies saw accelerated portfolio inflows as of March 2017.
13. Despite the recovery in global economic activity, energy prices, which have recently been on the decline, lend the inflation prospects and current account balance a helping hand. The recent favorable outlook notwithstanding, downside risks to global economy still reside.  Blurred process of the Fed’s balance sheet downsizing, the political climate in Europe, the course of Brexit talks and geopolitical developments are the factors that may alter the risk sentiment in a short time.
14. Thanks also to the tight monetary policy stance, Turkey still diverges positively from other emerging economies in the exchange rate and risk premium indicators. Backed by macroprudential policies and credit guarantee support, retail loans and TL-denominated business loans has grown considerably since the start of the year. In the banking sector, as the supply-side effects step in, the fast loan growth is expected to be soon replaced by a milder outlook. The improvement in credits is monitored closely with regard to the extent of their impact on the aggregate demand and economic activity.
15. Recently-released indicators confirm that downside risks to economic activity have abated and the economic rebound will prove more robust as of the second quarter of the year. Thus, growth prospects for 2017 recorded a progress. Tourism revenues stabilized relatively, the cumulative depreciation affected net exports positively and trade relations with Russia started to normalize, which all underpin growth. What is more, the measures and incentive packages to boost consumption and investment expenditures, reduced uncertainty and improved financial conditions contribute to growth. On the other hand, the pace of recovery in tourism revenues, uncertainties regarding monetary policies of advanced economies, the course of capital flows and geopolitical developments constitute a downside risk to growth also in 2017, as it has recently.
16. The recent stable course of the Turkish lira and the falling commodity prices notwithstanding, cumulative effects of cost factors on inflation lingers. The correction in food prices has not reached desired levels yet, thus requires a cautious stance regarding the permanence of the sizeable decreases expected in June and July to result from the base effect in the group’s inflation. Moreover, temporary tax reductions in white goods and furniture sectors to be taken back in October accompanied by the effects of the methodological changes in the clothing group are also noted as the developments envisaged to cause fluctuations in inflation in the short term. Additionally, the Committee evaluated that as the improvement in economic activity gets stronger, demand conditions will offer less support to the disinflation process.
17. In short, although recent improvements in cost factors and expected partial correction in food prices will contribute to disinflation, current elevated levels of inflation pose risks to the pricing behavior. Accordingly, the Committee decided to maintain the tight stance of monetary policy at the June Meeting, and kept the lending rate at 12.25 percent under the Late Liquidity Window. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.
18. Developments in fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance for the upcoming period is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices and taxes. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework and have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
19. In recent years, sustained fiscal discipline has been one of key factors in lowering the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks. Thanks to the room for maneuver provided by fiscal discipline, stabilizing fiscal policy could have been implemented recently. Structural measures, which would improve the potential to implement countercyclical fiscal policy, will contribute to the coordination of monetary and fiscal policy, and thus support macroeconomic stability."

2017,01 August 2017,SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING,"No: 2017-31
01 August 2017
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 27 July 2017
Inflation Developments
1. In June, consumer prices were down 0.27 percent and annual inflation decreased by 0.82 points to 10.90 percent. Food inflation dropped on the back of fresh fruits and vegetables while annual energy inflation continued to decelerate. The lagged effects of the cumulative Turkish lira depreciation continued to weigh upon core goods whereas annual core goods inflation declined due to prices of durable goods. There is an improvement in underlying inflation in this period, even after adjusting for the transient effects of the methodology change in the clothing price index.
2. Annual inflation in food and nonalcoholic beverages fell by 2.57 points to 14.34 percent in June due to the reduction in annual fresh fruits and vegetables inflation coming from the base effect. On the other hand, annual inflation remained on the rise across food excluding fresh fruits and vegetables, with red meat prices recording large increases. Leading indicators for July signal that annual food inflation will continue to decrease owing to the base effect from unprocessed food. Annual energy inflation fell further in June amid a more favorable exchange rate and oil price outlook. Yet, recent developments may lead to a slight pickup in July’s energy inflation.
3. Prices of services rose by 0.53 percent while annual services inflation inched up by 0.12 points to 9.18 percent in June amid factors such as rising transport prices driven by the lagged effects of increased fuel prices, and higher catering prices due to the indirect effects of increased food inflation, particularly in red meat. In addition to cost increases driven by exchange rates, fuel prices and food prices, factors affecting services inflation also include indexation to headline inflation.
4. Annual core goods inflation dropped by 0.51 points to 9.20 percent in June on the back of durable goods prices due to recent outlook in Turkish lira. Meanwhile, annual clothing inflation remained relatively flat in this period. Across core goods excluding clothing and durables, monthly price hikes have abated yet annual inflation remained high because of the lagged spillovers of the cumulative Turkish lira depreciation.
5. In sum, inflation edged down but still remains high. Despite the disinflationary impact of recent cost developments and a likely partial correction in food prices, the high inflation remains a risk to the pricing behavior.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6. Recently released data indicate an ongoing recovery in the economic activity. An evaluation of April and May industrial production figures jointly suggests a stronger quarter-on-quarter increase in the second quarter. Survey indicators of June show that this outlook will be maintained. Not only the manufacturing industry, but also services, retail trade and construction saw strengthening activity recently. Accordingly, economic recovery appears to be more widespread across sectors.
7. A similar outlook is also visible in demand indicators. Both consumer confidence and investment tendency have improved recently. The consumer demand for categories subject to incentives remains strong while investments signal some pickup after the subdued course in the first quarter. Domestic demand is likely to make more contribution to growth in the second quarter.
8. Domestic demand keeps recovering while net external demand spurs growth amid increases in exports of goods that spill over into a wide range of sectors. The improving growth outlook across the globe, particularly for the EU, the course of the real exchange rate and Turkey’s flexibility to shift markets abroad continue to stimulate exports. Increases in exports of goods slow down the deterioration of the current account deficit and help improve core current account deficit indicators. In addition to the expected partial recovery in tourism, the uptrend in exports of goods is envisaged to contribute further to the current account balance.
9. The uptick in the labor market, which started in February and March, grew more apparent in April period. Supported by rising employment in non-farm sectors, unemployment rate records a decline. Leading indicators hint at a further decrease in unemployment rate amid the economic recovery.
10. In sum, recent data indicate that the economic activity will maintain its strength due to the supportive measures and incentives provided recently. Domestic demand conditions have improved and demand from the European Union economies continues to contribute positively to exports. The rebound in economic activity will bear favorable effects on the labor market in the upcoming period as well.
Monetary Policy and Risks
11. The mild recovery in global economic activity became more pronounced particularly due to advanced economies in the first quarter of 2017. The considerable fall in volatility in global financial markets and the increased the risk appetite reinforces the support of global financial conditions on economic activity. Moreover, the optimistic outlook in the consumer and the real sector confidence indices and the favorable course of some commodity prices, chiefly oil, also improve expectations regarding global economic activity. The favorable global growth outlook and the resulting fall in unemployment notwithstanding, the normalization process in monetary policies of advanced economies is believed to prove mild due to the absence of an apparent inflationist pressure related to wage increases. These factors keep portfolio inflows to emerging economies brisk including Turkey.
12. Despite the current favorable outlook in global economic activity, downside risks to global economy reside as well. In particular, should the normalization process of the Fed’s policy-rate increase and the balance sheet downsizing prove faster than expected, the high risk appetite and low volatility cycle in financial markets may reverse. That may generate fluctuations in prices of securities in advanced economies and weaken the growth trend. Moreover, fading risk appetite may cause fluctuations in portfolio flows to emerging economies as well. In addition to these, the course of Brexit talks and effects of the blurred global economic policies like foreign trade protectionism that is on the agenda of many countries, particularly the US, are monitored closely.
13. In line with the positive course of the global financial markets, domestic financial conditions also proved more supportive of economic activity in the second quarter. This was driven by macroprudential policies, public measures and incentives and acceleration of the credits secured by the Credit Guarantee Fund (CGF), for which the limits were raised and terms of use were facilitated as of March. On the other hand, owing to strong capital inflows to especially the GDDS markets as of March, the share of foreign investors within the GDDS stock increased, and the Treasury increased foreign borrowing due to bulky foreign demand, which offered domestic banks a considerable room on the supply side. As the upper limit defined in credits secured by the CGF is near and as the supply-side effects have recently stepped in the banking sector, credit growth which lost pace starting from June is expected to be balanced at milder levels as of the second half of the year. The improvement in credits in the first half of the year is monitored closely with regard to the extent of their impact on the aggregate demand and economic activity.
14. Recently-released indicators confirm the previous view that downside risks to economic activity have abated and the economic recovery will prove more robust as of the second quarter of the year. Signals for a wider sectoral spillover of the pickup in economic activity led by exporting sectors compared to the previous periods are important to a stable recovery in growth. The gradual improvement in tourism revenues, the strengthened confidence channel, the positive effect of the cumulative depreciation on net exports and the normalization of commercial relations with Russia support growth. Moreover, the measures and incentive packages to boost consumption and investment expenditures, reduced uncertainty and improved financial conditions will continue to spur growth. The improvement in employment and the fall in unemployment rate on the back of the ongoing recovery constitute a ground for the maintenance of this trend and increased contribution of domestic demand to growth. Investment is envisaged to exhibit a gradual improvement as uncertainties wane and the climate of confidence grows stronger. On the other hand, the pace of recovery in tourism revenues, uncertainties regarding monetary policies of advanced economies, the course of capital flows and geopolitical developments constitute a downside risk to growth also in 2017, as they have recently.
15. The favorable effects of the monetary tightening on inflation have become visible. Consumer inflation receded following on the back of falling oil prices and the recent stable course of the Turkish lira and remained broadly consistent with the forecasts in the April Inflation Report. The medium-term inflation outlook seems to have improved since the previous Reporting period, and the recovery in underlying inflation is expected to continue gradually. However, considering that the rigidity in expectations and the pricing behavior resides to a great extent, the improvement in the core inflation outlook, which is not yet deemed satisfactory, requires a tight monetary policy stance.
16. The Committee evaluated medium-term projections to be presented in the July Inflation Report in the meeting. Accordingly, year-end inflation forecast was revised upwards by 0.2 points for 2017, while it was kept unchanged for 2018 compared to the 2017 April Inflation Report. Given a tight policy stance that focuses on bringing inflation down, inflation is estimated to converge gradually to the 5-percent target. Accordingly, inflation is likely to be 8.7 percent at end-2017, and stabilize around 5 percent in the medium term after falling to 6.4 percent in 2018.
17. Although the highest inflation levels of the year are left behind, inflation is likely to follow a fluctuating course in the second half. The correction in food prices is yet to be at a favored level, which necessitates a cautious evaluation of how permanent the recent decline in the group’s inflation due to the base effects will be. Furthermore, temporary tax reductions in white goods and the furniture sector to be taken back in October as well as the effects driven by methodological changes stand out as factors that will lead to fluctuations in inflation in the short term and temporary increases in core inflation. The inflation outlook is projected to recover starting from the last month of the year, and become more evident in the early months of 2018.
18. Against this background, the Committee decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance in its July meeting and kept the Late Liquidity Window lending rate constant at 12.25 percent. The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement. The CBRT formulates monetary policy by taking the medium-term inflation into account, thus focusing on the developments in underlying inflation rather than the anticipated fluctuations driven by the base effects during the course of the year. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and further monetary tightening will be delivered if needed.
19. Developments in fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance for the upcoming period is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices and taxes. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
20. In recent years, sustained fiscal discipline has been one of key factors in lowering the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks. The room provided by fiscal discipline facilitated the implementation of expansionary fiscal policy. Structural measures to provide room for counter-cyclical fiscal policies will enhance the coordination of monetary and fiscal policy, and improve macroeconomic stability."

18 August 2017
Food and Agricultural Product Markets Monitoring and Evaluation Committee Convened
The Food and Agricultural Product Markets Monitoring and Evaluation Committee (the Committee) met under the presidency of Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Şimşek. Main topics discussed at the meeting were the livestock feed costs, livestock support programs and licensed warehouse utilization models as well as the structural issues regarding the fresh fruit-vegetable supply chain.
A summary of the agenda and the decisions made are given below.

Measures towards minimizing the loss rates along the fresh fruit-vegetable supply chain, which have reached an average of 25-30 percent and thus led to a significant financial loss, and increasing the overall quality of logistics processes were discussed. In this framework, new standards were set concerning the packaging of products after harvest in single-use and reusable packages conforming to international norms, the transportation of products in refrigerated vehicles to improve the transport processes, and the display of products in refrigerated shelves in retail stores. Decisions were made regarding the transition to the mandatory implementation of these standards and the management of this transition process.
The progress made in the work for the modernization of wholesale markets was evaluated and the Committee was informed about the steps planned to be taken. The Committee decided to discuss this topic as the main agenda item in the next Committee meeting and settle the critical issues.
The Committee decided to introduce an adjustment in customs duties on various feedstuffs to reduce the livestock feed costs that account for approximately 60 percent of meat production costs.
Suggestions for measures to increase the effectiveness of livestock incentives and subsidies were discussed.
Issues regarding licensed warehousing practices and various warehouse utilization models were discussed.
The agenda and the work schedule of the Committee were reviewed.

Press Release on the Maximum Interest Rates for Credit Cards in Q4 2017 
The monthly maximum interest rates that banks can charge on credit card borrowing in the fourth quarter of 2017 have been left unchanged.
Banks in Turkey, as is the case in other countries, charge higher interest rates for credit card borrowing than they do for consumer loans. The CBRT, therefore, advises credit card holders with short-term credit needs to seek a consumer loan rather than borrowing on personal credit cards.

2017,21 September 2017,SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING,"No: 2017-36
21 September 2017
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 14 September 2017
Inflation Developments
1. In August, consumer prices were up 0.52 percent and annual inflation rose by 0.89 points to 10.68 percent. Inflation recorded a spike in food and energy and remained elevated in services. Clothing and durable goods sent inflation soaring across core goods, pushing the annual inflation and the underlying trend of core indicators higher.
2. Annual inflation in food and nonalcoholic beverages increased by 1.9 points to 11.97 percent in August due to both a negative base effect from unprocessed food prices and widespread upsurges of processed food prices. Leading indicators for September signal that annual food inflation will remain on the rise mainly due to the base effect from unprocessed food. Energy prices jumped by 2.03 percent in August amid price developments in oil and other inputs. Thus, having been on an upward track for the last two months, annual energy inflation amounted to 10.54 percent.
3. Prices of services rose by 0.73 percent while annual services inflation remained high at a virtually unchanged 9.40 percent in August. In this period, inflation was higher across catering and accommodation services due to rising food and beverage prices as well as the recovering tourism. Other drivers of high services inflation include soaring costs and indexation to headline inflation. In fact, prices of educational services, which are largely inflation-indexed, surged by 2.79 percent, driving annual inflation up to 10.30 percent in this subcategory.
4. Annual core goods inflation increased by 1.22 points to 11.08 percent in August. Clothing and durable goods prices drove annual inflation higher amid the Turkish lira’s slide against the euro and the strong economic activity. With the methodology change for clothing factored in as well, inflation seems to be on the rise for the last two months. Among durable goods, price hikes were more prevalent in furniture, automobiles and home appliances, yet monthly price increases continued to slow across core goods excluding clothing and durable goods. Indicators for September hint at continued uptrend in core goods inflation, albeit mainly due to the methodology change in the weight system for the clothing category.
5. In sum, current elevated levels of inflation and developments in core inflation indicators pose risks to the pricing behavior.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew annually 5.1 percent and quarterly 2.1 percent in the second quarter of 2017. Economic activity was thus stronger than in the first quarter. The upward revisions to the data of previous periods were also considered as signs of an even stronger economic activity leading to the conclusion that the disinflationary contribution of demand conditions has reduced significantly as of the second quarter. The main driver of quarterly growth in this period was domestic demand, particularly construction investments and private consumption. Net exports made a negative contribution to quarterly growth due to the domestic demand-led upswing in imports and weaker exports, yet continued to boost annual growth.
7. Leading indicators suggest that economic activity remained robust in the third quarter. July’s industrial production data and the PMI data for August signal stronger growth in the third quarter compared to the previous one. Not only the manufacturing industry, but also services, retail trade and construction saw strengthening activity recently. Accordingly, economic recovery appears to be more widespread across sectors.
8. A similar outlook is also evident in demand indicators. The consumer demand for categories subject to incentives remains robust while investments edged up in the second quarter after a subdued first quarter. Domestic demand is likely to make more contribution to growth in the third quarter. Given the strengthening economy as well as the calendar and base effects, the Committee expects a sizable annual growth for the third quarter.
9. Domestic demand keeps recovering while net external demand spurs growth thanks to increases in exports of goods that spill over into a wide range of sectors. The improving growth outlook across the globe, particularly for the EU and Turkey’s flexibility to shift markets abroad continue to stimulate exports. Increases in exports of goods slow down the deterioration of the current account deficit and help improve core current account deficit indicators. In addition to the expected partial recovery in tourism, the uptrend in exports of goods is envisaged to contribute further to the current account balance.
10. The uptick in the labor market, which started in February and March, continued in June period. In this period, nonfarm employment was up on account of services. Leading indicators signal further gradual decreases in unemployment rates over the upcoming period amid economic recovery.
11. In short, recently released data indicate that the recovery in economic activity has gained strength. Domestic demand conditions keep improving and demand from the European Union economies continues to contribute positively to exports. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural reforms would contribute to potential growth significantly.
Monetary Policy and Risks
12. Global economic activity has recently settled on a trend of recovery due both to advanced and emerging economies. The optimistic outlook in the consumer and the real sector confidence indices, ongoing favorable conditions in global financing and stabilizing commodity prices also underpin the positive outlook in global economic activity. Leading indicators for the third quarter hint at a better growth performance than the second quarter, which lead to upward revisions in the year-end growth projections for 2017. While communications by advanced economy central banks regarding the normalization of monetary policies occasionally cause short-term market volatility, the monetary policy normalization process has remained moderate because of still low global inflation rates. The elevated risk appetite and the subsided volatility in global financial markets along with favorable figures regarding global growth, keep portfolio inflows to emerging economies brisk including Turkey.
13. Despite the current favorable outlook in global economic activity, downside risks to global economy reside as well. In particular, should the normalization process of the Fed’s policy-rate increase and the balance sheet downsizing prove faster than expected, the high risk appetite and low volatility cycle in financial markets may reverse. That may generate fluctuations in prices of securities in advanced economies and weaken the growth trend. Moreover, fading risk appetite also led by geopolitical developments may cause fluctuations in portfolio flows to emerging economies as well.
14. In line with the upbeat mood in global financial markets, domestic financial conditions also continued to be supportive of economic activity in the third quarter. This was driven by macroprudential policies, public measures and incentives, as well as the credits secured by the Credit Guarantee Fund (CGF), which improved overall credit conditions. As the upper limit defined in credits secured by the CGF becomes near and the supply-side effects have recently stepped in the banking sector, credit growth is balancing at milder levels, approaching past averages in the third quarter. The strong acceleration in credits in the first half of the year is monitored closely with regard to the extent of its impact on the aggregate demand and economic activity.
15. Recently-released indicators confirm the previous view that downside risks to economic activity have abated and the economic recovery will prove more robust starting from the second quarter of the year. Third-quarter indicators reveal an ongoing robust economic activity. Exports remain buoyant despite some deceleration, and investments signal for recovery on the back of the sustained improvement in domestic demand. Annual growth in the third quarter is likely to prove quite high due to the calendar and base effects. The remainder of the year is anticipated to witness a milder trend in economic activity due to the fading effects of the CGF support on growth and the withdrawal of the tax incentives on consumption expenditures.
16. Assessing the data on economic activity and the labor market jointly suggests a subsided disinflationary support from demand conditions in some sectors. Base effects in the food group, temporary tax reductions in white goods and the furniture sector that will be taken back in October as well as the methodological changes stand out as factors that will lead to fluctuations in inflation in the short term and temporary increases in core inflation. The inflation outlook is projected to improve gradually starting from the last months of the year, yet the pace and quality of this improvement will be monitored closely.
17. Against this background, the Committee decided to maintain the tight stance of monetary policy in its September meeting and kept the Late Liquidity Window lending rate constant at 12.25 percent. The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement. The CBRT formulates monetary policy by taking the medium-term inflation into account, thus focusing on the developments in underlying inflation rather than the anticipated fluctuations driven by the base effects during the course of the year. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and further monetary tightening will be delivered if needed.
18. Developments in fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance for the upcoming period is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices and taxes. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
19. In recent years, sustained fiscal discipline has been one of key factors in lowering the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks. The room provided by fiscal discipline facilitated the implementation of expansionary fiscal policy. Structural measures to provide room for counter-cyclical fiscal policies will enhance the coordination of monetary and fiscal policy, and improve macroeconomic stability."

2017,1 November 2017,SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING,"No: 2017-40
1 November 2017
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 26 October 2017
Inflation Developments
1. In September, consumer prices were up 0.65 percent and annual inflation rose by 0.52 points to 11.20 percent. Annual inflation recorded a decline in the energy group due to the base effect, but increased in other subgroups. Food inflation increased due to the negative base effect in the unprocessed food group coupled with the spike in the processed food prices. Core goods and services groups witnessed overall price hikes, while the rise in the clothing group is mainly attributed to the methodological change in the weighting system. These developments pushed both the annual inflation and the underlying trend of core indicators higher.
2. Annual inflation in food and nonalcoholic beverages increased by 0.53 points to 12.50 percent in September. Both unprocessed and processed food prices recorded higher annual inflation rates. While this outlook on unprocessed food inflation was triggered by the base effect, the red meat prices are decreasing amid the measures in effect and seasonally-adjusted unprocessed food prices have been on the decline for the last three months. Leading indicators for October hint at a sustained downtrend in unprocessed food prices. On the energy front, prices jumped in September amid price developments in oil and other inputs, and this trend continued in October.
3. Prices of services rose by 1.04 percent and the annual services inflation reached 9.55 percent in September. Price hikes spread across subgroups, and particularly striking were those in accommodation services and rent. Largely indexed to headline inflation, prices of educational services increased at a high rate in September as in August. Climbing inflation in services was driven both by increased costs and indexation to past inflation besides the robust course of economic activity.
4. Annual core goods inflation increased by 1.62 points to 12.70 percent in September. All subgroups, chiefly the clothing group saw higher annual inflation in this period. The recent upward course of core goods inflation was led by the lagged effects of the exchange rate, the strong course of economic activity and the clothing-driven methodological effects. The change in the weighting structure in clothing was mostly manifested itself in this period and accounted for nearly half of the rise in annual inflation in core indicators. Among durable goods, price hikes were more prevalent in automobiles and home appliances, and monthly price increases in core goods excluding clothing and durable goods gained momentum. Indicators for October hint at an ongoing uptrend in core goods inflation. The termination of the temporary tax reductions in white goods and furniture sector will also have a role in this uptrend. In addition, the weight update for clothing prices may still put upward pressure in October, albeit to a lesser degree.
5. In sum, current elevated levels of inflation and the developments on core inflation outlook continue to pose risks on the pricing behavior.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6. Recently released data indicate a strong economic activity. July-August data on industrial production and September’s survey indicators suggest that industrial activity remains strong yet somewhat slower than in the second quarter. As growth becomes more widespread across sectors, indicators for services and trade have also recorded substantial gains; the recovery in the tourism sector helped boost the economic activity, as well.
7. A similar outlook is also evident in demand indicators. Private consumption props up growth, while machinery and equipment investments have been increasingly displaying signs of recovery following a long spell of weak growth. Domestic demand is expected to provide added support to growth in the third quarter. The Committee reiterated that annual growth will be much faster in the third quarter owing to strengthening economic activity as well as calendar and base effects.
8. The improving growth outlook across the globe, particularly for the EU, and Turkey’s flexibility to shift markets abroad continue to stimulate exports. Despite that a slight deterioration in the current account deficit is expected in the next few months due to the recovery in domestic demand and base effects, the strong recovery in tourism and the uptrend in exports of goods is envisaged to contribute further to the current account balance.
9. The labor market improvement halted in July. In this period, construction employment increased whereas employment in industry and service sectors dropped compared to the previous period. Thus, despite the strong economy-wide growth, the labor market displayed only a partial recovery. Survey data suggest that the weak July outlook was only temporary. Still, the Committee noted that employment gains failed to fully pass through to unemployment rates due to the strong upward trend in the labor force participation rate.
10. In short, economic activity was robust in the third quarter. Domestic demand conditions keep improving and the improving external demand, primarily from European Union economies, continues to contribute positively to exports. The Committee assesses that the implementation of structural reforms would contribute to potential growth significantly.
Monetary Policy and Risks
11. The global economic upturn is expected to continue in the rest of 2017 and throughout 2018. Although financial market volatility slightly increased in the third quarter, global financial conditions remain accommodative as the risk appetite is still strong. Despite the third quarter’s higher crude oil prices driven by the benign global growth outlook, the OPEC output cut and the hurricanes that hit the US oil production, demand and supply-side factors specific to the oil market are containing the upward pressures on energy prices. On the other hand, risks related to other commodity prices are on the upside due to the global growth outlook.
12. The primary downside risk to the global economic outlook is the uncertainty surrounding monetary policy normalization across advanced economies. The communication after the September meeting reinforced financial market expectations that the Fed will stick to its previously announced path of normalization. The Fed started reducing the size of its balance sheet in October. If the impending balance sheet downsizing of the Fed and other major central banks is introduced faster than expected, the high risk appetite and low volatility cycle in financial markets may be reversed. In addition to these uncertainties regarding global economic policies, the lack of a clear-cut Brexit strategy, the tendency towards more inward-oriented policies in European economies and the ongoing geopolitical turmoil in Asia and the Middle East stand out as other upcoming downside risks to financial markets and global growth. The fact that the size of private sector debt has reached high levels across some emerging economies, with China in the lead, might aggravate the impact of the risks related to financial markets.
13. The favorable global economic outlook and trade volume as well as the ongoing global risk appetite prompted an upturn in portfolio flows toward emerging economies recently, but heightened geopolitical risks caused portfolio investments to lose momentum in Turkey. Turkey’s portfolio inflows have been more concentrated in government bonds since September whereas flows to the stock market remained volatile and weak. The volatility in the foreign exchange market triggered a rise in long-term inflation compensation. Despite these developments, financial conditions remained mostly accommodative in the third quarter. Loan growth balanced at historical levels in the third quarter, as the loans guaranteed by the Credit Guarantee Fund almost reached the pre-determined upper limit. The strong acceleration of credit growth in the first half of the year and its phase-out in the second half are monitored closely with regard to their impact on aggregate demand and economic activity.
14. The third quarter’s economic activity and aggregate demand were mostly in line with the predictions of the previous Report. After the third quarter, domestic demand might see some slowdown due to the reduced support of the additional credit boost to growth and the termination of tax incentives for durable goods, and the economy is expected to move towards its underlying trend. Both the subsiding effect of the accommodative policies of 2017 and the fiscal measures announced in the recent Medium Term Program (MTP) are monitored closely with respect to their effect on economic activity. The continued recovery in tourism, the improving global growth outlook and the favorable course of the real exchange rate are expected to contribute further to growth and the current account balance in the coming months through the export channel. The improving perceptions regarding uncertainty will continue to bolster investment in the next quarter, as in the third quarter. As the recovery becomes widespread, it is expected that favorable tendency will take place in employment and investment, upholding economic growth. Against this background, uncertainties over monetary policies of major central banks, the course of capital flows and geopolitical developments remain key to economic activity. Exchange rate volatility that may arise from such factors poses a downside risk to the timing and strength of the support that financial conditions could provide to the economic activity.
15. The Committee evaluated the medium-term projections to be presented in the final Inflation Report of the year. Accordingly, year-end inflation forecast was revised upwards by 1.1 points for 2017, and 0.6 points for 2018, compared to the 2017 July Inflation Report. Given a tight policy stance that focuses on bringing inflation down, inflation is estimated to converge gradually to the 5-percent target. Accordingly, inflation is likely to be 9.8 percent at end-2017, and stabilize around 5 percent in the medium term after falling to 7 percent by the end of 2018.
16. Following the July Inflation Report, the rise in commodity prices, particularly for oil and metals, and exchange rate changes drove inflation higher through the cost channel, causing core inflation indicators to exceed forecasts. Inflation is expected to remain high in October and November before coming down markedly to a still elevated level in December amid base effects. Base effects from food prices, the termination of temporary tax cuts for home appliances and furniture in October and the methodology change for clothing are the factors that will cause inflation to fluctuate in the short term and core inflation to rise briefly. The inflation outlook is expected to improve gradually from December onwards.
17. The current elevated levels of inflation and developments in core inflation indicators continue to pose risks to the pricing behavior. These risks and the high levels of inflation expectations might dampen the expected improvement in the inflation outlook from December through the first months of 2018. The fact that inflation expectations and the pricing behavior show no sign of improvement jeopardizes the inflation outlook. All these developments necessitate the maintaining of the tight monetary policy stance.
18. Against this background, the Committee decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance in its October meeting and kept the Late Liquidity Window lending rate constant at 12.25 percent. The Committee strengthened gradually the caution level of its monetary stance with the communication conducted in September and October.
19. The tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained until the inflation outlook displays a significant improvement and becomes consistent with the targets. Accordingly, the monetary policy will aim to bring inflation down to 7 percent at end-2018 before gradually falling to 5 percent. Consequently, with the current reading of the data, this stance requires that the tight monetary policy be preserved until a convincing fall in the trend of inflation is reached. The CBRT formulates monetary policy by taking the medium-term inflation into account, thus focusing on the developments in underlying inflation rather than the anticipated fluctuations driven by the base effects during the course of the year. Inflation expectations, pricing behaviors and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and further monetary tightening will be delivered if needed. The Committee will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective.
20. Developments in fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices and taxes. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
21. In recent years, sustaining fiscal discipline has been one of the key factors in lowering the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks. The room provided by fiscal discipline facilitated the implementation of an expansionary fiscal policy. Structural measures to provide room for counter-cyclical fiscal policies will enhance the coordination of monetary and fiscal policy, and improve macroeconomic stability."

Press Release on Rediscount Credits for Export and Foreign Exchange Earning Services
In the recent period, the markets have witnessed unsound price formations that are inconsistent with economic fundamentals.
Taking this development into account, it has been decided that the repayments of rediscount credits for export and foreign exchange earning services, which will be due by 1 February 2018 (included), can be made in Turkish liras at an exchange rate of 3.7000 for the USD, 4.3000 for the Euro, and 4.8000 for the GBP, provided that they are paid at maturity. In case the exchange rate on the date of credit extension is higher than these rates, the exchange rate on the date of credit extension will be applicable.

DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
 
Participating Committee Members
Murat Çetinkaya (Governor), Ömer Duman, Erkan Kilimci, Emrah Şener, Murat Uysal, Abdullah Yavaş.
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates at the following levels:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been kept at 9.25 percent and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.25 percent,
b) One-week repo rate has been kept at 8 percent,
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, while lending rate has been increased from 12.25 percent to 12.75 percent.
During year 2017, aggregate demand conditions have displayed a strong course and credit has shown rapid growth. Recently released data indicate that economic activity maintains its strength. Domestic demand conditions keep improving and external demand continues to contribute positively to exports.
Current elevated levels of inflation and recent developments in cost factors have increased the risks on expectations and the pricing behavior. Accordingly, the Committee decided to tighten the monetary policy stance.
The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement and becomes consistent with the targets. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
2017,21 December 2017,SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING,"No: 2017-47
21 December 2017
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 14 December 2017
Inflation Developments
1. In November, consumer prices rose by 1.49 percent and annual inflation increased by 1.08 points to 12.98 percent. Annual inflation recorded some decline in the services group, but increased in other subgroups. Food inflation increased due to the unprocessed food group, while the core goods and energy groups witnessed the adverse effects of exchange rate developments. Against these developments, annual inflation in core indicators increased due to the core goods group, and the underlying trend remained high.
2. In November, annual inflation in food and nonalcoholic beverages increased by 3.04 points to 15.78 percent in November. The rise in annual inflation was largely driven by unprocessed food prices, while processed food prices also continued to rise at higher rates. Unlike the decline in meat prices, the negative outlook in the vegetables group drove notably upwards the seasonally adjusted unprocessed food prices. Meanwhile, the processed food group saw sustained price increases in cheese and other dairy products. Leading indicators for December hint at a downtrend in the annual food inflation to be led by unprocessed food prices. On the energy front, prices soared further in November amid exchange rate developments coupled with the prices of oil and other inputs.
3. Prices of services inched up by 0.11 percent in November and the annual services inflation has declined for the first time since the start of the year to 9.42 percent. Monthly price increases accelerated to some extent in rent, and remained mild in other subgroups. This period was particularly marked by falling prices in transport services as well as package tours under other services.
4. Annual core goods inflation increased by 0.74 points and reached 15.05 percent in November. Annual inflation followed a flat course in the clothing group but increased in other subgroups. Durable goods saw further monthly price hikes, chiefly in automobiles, white goods and other electrical appliances. Meanwhile, monthly price increases in core goods excluding clothing and durable goods gained momentum. The recent hike in core goods inflation was mostly driven by exchange rate developments and was also stimulated by the robust course of demand conditions.
5. In sum, current elevated levels of inflation and the recent cost developments continue to pose risks on expectations and the pricing behavior.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6. The GDP expanded by 11.1 percent in the third quarter of 2017 in annual terms, and the quarterly growth became 1.2 percent. In addition to the course of economic activity, this tremendous expansion in annual growth is also attributed to calendar and base effects. The main driver of annual and quarterly growth proved to be domestic demand led by machinery-equipment investments and private consumption in the third quarter. The rebound in tourism and the robust course of exports of goods notwithstanding, the sharp increase in gold imports limited the contribution of net exports to annual growth in this period.
7. Recently released data indicate a strong economic activity. Industrial production in October recorded an increase compared both to the previous month and the average of the third quarter. Activity in sectors subject to tax incentives, chiefly the furniture sector, displayed a slowdown, yet other sectors did not record a loss of momentum. In fact, survey indicators hint at a sustained uptrend in industrial production in the fourth quarter, albeit with some deceleration. Indicators for services and trade stood moderate, while the recovery in the tourism sector spurs economic activity further.
8. Domestic demand conditions keep improving. In the fourth quarter, private consumption growth is expected to lose some pace following the withdrawal of tax reductions in white goods and furniture. On the other hand, current indicators show that the third-quarter improvement in machinery-equipment investments continues.
9. The improving growth outlook across the globe, particularly for the EU, and Turkey’s flexibility to shift markets abroad continue to stimulate exports. The rise in exports of goods slows the deterioration in the current account deficit and improves the core current account deficit indicators. In addition to the expected recovery in tourism, the uptrend in exports of goods is envisaged to contribute further to the balance. The Committee noted that the contribution of net exports to growth will continue in the fourth quarter amid the strong course of exports.
10. The recovery in the labor market continued in the September period. Employment increased in services, but receded in industry and construction compared to the previous period. Survey data suggest that the labor market will improve further in the last quarter. The Committee highlighted that employment gains failed to fully pass through to unemployment rates due to the strong uptrend in the labor force participation rate. Against this background, the unemployment rate is anticipated to decline gradually in the period ahead.
11. In sum, economic activity recorded a robust growth in the third quarter. Recently released data indicate that economic activity maintains its strength. Domestic demand conditions keep improving and external demand continues to contribute positively to exports.
Monetary Policy and Risks
12. Third-quarter data on global growth hint at continued simultaneous recovery in both advanced and emerging economies. PMI indicators pointing to growth for both markets and the upgraded growth forecasts for 2017 and 2018 compared to the start of 2017 confirm the steady economic rebound across the globe. Global inflation remains stable.
13. The primary downside risk to the global economic outlook over the upcoming period is the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and the Korean peninsula and the heightened protectionism clouding international trade negotiations. Moreover, the imminent passing of the US tax reform bill is considered a positive risk factor for the world economy. Although oil prices that gained following the OPEC’s recent extension of the output cut decision seem to be the main threat to the steady global inflation, this upward tendency has been contained by the oil production increase in the US.
14. With the Federal Reserve and the ECB in the lead, major central banks continue to normalize monetary policy. As the steps towards normalization have been in line with expectations, the market reaction is currently mild. However, risks to the US interest rates are on the upside. The imminent tax reform fuels upbeat prospects for the US stock market, yet if this bill leads to a bigger budget deficit, the US Treasury bond rates might increase faster than expected.
15. The favorable global economic outlook and trade volume as well as the ongoing global risk appetite drive strong portfolio flows into emerging economies. Having lost some momentum after mid-September, portfolio investments to Turkey have been picking up again recently amid reduced geopolitical risks. As the loans guaranteed by the Credit Guarantee Fund hit the pre-determined upper limit, the loan growth hovers around historical averages. The strong acceleration of loan growth in the first half of the year and its phase-out in the second half are monitored closely with regard to their impact on aggregate demand and economic activity.
16. The third quarter’s economic activity and aggregate demand were mostly in line with predictions. In the fourth quarter, domestic demand might see some slowdown due to the reduced support of the additional credit boost to growth and the withdrawal of tax incentives for durable goods, and economic growth is expected to move towards its underlying trend. The continued recovery in tourism, the improving global growth outlook and the favorable course of the real exchange rate are expected to contribute further to growth and the current account balance in the coming months through the export channel.
17. Against this background, uncertainties over monetary policies of major central banks, the course of capital flows and geopolitical developments remain key to economic activity. Exchange rate volatility that may arise from such factors poses a downside risk to the timing and strength of the support that financial conditions could provide to economic activity. In this regard, the contractionary pressure of the recent Turkish lira depreciation on domestic demand might be partly offset by the export channel.
18. The rise in commodity prices, particularly for oil and metals, and exchange rate changes have recently driven inflation higher through the cost channel. Amid robust economic activity, cost pressures had a much larger effect on inflation. Consumer inflation is expected to come down markedly due to base effects but remain high in December.
19. The current elevated levels of inflation and developments in core inflation indicators continue to pose risks to the pricing behavior. These risks and the high levels of inflation expectations might dampen the expected improvement in the inflation outlook from December through the first months of 2018. The fact that inflation expectations and the pricing behavior show no sign of improvement jeopardizes the inflation outlook.
20. Accordingly, the Committee decided to tighten the monetary policy stance. First of all, as of 22 November 2017, all CBRT funding have been made through the Late Liquidity Window (LON) and the weighted average funding cost is raised by about 25 basis points to 12.25 percent. Moreover, at its December meeting, the Committee decided to increase the LON lending rate from 12.25 to 12.75 percent.
21. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement and becomes consistent with the targets. The CBRT formulates monetary policy by taking the medium-term inflation into account, thus focusing on the developments in underlying inflation rather than the anticipated fluctuations driven by the base effects during the course of the year. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered.
22. Developments in fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices and taxes. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
23. In recent years, sustaining fiscal discipline has been one of the key factors in lowering the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks. The room provided by fiscal discipline facilitated the implementation of an expansionary fiscal policy. Structural measures to provide room for counter-cyclical fiscal policies will enhance the coordination of monetary and fiscal policy, and improve macroeconomic stability. Moreover, continuation of structural steps to reduce inertia and volatility in inflation will contribute positively to the price stability process and social welfare."

Press Release on the Maximum Interest Rates for Credit Cards in Q1 2018 
The maximum interest rates that banks can charge on credit card borrowing in the first quarter of 2018 have been left unchanged.
Banks in Turkey, as is the case in other countries, charge higher interest rates for credit card borrowing than they do for consumer loans. The CBRT, therefore, advises credit card holders with short-term credit needs to seek a consumer loan rather than borrowing on personal credit cards.

Press Release on FX Collateral Deposit Limits
As stated in the paragraph 20 of the Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2016 document published on December 9th 2015; “Changes made to the guidelines for the use of FX deposits as collateral have somewhat lowered banks’ need for swap deals with the market. Banks’ need for swaps can be further reduced through a rise in the use of this option and in the limits allotted to banks”.
Accordingly, FX deposit limits are increased from 3 billion USD to 3,6 billion USD and from 900 million EUR to 1,8 billion EUR as of 7 January 2016.
Any further revisions of the FX deposit limits will be announced one business day before the implementation date, on the pages of Anadolu Ajansı DV006, Reuters CBTJ and Bloomberg CBT.

Press Release on the Coverage of Reserve Requirements
Development and investment banks’ borrower funds will be subject to reserve requirements and reserve requirement ratios (RRRs) for these liabilities will be 11.5% for Turkish lira and 13% for FX liabilities. 
Additionally, it has been decided that deposits/participation funds obtained from banks abroad will be subject to the RRRs of other liabilities except deposits/participation funds, since these liabilities are regarded as non-core liabilities.
These amendments will be effective as of the calculation date of 12 February 2016 and the corresponding maintenance period starting from 26 February 2016.

As stated in the paragraph 20 of the Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2016 document published on December 9th 2015, “The increase in the ratio of the FX collateral that can be pledged by banks within the CBRT against their borrowings from the CBRT Interbank Money Market is expected to boost the demand for FX-denominated bonds issued abroad by the Treasury. This arrangement is expected to play a stabilizing role against the stress likely to be experienced in credit risk pricing due to global factors.”
Accordingly, the maximum ratio of 50 percent that banks are able to pledge as FX denominated collateral against their borrowings at the CBRT Interbank Money Market are raised to 70 percent as of 13 January 2016.
This ratio will be calibrated further, when deemed necessary, based on future developments in the global market conditions.

DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Participating Committee Members
Erdem Başçı (Governor), Ahmet Faruk Aysan, Murat Çetinkaya, Turalay Kenç, Necati Şahin, Abdullah Yavaş, Mehmet Yörükoğlu. 
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels:
a)    Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 10.75 percent, and borrowing rate at 7.25 percent,
b)    One-week repo rate at 7.5 percent,
c)    Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.25 percent.
Annual loan growth continues at reasonable rates in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. Demand from the European Union economies continues to support exports, despite elevated geopolitical risks in other export markets. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the announced structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly.
Energy price developments affect inflation favorably, while other cost factors limit the improvement in the core indicators. Considering the wage developments and the impact of the uncertainty in global markets on inflation expectations and pricing behavior and taking into account the volatility in energy and unprocessed food prices, the Committee stated that the tight liquidity stance will be maintained as long as deemed necessary.
Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained.

26 January 2016
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 19 January 2016
     
Inflation Developments

1.    In December, consumer prices edged up by 0.21 percent, and annual inflation rose by 0.71 points to 8.81 percent. This rise in inflation is attributed to the increase in unprocessed food prices and the base effect in energy prices. Core goods inflation continued to rise, and services inflation maintained its high level. Thus, annual inflation of core indicators recorded an increase, while its underlying trend improved slightly.
2.    Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 1.35 points to 10.87 percent. This was driven by the rising prices of vegetables, and the annual rate of price increases reached 23.32 percent in this sub-group. Thus, unprocessed food inflation climbed to 13.83 percent, maintaining its high course of the last two years. On the processed food front, annual inflation increased to 8.33 percent due particularly to the price developments in oils and bread-cereals groups. Leading indicators for January suggest a persisting high course in food inflation.
3.    On the energy front, despite a monthly decline by 0.22 percent in prices, annual inflation climbed to 2.96 percent due to the base effect in December. In January, the fall in oil prices notwithstanding, energy inflation is expected to increase further owing both to the low base in 2015 and the adjustment in electricity prices. In addition to the adjustment in electricity prices, adjustments introduced to some items with administered prices like tobacco and alcoholic drinks in early January will have a direct effect on inflation close to 0.7 point.
4.    Prices of services increased by 0.22 percent, and annual services inflation slightly increased to 8.85 percent in the last month of the year. Thus, prices of services claimed the highest year-end increase since 2008. Food prices affected services inflation adversely through the catering services channel across the year, leading the restaurants-hotels group to register the highest increase, 13.23 percent, within the sub-groups. Meanwhile, the cumulative depreciation in the exchange rate coupled with the course of the headline inflation and the effects of wage developments stood out as other factors for the high course of services inflation. On the other hand, slowing oil prices curbed services inflation through transport services.
5.    Annual core goods inflation rose by 0.61 points to 10.22 percent in December. Annual inflation followed a flat course in durable goods, but recorded increases in other sub-groups. The cumulative depreciation in the Turkish lira continued to affect core goods, albeit with some slowdown. Clothing inflation remained on the rise, and annual inflation in this group rose by around 4.7 points to 9 percent in the last three-month-period. Seasonally-adjusted data indicated a decrease in the underlying trend of core goods inflation in December.
6.    In sum, international energy prices continue to affect inflation favorably. On the other hand, other cost factors limit the improvement in the core inflation trend.

Factors Affecting Inflation 

7.    Industrial production recorded a month-on-month decline in November, yet the October-November average of the index stood above the third-quarter level. Among the BTS order indicators of the last three months, the domestic market orders registered a recovery, while the export orders declined. The Headline PMI and PMI production indices recorded an increase in December, following the increase in November, and remained above the stationary level. Despite the decline in December, consumer confidence indices stood above the level in October. The investor confidence also increased moderately in December. Against this background, industrial production is expected to register an increase on a monthly basis in December.
8.    Data on the expenditure side suggest a milder course of private demand growth in the last quarter of 2015 relative to the third quarter. In the October-November period, production and imports of consumption goods registered a decline compared to the average of the previous quarter. Sales of white goods and automobiles trended downwards as well. Among indicators of investment, production of capital goods increased further in the October-November period, yet the imports receded. Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products and sales of heavy commercial vehicles, which are among the indicators for construction investment, registered a decline.
9.    Favorable developments in the terms of trade accompanied by the moderate course of consumer loans support the recovery in the current account balance. Demand from the European Union economies continues to support exports, despite elevated geopolitical risks in other export markets. The trend of recovery in the European economy, which is a significant trading partner of Turkey, continued in the last quarter of 2015. In addition to the recovery trend in the Euro area, high market-shifting flexibility supports exports. Accordingly, improvement in the current account balance is expected to continue with the support of increased demand from the EU countries, low course of commodity prices, and ongoing macroprudential policy measures.
10.    In October 2015, unemployment rates registered a month-on-month increase. Labor force in non-farm sectors grew more than employment in this period. Industrial employment increased, while construction employment remained unchanged. Services employment, on the other hand, displayed a slight decline. Industrial production and survey indicators signal an increase in employment in the upcoming period. Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products hints at no additional revival in the construction sector. In the services sector, employment data in sub-sectors follow a fluctuating course. Accordingly, unemployment rates in the last quarter are expected to remain close to those of the third quarter.
11.    To sum up, recent indicators suggest that growth in economic activity will continue in the last quarter of 2015, albeit at a slower pace. Despite the downside risk due to geopolitical developments, the recovery in the European economies continues to positively contribute to external demand. In the upcoming period, domestic demand is likely to be supported by the income channel through wage increases and the low course of oil prices, and by the confidence channel through waning domestic uncertainties. Hence, growth in economic activity is expected to continue.

Monetary Policy and Risks 

12.    The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) discussed the medium-term projections to be published in the January Inflation Report.  Inflation in the last quarter of 2015 exceeded the projections of the October Inflation Report mainly due to unprocessed food prices. However, inflation excluding unprocessed food and tobacco was close to the October forecast in this period. Core inflation remained high due to the lagged effects of the cumulative depreciation in the Turkish lira, yet the ongoing fall in import prices in the fourth quarter limited the rise in CPI inflation. Evaluating assumptions underlying the inflation forecasts and the course of exogenous variables, an upward revision was made to the end-2016 inflation forecast, in consideration of the effects of the revisions in the Turkish lira-denominated import and oil prices, administered price adjustments announced in January and minimum wage arrangements.
13.    Energy price developments continue to affect inflation favorably, while other cost factors limit the improvement in the core inflation trend. Food prices remain volatile due mainly to the unprocessed food group. Lagged effects of the depreciation in the Turkish lira are evident particularly on the core goods inflation. Moreover, as the minimum-wage adjustment passes through to overall wages, cost and demand pressures on inflation stemming from wages are likely to increase in the upcoming period. Accordingly, core inflation indicators are expected to remain high for a while. The effect of the above-target inflation on expectations and the acceleration in wage increases require the pricing behavior regarding the overall economy to be monitored closely. In this respect, considering the impact of wage developments and the uncertainties in global markets on inflation expectations and pricing behavior, and taking into account the volatility in energy and unprocessed food prices, the Committee stated that the tight liquidity stance will be maintained as long as deemed necessary. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained. 
14.    Annual loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The recent growth trend of loans reveals that both consumer and commercial loans remained below historical averages; consumer loans throughout 2015, commercial loans only in the second half of the year. Recent arrangements in risk weights and minimum wages are considered to boost loan growth through the loan supply and household income channels. On the other hand, the ongoing tightness in financial conditions is likely to keep the annual loan growth rates at reasonable levels. With respect to the composition of loans, commercial loans continue to grow faster than consumer loans. Such a composition not only limits medium-term inflationary pressures but also supports the improvement in the current account balance.
15.    In the upcoming period, it is envisaged that the domestic demand will provide a slightly larger contribution to growth and the rising demand from the European Union countries will continue to improve exports. The recovery in the investor and consumer confidence led by waning domestic uncertainties, the room for spending amid the fall in oil prices and the effects of the recent wage developments on the purchasing power are projected to boost domestic demand. Persisting global volatilities and the tightness in financial conditions stand out as the factors that limit the domestic demand increase. On the foreign demand front, geopolitical developments pose a downside risk, yet the trend of rebound in the European economy coupled with the market-shifting flexibility of our exports cap this risk. In fact, exports towards the European Union countries have recently recorded a remarkable acceleration. Moreover, improvements in the terms of trade mainly led by the sharp fall in commodity prices, accompanied by the sluggish course of consumer loans support the improvement in the current account balance. Accordingly, the current account deficit is expected to decline further in the upcoming period.
16.    Uncertainties surrounding global monetary policies and concerns over global growth cause financial markets to remain volatile. Thus, portfolio flows to emerging economies and risk indicators follow a highly volatile pattern. Exchange rates also display a quite fluctuating course. The Committee believes that the policy tools placed in the road map announced in August 2015 strengthen the resilience of the economy against global shocks.
17.    In the upcoming period, both global and domestic volatilities will be monitored closely and required measures will continue to be taken.  In this context, related departments presented information to the Committee on the foreign exchange liquidity instruments and methods that have been used since 18 August 2015 and that may be used in the upcoming periods and their effects. 
18.    In case the decline in loan growth rates becomes permanent and exchange rates continue to face upward pressure, the Committee, while preserving the tight monetary policy stance, may take measures to support the Turkish lira and loan growth by reconsidering the funding conditions for the use of foreign currency denominated collateral. 
19.    In this respect, the Committee stated that the policy stance will remain tight against the inflation outlook, stabilizing for the FX liquidity and supportive of the financial stability.
20.    The Committee stated that the wide interest rate corridor has contributed to containing exchange rate volatility in times of heightened global volatility. The need for such an instrument would be reduced, should the decline in global volatility prove persistent. Another factor reducing the need for a wide interest rate corridor is the effective use of policy instruments laid out in the road map published in August. Excessive fluctuations both in exchange rates and loans have waned owing to the launch and effective use of these instruments. The Committee’s assessment still prevails that the monetary policy may be implemented within a narrower and more standard interest rate corridor, should global volatilities see a permanent decline or the policy tools specified in the August road map permanently cap the effects of the global volatility on the Turkish economy.
21.    Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
22.    Sustained fiscal discipline has become a fundamental element in reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years. In the current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the value added from maintaining and further advancing these achievements is significant. Any measure that would ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels."

DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Participating Committee Members
Erdem Başçı (Governor), Ahmet Faruk Aysan, Murat Çetinkaya, Turalay Kenç, Necati Şahin, Abdullah Yavaş, Mehmet Yörükoğlu. 
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels:
a)    Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 10.75 percent, and borrowing rate at 7.25 percent,
b)    One-week repo rate at 7.5 percent,
c)    Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.25 percent.
Annual loan growth continues at reasonable rates in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. Demand from the European Union economies continues to support exports at an increasing pace, despite elevated geopolitical risks in other export markets. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the announced structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly.
Energy price developments affect inflation favorably, while other cost factors limit the improvement in the core indicators. Considering the wage developments and the impact of the uncertainty in global markets on inflation expectations and pricing behavior and taking into account the volatility in energy and unprocessed food prices, the Committee stated that the tight liquidity stance will be maintained as long as deemed necessary.
Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained. 
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

Press Release on the Maximum Interest Rates for Credit Cards in Q2 2016
The monthly maximum interest rates that banks can charge on credit card borrowing in the second quarter of 2016 have been left unchanged.
The CBRT sets maximum interest rates for credit card borrowing under legal authority expressed most recently in the CBRT Communiqué No. 2014/5 on Maximum Interest Rates to be Applied to Credit Card Transactions published in the Official Gazette No: 29153 dated 22 October 2014. Accordingly, to be effective from 1 April 2016, for the credit card borrowings, the monthly maximum contractual interest rate will be 2.02 percent for the Turkish lira and 1.62 percent for foreign exchange transactions, whereas the monthly maximum overdue interest rate will be 2.52 percent for the Turkish lira and 2.12 percent for foreign exchange transactions.
Banks are not allowed to charge higher interest rates than the rates announced by the CBRT for credit cards. Banks are free to determine their respective rates at their own discretion provided that they are below these ceilings. The maximum contractual and overdue interest rates for credit card transactions for the three-month period starting on 1 July 2016 will be announced by the CBRT prior to that date.
Banks in Turkey, as is the case in other countries, charge higher interest rates for credit card borrowing than they do for consumer loans. The CBRT therefore advises credit card holders with short-term credit needs to seek a consumer loan rather than borrowing on personal credit cards.

01 March 2016
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 23 February 2016
Inflation Developments
1.    In January, consumer prices edged up by 1.82 percent, and annual inflation rose by 0.77 points to 9.58 percent. This rise in inflation is attributed to the products with administered prices and unprocessed food prices. The total effect of adjustments in certain products with administered prices in early January amounted to 0.7 points, as projected. Core goods inflation continued to rise, and services inflation maintained its high level. Accordingly, annual inflation of core indicators recorded an increase, while their underlying trend improved slightly.
2.    Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 0.82 points to 11.69 percent. This was mainly driven by unprocessed food prices that increased due to the prices of fresh fruits and vegetables. Annual inflation reached 20.09 percent in this sub-group, while that in unprocessed food hit 15.33 percent. On the processed food front, annual inflation increased to 8.41 percent amid the price developments in bread-cereals group in the last two months. Leading indicators for February suggest a downtrend in food inflation.
3.    On the energy front, prices rose by 0.81 percent due to electricity prices, and annual inflation climbed to 4.61 percent. Annual energy inflation is envisaged to fall due to developments in oil prices coupled with the base effect in February. 
4.    Prices of services increased by 1.34 percent, and annual services inflation increased to 9.16 percent in January. Prices of services recorded the fastest monthly increase of the last ten years, and high increases spread across sub-groups. The gradually slowing price increases in the restaurants-hotels group amid the moderate course of meat prices in the last quarter of 2015 re-accelerated in January. In addition to wage developments and the high course of food inflation, accumulated exchange-rate pass through effects delay the fall in services inflation.
5.    Annual core goods inflation edged down by 0.12 points to 10.10 percent in January. Annual inflation decreased in durable goods, but maintained its uptrend in other sub-groups. Effects of the exchange rate continued with a dwindling pace in prices of core goods excluding clothing and durable goods, while the decline in clothing prices remained below seasonal averages. On the other hand, seasonally-adjusted indicators suggest an improvement in the underlying trend of core goods inflation in January.
6.    In sum, energy prices continue to affect inflation favorably, while other cost factors limit the improvement in the core inflation trend.
Factors Affecting Inflation  
7.    Industrial production recorded an increase in December compared to previous month. Quarterly production in the fourth quarter materialized above the third quarter. The headline PMI and the PMI production indices fell in January, despite staying above neutral levels. Business Tendency Survey data suggest that domestic orders registered an increase from the previous quarter’s average, while export orders were relatively weaker. Given these indicators as well as data on exports and imports, the pace of industrial production growth is expected to decelerate somewhat in January.
8.    Data on the expenditure side suggest a milder course of private demand growth in the final quarter of 2015 relative to the third quarter. In this period, the production and imports of consumer goods were down from the previous quarter’s average. Among indicators of investment, the production of capital goods posted a modest fourth-quarter growth, whereas the imports receded. The production of non-metallic minerals and sales of heavy commercial vehicles, which are indicators for construction investments, registered an increase. Among indicators for the first quarter of 2016, auto sales remained subdued in January, while home appliance sales were up. Consumer confidence indices declined in January and February yet remained above the October level. Meanwhile, data on the investment tendency hint at a moderate growth. Against this background, private demand is expected to rise modestly in the first quarter of 2016.
9.    Favorable developments in the terms of trade accompanied by the moderate course of consumer loans support the recovery in the current account balance. Despite heightened geopolitical risks, the growing EU demand continues to support exports. The recovery in Europe, one of Turkey’s major export markets, continued into January. Additionally, Turkey’s high market-shifting flexibility also supports exports. Thus, amid a continued EU demand growth, low commodity prices and ongoing macroprudential policies, the current account balance is likely to improve further in 2016, which, however, might be restrained by the likely fall in tourism revenues due to geopolitical developments.
10.    Unemployment rates were down month-on-month in November 2015. In this period, employment grew at a faster pace than labor force in nonfarm sectors. Across sub-sectors, the services provided the largest contribution to nonfarm employment growth. Industrial employment decreased marginally, whereas construction employment picked up. Industrial production and survey indicators signal no additional rebound for industrial employment over the upcoming period. The course of nonmetallic mineral production indicates a moderate growth in construction employment. Employment data for sub-sectors of services remain volatile. Leading indicators for the labor market suggest that unemployment rates will remain flat over the coming months.
11.    In conclusion, recent indicators suggest that the economy continues to grow at a moderate pace. In the upcoming period, domestic demand is likely to be supported by the income channel through wage increases and low oil prices. Although geopolitical tensions pose a downside risk, demand from the European Union economies continues to support exports at an increasing pace.
Monetary Policy and Risks
12.    Although energy price developments continue to affect inflation favorably, other cost factors limit the improvement in the core inflation trend. Meanwhile, food prices remain volatile largely due to unprocessed food prices. Leading indicators point to a likely downward correction in unprocessed food prices in the short term. Moreover, the waning of the lagged pass-through effects of cumulative exchange rate movements might contribute to disinflation in coming months. Against this backdrop, the Committee expects the disinflation to resume by February. Yet, developments in both wages and inflation expectations pose an upside risk to the core inflation outlook. Thus, core inflation indicators are likely to remain elevated for some time. The adverse impact of the above-target inflation on inflation expectations and the acceleration in wage increases necessitates a close monitoring of the overall pricing behavior. Therefore, the current tight monetary stance should be maintained in order for the impending disinflation to be permanent. Against this backdrop, considering the impact of wage developments and the uncertainties in global markets on inflation expectations and the pricing behavior, and taking into account the volatility in energy and unprocessed food prices, the Committee stated that the tight liquidity stance will be maintained as long as deemed necessary. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained.
13.    Annual loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. Recent data point to no major change in the underlying trend of loans. Adjustments in risk weights and minimum wages are considered to support loan growth through the loan supply and household income channels. Yet, the ongoing financial tightening is likely to keep annual loan growth rates at reasonable levels. With respect to the composition of loans, commercial loans continue to grow faster than consumer loans. Such a composition not only limits medium-term inflationary pressures but also supports the improvement in the current account balance.
14.    Leading data indicate that domestic demand has slowed somewhat as of mid-2015 but continues to contribute to growth modestly. The financial tightening due to persisting global volatility dampens domestic demand growth, whereas energy prices and wage developments bolster domestic demand through the income channel. On the foreign demand front, geopolitical developments pose a downside risk, yet the European economic recovery and the market-shifting flexibility of Turkish exports offset this risk. In fact, the favorable effect of the growing EU demand on exports has become more significant recently. Moreover, improvements in the terms of trade mainly led by the cumulative fall in commodity prices, coupled with the modest course of consumer loans, support the improvement in the current account balance. Overall, economic activity is expected to remain on a moderate growth path while the current account deficit is expected to narrow further in the upcoming period.
15.    The Committee assesses that the effective use of the policy tools announced in the road map of August 2015 strengthen the resilience of the economy against global shocks. This process is supported by a gradual reduction in demand for foreign exchange due to improved current account balance and lower energy prices. Meanwhile, foreign currency liquidity instruments are used to stabilize the value of the Turkish lira. In this context, foreign currency liquidity is provided through flexible foreign exchange sales auctions at amounts deemed necessary. 
16.    Nevertheless, uncertainties surrounding global monetary policies and concerns over global growth cause global markets to remain volatile. Emerging-market portfolio inflows and risk premiums follow a fluctuating pattern, while exchange rate volatilities remain elevated. In the forthcoming period, both global and domestic volatilities will be monitored closely and required measures in foreign exchange and Turkish lira markets will continue to be taken. In the case of sustained volatility, additional measures might be taken to support the Turkish lira by adjusting the funding conditions for the use of foreign currency denominated collateral, while maintaining the tight monetary policy stance.
17.    In this respect, the Committee stated that the policy stance will remain tight against the inflation outlook, stabilizing for the FX liquidity and supportive of the financial stability.
18.    The Committee stated that the wide interest rate corridor has contributed markedly to containing exchange rate volatility in times of heightened global volatility. The need for such an instrument would be reduced, should the decline in global volatility prove persistent. Another factor that may reduce the need for a wide interest rate corridor is the effective use of the policy instruments laid out in the road map published in August. Excessive fluctuations in both exchange rates and loans have waned owing to the launch and effective use of these instruments. The Committee still maintains the view that the monetary policy may be implemented within a narrower and more standard interest rate corridor, should global volatilities post a permanent decline or the policy tools of the August road map permanently contain the effects of the global volatility on the Turkish economy.
19.    Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
20.    Sustained fiscal discipline has become a fundamental element in reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years. In the current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the value added from maintaining and further advancing these achievements is significant. Any measure that would ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels."

Participating Committee Members
Erdem Başçı (Governor), Ahmet Faruk Aysan, Murat Çetinkaya, Turalay Kenç, Necati Şahin, Abdullah Yavaş, Mehmet Yörükoğlu. 
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows:
a)    Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been reduced from 10.75 percent to 10.5 percent, and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.25 percent,
b)    One-week repo rate has been kept at 7.5 percent,
c)    Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been reduced from 12.25 percent to 12 percent.
Annual loan growth continues at reasonable rates in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. Demand from the European Union economies continues to support exports at an increasing pace, despite elevated geopolitical risks in other export markets. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the announced structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly.
Recently, global volatility has eased to some extent. Moreover, with the use of the policy instruments laid out in the road map published in August 2015 effectively, the need for a wide interest rate corridor has been reduced. In this respect, the Committee decided to take a measured step towards simplification. However, improvement in the underlying core inflation trend remains limited, necessitating the maintenance of a tight liquidity stance.
Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained. 
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

31 March 2016
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 24 March 2016
Inflation Developments
1.    In February, consumer prices edged down by 0.02 percent, and annual inflation dropped by 0.80 points to 8.78 percent. The fall in inflation stemmed from unprocessed food and energy prices. Lagged effects of the exchange rate weakened further in this period. Annual inflation in core indicators recorded a slight increase, while the underlying trend continued to improve to a limited extent.
2.    Annual inflation in the food and non-alcoholic beverages group fell by 2.86 points to 8.83 percent. This was mainly driven by unprocessed food prices, the annual inflation of which decreased to 8.89 percent due to vegetable prices. On the processed food front, annual inflation sustained the uptrend amid the price developments in the bread-cereals group and hit 8.79 percent. Meanwhile, leading indicators suggest a notable decline in food inflation in March as well.
3.    On the energy front, prices fell by 0.56 percent due mainly to fuel prices, and annual inflation decreased to 2.85 percent. Annual energy inflation is envisaged to fall further due to the base effect in March. 
4.    Prices of services increased by 0.59 percent, and annual services inflation receded to 9.06 percent in February. Annual inflation decreased in the communication and restaurants-hotels groups, but increased in other subgroups. Annual inflation in the rent group hit the highest level of the last six years. The high course of inflation expectations and wage developments as well as lagged exchange rate pass-through effects delay the fall in services inflation.
5.    Annual core goods inflation edged up by 0.27 points to 10.37 percent in February. Annual inflation registered an increase across all subgroups. Annual inflation of durable consumption goods maintained high levels with 12 percent, and that of the clothing group hit 9.80 percent. Upward trend in core goods excluding clothing and durable goods continued. On the other hand, seasonally-adjusted indicators suggest a slowdown in the underlying trend of core goods inflation due to the dwindling effects of the cumulative depreciation in the Turkish lira.
6.    In sum, food and energy prices have affected inflation favorably, while other cost factors have limited the improvement in the core inflation trend recently.
Factors Affecting Inflation
7.    January industrial production increased by 1 percent month-on-month in seasonally adjusted terms, which was 1.3 percent above the previous quarter. Thus, the growth trend of 2015 was preserved in January. Survey indicators and external trade data suggest a similar pace of growth in February. 
8.    Data on the expenditure side suggest a modest course of private demand growth in the first quarter of 2016. The production of consumer goods was higher than the previous quarter's average in January. In addition, the sales of home appliances and automobiles picked up in February after a sluggish January. The uptrend across these industries is likely to continue into March. Survey-based indices for domestic orders also point to a continued moderate rise in domestic demand. Among indicators of investment, the production and imports of capital goods posted a small decline in January; yet the decline was mostly attributed to the vehicle industry and expected to be short-lived. The production of non-metallic minerals and the sales of heavy commercial vehicles, which are indicators for construction investments, registered a drop caused partly by adverse weather conditions. Meanwhile, the consumer confidence indices and the investment sentiment reveal that the contribution of the confidence channel to domestic demand is still limited. Against this background, private demand is expected to rise modestly in the first quarter of 2016.
9.    Favorable developments in the terms of trade accompanied by the moderate course of consumer loans support the recovery in the current account balance. The growing EU demand continues to support exports. Turkish exporters’ flexibility in shifting between markets contains the downside risks resulting from geopolitical tensions. Thus, amid an ongoing EU demand growth, low commodity prices and sustained macroprudential policies, the current account balance is likely to improve further. 
10.    Unemployment rates were down month-on-month in December 2015, largely due to growing nonfarm employment and lower labor force participation. Across sub-sectors, the services provided the largest contribution to nonfarm employment growth, while construction employment also increased. Industrial employment, on the other hand, edged down for the second month in a row in December. Production and survey indicators suggest that employment growth will maintain its moderate course in the short term. Accordingly, unemployment rates are expected to remain flat in the first quarter of 2016.
11.    In conclusion, recent indicators reveal that the economy continues to grow steadily as of the first quarter of 2016. Although geopolitical tensions pose a downside risk, the EU recovery affects external demand favorably. Wage increases and low oil prices support domestic demand through the income channel. Overall, economic activity remains on a moderate growth path.
Monetary Policy and Risks
12.    Annual loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The modest course of loans can be attributed to both supply and demand side factors. Adjustments in risk weights and minimum wages are considered to support loan growth in the forthcoming period through the loan supply and household income channels. Yet, indicators for the loan market still point to tight financial conditions, notwithstanding the recent fall in market rates and risk premiums. Therefore, loan growth rates are unlikely to post a significant recovery in the short run. With respect to the composition of loans, commercial loans continue to grow faster than consumer loans. Such a composition not only limits medium-term inflationary pressures but also supports the improvement in the current account balance.
13.    Recent data indicate that domestic demand continues to contribute to growth modestly albeit at a lesser extent compared to previous quarters. Ongoing tightness in financial conditions weighs on loan and domestic demand growth, whereas energy prices and wage developments provide support to domestic demand through the income channel. On the foreign demand front, geopolitical developments pose a downside risk, yet the economic recovery in Europe and the flexibility of exporters in shifting between markets offset this risk, which is conducive for both economic growth and rebalancing prospects. Moreover, improvements in the terms of trade mainly led by the cumulative fall in commodity prices, coupled with the modest course of consumer loans, support the improvement in the current account balance. On the other hand, the Committee noted that the recent developments in services exports pose downside risks on demand, employment, and the current account balance. Although this risk is not imminent at the moment, the developments should be monitored closely to have a clearer understanding of the implications for the medium-term outlook. Overall, the monetary policy stance is based on an outlook where economic activity will remain on a moderate growth path while the current account deficit will narrow further, albeit at a slower pace.
14.    The Committee assesses that the effective use of the policy tools announced in the road map of August 2015 bolster the resilience of the economy against global shocks. Excessive volatility in both credit and exchange rates has been dampened after the adoption of these new instruments. In fact, the relative volatility of the Turkish lira has decreased notably since September compared to other emerging market currencies. This process is supported by the gradually falling demand for foreign exchange amid the improving current account balance and lower energy prices. Meanwhile, foreign currency liquidity instruments are used to stabilize the value of the Turkish lira. All these developments reduce the need for a wide interest rate corridor to some degree.
15.    Another factor that has recently reduced the need for a wide interest rate corridor is the global economic and financial developments. Mounting prospects that global economic recovery will be slow have recently fostered the expectations of a prolonged period of low interest rates across advanced economies. Accordingly, capital flows into emerging economies increased while risk premiums fell significantly.
16.    In sum, global volatility has recently waned to some extent and the effective use of the policy instruments laid out in the road map of August 2015 have reduced the need for a wide interest rate corridor. In this respect, the Committee decided to take a measured step towards simplification by lowering the overnight lending rate by 25 basis points.
17.    However, improvement in the underlying core inflation trend remains limited, necessitating the maintenance of a tight liquidity stance. Although recent developments regarding imported input costs have eased the upside risks on the inflation outlook, the improvement in core inflation is still limited. Wage developments and the lagged pass-through effects of cumulative exchange rate movements restrain the improvement in the underlying trend of inflation. Annual inflation in food prices, which declined significantly in February, is likely to post another sharp fall in March. Yet, this will be mainly due to prices of vegetables, suggesting that food prices might remain volatile in the upcoming period. Against this background, the Committee stated that the current tight liquidity stance should be maintained in order to ensure that the recently observed disinflation process is long lasting.
18.    Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained. Moreover, global and domestic volatilities will be monitored closely and necessary measures will be undertaken in the foreign exchange and Turkish lira markets. In sum, the policy stance will remain tight against the inflation outlook, stabilizing for the FX liquidity and supportive of the financial stability.
19.    Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
20.    Sustained fiscal discipline has become a fundamental element in reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years. In the current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the value added from maintaining and further advancing these achievements is significant. Any measure that would ensure the sustainability of fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels."

DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Participating Committee Members
Murat Çetinkaya (Governor), Ahmet Faruk Aysan, Turalay Kenç, Necati Şahin, Abdullah Yavaş, Mehmet Yörükoğlu. 
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been reduced from 10.50 percent to 10 percent, and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.25 percent,
b) One-week repo rate has been kept at 7.5 percent,
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been reduced from 12 percent to 11.50 percent.
Annual loan growth continues at reasonable rates in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. Demand from the European Union economies continues to support exports at an increasing pace, despite elevated geopolitical risks in other export markets. Recent data and the leading indicators show that economic activity displays a moderate and stable course of growth. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly.
Recently, decline in the global volatility has continued and global financial conditions have improved. Along with these developments, the effective use of the policy instruments laid out in the road map published in August 2015 has reduced the need for a wide interest rate corridor. In this respect, the Committee decided to take a measured step towards simplification.
Recently, inflation displayed a marked decline, which was mainly due to unprocessed food prices. This decline is expected to continue in the short run. However, improvement in the underlying core inflation trend remains limited, necessitating the maintenance of a tight liquidity stance.
Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

2016,26 April 2016,SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING,"No: 2016-17
26 April 2016
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 20 April 2016     
Inflation Developments
1. In March, consumer prices edged down by 0.04 percent, and annual inflation dropped by 1.32 points to 7.46 percent. As also stated in the Summary of the March MPC Meeting, this fall in inflation stemmed from unprocessed food prices. In this period, annual inflation in core indicators recorded a slight fall, while the underlying trend continued to improve on the back of the core goods group.
2. Annual inflation in the food and non-alcoholic beverages group fell by 4.25 points to 4.58 percent. This was mainly driven by unprocessed food prices, the annual inflation of which plunged to 0.22 percent due to prices of fresh fruits and vegetables. On the processed food front, annual inflation sustained the uptrend due to the price developments in the bread-cereals group but with a diminishing pace.  Meanwhile, leading indicators hint at a notable decline in unprocessed food annual inflation in April as well. On the energy front, prices rose by 0.60 percent due mainly to international oil prices, while annual inflation decreased to 1.83 percent due to the base effect.
3. Prices of services increased by 0.38 percent, and the annual services inflation receded by 0.20 point to 8.86 percent in March. Annual inflation decreased in the other services and restaurants-hotels groups, but increased in remaining subgroups. The underlying trend of services prices remained at high levels, which is attributed to high levels of inflation expectations and the pricing behavior as well as increased costs amid wage developments and cumulative exchange rate effects.
4. Annual core goods inflation edged down by 0.24 points to 10.13 percent in March. Having increased since September, the annual clothing inflation recorded a decline in this period. Owing to the decelerating cumulative exchange rate effects, core goods excluding clothing saw a further decline in annual inflation, albeit limited. In addition, the recent stable course of the Turkish lira led to an improvement in the underlying trend of core goods inflation.
5. In sum, inflation has recently recorded a notable decline. Driven mainly by the unprocessed food group, this decline is expected to continue in the short term. Despite the fall in inflation, the Committee stated that the improvement in core inflation was limited.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6. According to the TurkStat, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rose by a quarterly 0.7 percent and a yearly 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015. Thus, the economy grew by 4.0 percent in 2015. On the production side, the industrial value-added made the greatest contribution to quarterly growth in the last quarter. Finance and insurance activities accounted for most of the services value-added over the year. Meanwhile, the noticeable agricultural value-added growth and rise in net taxes upon the increasing production of petroleum products made a significant contribution to growth throughout the year. On the expenditure side, investment spending was the main driver of final domestic demand in quarterly terms. In this period, consumer spending slowed and external demand declined. In sum, 2015 was marked as a year with faster private consumption growth than the GDP growth, recovering capital accumulation and contracted external demand.
7. Data for the first quarter of 2016 suggest that economic activity remains on the rise. Industrial production increased by 1.6 percent during January-February period relative to the previous quarter’s average. Given the external trade outlook and survey data for March, industrial production is expected to expand further in the first quarter.
8. Data on spending side point to a moderate domestic demand in the first quarter. Among indicators of private consumption, the production and imports of consumer goods rose in the January-February period. Likewise, sales of automobiles, home appliances, and homes were up. On the investment side, the production of capital goods dropped whereas their imports increased. Yet, the production of nonmetallic minerals expanded while their imports receded. Sales of commercial vehicles were also down in the first quarter. Accordingly, it is assessed that private consumer spending was more robust than investments, and private consumption was the main driver of domestic demand in the first quarter.
9. Favorable developments in the terms of trade accompanied by the moderate course of consumer loans support the recovery in the current account balance. The growing EU demand and Turkey’s high market-shifting flexibility limit downside risks caused by geopolitical developments. Thus, amid continued EU demand growth, low commodity prices, and ongoing macroprudential policies, the current account balance is expected to improve further.
10. Seasonally-adjusted unemployment rates were down on a month-on-month basis in January 2016, due to the increase in nonfarm employment and decline in labor supply. Across sub-sectors, services provided the largest contribution to nonfarm employment growth, while construction employment also increased. Industrial employment, on the other hand, was slightly down in January for the second month in a row. In view of production and survey indicators, employment is expected to remain on a modest track in the short term.
11. To sum up, current indicators suggest that the economy continues to grow at a steady and moderate pace. In the upcoming period, domestic demand is likely to be supported by the income channel through wage increases and low oil prices. Although geopolitical developments pose a downside risk, the growing EU demand continues to stimulate exports.
Monetary Policy and Risks
12. The Committee discussed the medium-term projections to be published in the April Inflation Report. In the first quarter of 2016, inflation remained below the projections of the January Inflation Report mainly due to unprocessed food prices. However, inflation excluding unprocessed food and tobacco was close to the January forecast in this period. Considering the assumptions underlying the forecasts and the course of exogenous variables, inflation forecasts for the upcoming period were left unchanged from the previous report. After the January Inflation Report, the Turkish lira remained stable while oil prices inched up and import prices edged down slightly. Accordingly, the impact of TL import prices was not significant enough to lead to any change in the inflation forecasts. Despite the recently slumping unprocessed food inflation, assumptions for food inflation are preserved given high volatility in food prices.
13. Annual loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. After slowing down in the fourth quarter of 2015, particularly for consumer loans, the growth trend of loans picked up in the first quarter of 2016. Risk weight and minimum wage arrangements and improving financial conditions are likely to boost loan growth in the upcoming period via loan supply and household income channels. Thus, annual loan growth rates are expected to remain at reasonable levels. With respect to the composition of loans, commercial loans continue to grow faster than consumer loans. This composition not only limits medium-term inflationary pressures but also supports the improvement in the current account balance.
14. Recent data and the leading indicators show that economic activity displays a moderate and stable course of growth. In the forthcoming period, domestic demand is likely to contribute more strongly to growth while the growing EU demand will further stimulate exports in spite of geopolitical risks. Strengthened investor and consumer confidence driven by reduced domestic uncertainties, recently improved financial conditions, robust post-global-crisis employment performance, and the early 2016 minimum wage hike are all expected to support domestic demand. On the foreign demand front, geopolitical developments and weaker global growth continue to pose downside risks, with those to exports of services recently being on the rise. Nevertheless, the economic recovery in Europe and the market-shifting flexibility of our exports cap these downside risks. In fact, the rising EU demand has had a favorable effect on exports recently, which is conducive for both economic growth and rebalancing prospects. Moreover, improvements in the terms of trade mainly led by the cumulative fall in commodity prices, coupled with the modest course of consumer loans, support the improvement in the current account balance. Against this background, the monetary policy stance is based on an outlook, where economic activity will remain on a moderate growth path while the current account deficit will narrow further, albeit at a slower pace.
15. The Committee assesses that the effective use of the policy tools announced in the road map of August 2015 bolsters the resilience of the economy against global shocks. The introduction of these new instruments helped to curb the excessive volatility in both exchange rates and credits. In fact, the relative volatility of the Turkish lira has decreased notably since September compared to other emerging market currencies. This process is supported by the gradually falling demand for foreign exchange amid the improving current account balance and lower energy prices. Also, foreign currency liquidity instruments are used to stabilize the value of the Turkish lira. All these developments alleviate the need for a wide interest rate corridor.
16. Other factors that have recently reduced the need for a wide interest rate corridor are the continued decline in global volatility and the improving global financial conditions. Mounting prospects of a slow global economic recovery and the sustained monetary easing by advanced economy central banks have recently fostered the expectations of a prolonged period of low interest rates across advanced economies. Accordingly, capital flows into emerging economies increased while risk premiums and market interest rates fell significantly.
17. In sum, the recent lasting decline in global volatility and the effective use of the policy instruments laid out in the road map announced in August 2015 have reduced the need for a wide interest rate corridor. Thus, the Committee decided to take a measured step towards simplification by lowering the marginal funding rate.
18. On the other hand, the improvement in the underlying core inflation trend remains limited, necessitating the maintenance of the tight liquidity policy stance. Although recent developments regarding imported input costs have eased the upside risks to the inflation outlook, the improvement in core inflation is still limited. The lagged effects of cumulative exchange rate movements, high levels of inflation expectations and wage developments restrain the improvement in the underlying trend of inflation. Food inflation has recently seen a marked decline on the back of unprocessed food prices. The falling food inflation led to a decrease in consumer inflation as well, which is expected to continue in the short run. Yet, given the high volatility in unprocessed food prices, it is important to remain cautious about the inflation outlook. Hence, the Committee stated that the current tight liquidity stance should be maintained in order to ensure that the recently observed disinflation becomes permanent.
19. In the upcoming period, monetary policy stance will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained. Moreover, global and domestic volatilities will be monitored closely and necessary measures will be taken for the foreign exchange and Turkish lira markets. In sum, the policy stance will remain tight against the inflation outlook, stabilizing for the FX liquidity and supportive of the financial stability.
20. Notwithstanding the significant external shocks in recent years, the current policy framework limited the worsening in inflation and inflation expectations. However, price stability is yet to be achieved. Ten years of experience with inflation targeting has shown that the fight against inflation requires collaboration from all relevant parties. Therefore, bringing inflation permanently down to the 5-percent target requires all institutions to continue resolutely with the efforts made in recent years.
21. Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
22. Sustained fiscal discipline has become a fundamental element in reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years. In the current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the value added from maintaining and further advancing these achievements is significant. Any measure that would ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels."

2016,20 May 2016,Press Release on the Maximum Interest Rates for Credit Cards in Q3 2016,"No: 2016-19
20 May 2016
Press Release on the Maximum Interest Rates for Credit Cards in Q3 2016 
The monthly maximum interest rates that banks can charge on credit card borrowing in the third quarter of 2016 have been left unchanged.
The CBRT sets maximum interest rates for credit card borrowing under legal authority expressed most recently in the CBRT Communiqué No. 2014/5 on Maximum Interest Rates to be Applied to Credit Card Transactions published in the Official Gazette No: 29153 dated 22 October 2014. Accordingly, to be effective from 1 July 2016, for the credit card borrowings, the monthly maximum contractual interest rate will be 2.02 percent for the Turkish lira and 1.62 percent for foreign exchange transactions, whereas the monthly maximum overdue interest rate will be 2.52 percent for the Turkish lira and 2.12 percent for foreign exchange transactions.
Banks are not allowed to charge higher interest rates than the rates announced by the CBRT for credit cards. Banks are free to determine their respective rates at their own discretion provided that they are below these ceilings. The maximum contractual and overdue interest rates for credit card transactions for the three-month period starting on 1 October 2016 will be announced by the CBRT prior to that date.
Banks in Turkey, as is the case in other countries, charge higher interest rates for credit card borrowing than they do for consumer loans. The CBRT therefore advises credit card holders with short-term credit needs to seek a consumer loan rather than borrowing on personal credit cards.

The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been reduced from 10 percent to 9.50 percent, and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.25 percent,
b) One-week repo rate has been kept at 7.5 percent,

Annual loan growth continues at reasonable rates in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. While domestic demand continues to have a positive impact on growth, demand from the European Union economies continues to support exports. Accordingly economic activity displays a moderate and stable course of growth. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly.
Recently, the global volatility has increased to some extent.

2016,31 May 2016,SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING,"No: 2016-21
31 May 2016
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 24 May 2016
     
Inflation Developments
1.    In April, consumer prices rose by 0.78 percent, and annual inflation dropped by 0.89 points to 6.57 percent. Consumer inflation declined further on the back of unprocessed food prices. In this period, annual inflation in core indicators remained high, while their underlying trend continued to improve.
2.    Annual inflation in the food and non-alcoholic beverages group fell by 3.20 points to 1.38 percent. The deceleration in food inflation was mainly driven by unprocessed food prices, the annual inflation of which plunged to -5.94 percent. In this group, prices of fresh fruits and vegetables remained below the previous year’s levels due to increased supply of products, whereas red meat prices exhibit a mild outlook amid the measures in effect. On the other hand, processed food inflation sustained its high course also due to prices in the bread-cereals group. On the energy front, prices rose by 0.34 percent in line with international oil prices, while annual inflation sustained the mild outlook with 1.74 percent.
3.    Prices of services increased by 0.64 percent, and the annual services inflation edged down by 0.10 point to 8.76 percent in April. Being the culprit of high figures in services inflation, the restaurants-hotels and other services groups lost pace in the last couple of months. The mild course in food prices reflected favorably on prices in the restaurants-hotels group, and the attenuated cumulative depreciation in the Turkish lira underpins the slowdown in inflation in other services. On the other hand, inflation in transport services continued with an uptrend and rent inflation rose to 8.39 percent. All in all, despite some deceleration, the underlying trend of services prices remained high.
4.    Annual core goods inflation remained flat with 10.11 percent in April. Annual inflation recorded an increase in the clothing group, but edged down in others. Prices of durable goods registered a modest monthly increase by 0.43 percent, yet the uptrend in subgroups like furniture and white goods proved notable. The underlying trend of core goods weakened further, and when clothing is excluded, the improvement is more remarkable. Amid the decelerating cumulative exchange rate effects, annual core goods inflation is projected to slow in the second half of the year.
5.    In sum, inflation has recently recorded a notable decline driven mainly by the unprocessed food prices. Despite the fall in inflation, the Committee stated that the improvement in the underlying core inflation trend remains limited.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6.    Data for the first quarter of 2016 suggest that economic activity remains on the rise. Up by 1.5 percent from the previous quarter’s average, industrial production recorded the largest increase since the first quarter of 2014. Production of basic pharmaceuticals made the greatest contribution to quarterly growth, while main industries such as food, clothing and textiles also contributed to growth, which is a favorable development. In addition, the steady increase in the exports to the EU is another factor supporting industrial production growth.
7.    Data on spending side point to a rising domestic demand for the first quarter. Among indicators of private consumption, the production and imports of consumer goods grew robustly. Likewise, sales of automobiles, home appliances and homes were up in the first quarter. On the investment side, the production of capital goods dropped whereas their imports increased. The production of capital goods declined due to vehicle manufacturing, yet vehicles excluded, it posted a rise. Moreover, both the warmer-than-normal weather in winter months and the upsurge in the production and imports of nonmetallic minerals suggest some increase in construction activities for the first quarter. Against this background, it is assessed that private consumer spending was more robust than investments, and private consumption was the main driver of domestic demand in the first quarter.
8.    Favorable developments in the terms of trade accompanied by the moderate course of consumer loans support the recovery in the current account balance. The growing EU demand continues to support exports. High market-shifting flexibility of exports limits downside risks caused by geopolitical developments. Thus, amid continued EU demand growth, low commodity prices and ongoing macroprudential policies, the current account balance is expected to improve further. Yet, the falling number of foreign visitors weighs on revenues from services, posing a downside risk to the current account deficit.
9.    Seasonally-adjusted unemployment rates were down month-on-month in February 2016, due to the weakening labor supply and the moderate gain in nonfarm employment. Across sub-sectors, services provided the largest contribution to nonfarm employment growth, while construction employment continued to expand. Meanwhile, industrial employment continued to drop slightly in February. In view of production and survey indicators, employment is expected to remain on a modest track in the short term. This labor market outlook is likely to spur growth in 2016.
10.    In sum, current indicators suggest that the economy continues to grow at a moderate and steady pace. In the upcoming period, the income channel is likely to push domestic demand higher through wage increases and a food price-driven decline in headline inflation. Although geopolitical developments continue to pose downside risks, the growing EU demand continues to support exports, and thus production.
Monetary Policy and Risks
11.    Annual loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. Risk weight and minimum wage arrangements are expected to boost loan growth further in the upcoming period via loan supply and household income channels. Thus, annual loan growth rates are likely to remain at reasonable levels. With respect to the composition of loans, commercial loans continue to grow faster than consumer loans. This composition not only limits medium-term inflationary pressures but also supports the improvement in the current account balance.
12.    Economic activity remains on a moderate and steady growth track. In the first quarter, industrial production recorded a robust quarter-on-quarter increase while external demand supported growth. In the forthcoming period, domestic demand is expected to provide further support to growth while the rising EU demand will continue to promote exports. Employment remained on a moderate upward path in the first quarter. Given wage developments, employment growth is likely to support domestic demand further through the income channel. On the external demand side, geopolitical tensions and the weakening global growth continued to pose risks, and risks to services exports became prevalent. However, the European economic recovery and the market-shifting flexibility of exports alleviate the downside risks to external balance. Moreover, the favorable impact of the cumulative fall in commodity prices on the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance.
13.    Recently, the global volatility has increased to some extent amid ongoing concerns over global growth and continued uncertainty about global monetary policies. Accordingly, emerging-market portfolio flows slowed slightly while risk premiums and exchange rate volatilities recorded increases. The Committee assesses that the tight monetary policy stance, the cautious macroprudential policies and the effective use of the policy instruments laid out in the road map published in August 2015 enhance the resilience of the economy against shocks. These policy measures have tamed the heightened volatility in both exchange rates and loans. In fact, the Turkish lira has followed a relatively less volatile path than other emerging market currencies since September 2015. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to take a measured step towards simplification by lowering the marginal funding rate. Moreover, within the context of the road map, related departments made presentations about the arrangements that would increase the predictability of liquidity policy and make liquidity management of banks more efficient.
14.    On the other hand, the improvement in the underlying core inflation trend remains limited, necessitating the maintenance of the tight liquidity policy stance. Although low imported-input costs have eased the upside risks to the inflation outlook, the improvement in core inflation is still limited. The weakening yet ongoing lagged effects of cumulative exchange rate movements, high levels of inflation expectations and wage developments restrain the improvement in the underlying trend of inflation. Food inflation has recently seen a marked decline on the back of unprocessed food prices. The falling food inflation led to a decrease in consumer inflation as well. Yet, given the elevated core inflation, it is important to remain cautious about the inflation outlook. To this end, the Committee stated that the current tight liquidity stance should be maintained in order to ensure that the recently observed disinflation becomes permanent.
15.    In the upcoming period, the monetary policy stance will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained. Moreover, global and domestic volatilities will be monitored closely and necessary measures will be taken for the foreign exchange and Turkish lira markets. In sum, the policy stance will remain tight against the inflation outlook, stabilizing for the FX liquidity and supportive of financial stability.
16.    Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
17.    Sustained fiscal discipline has become a fundamental element in reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years. In the current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the value added from maintaining and further advancing these achievements is significant. Any measure that would ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels."

DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Participating Committee Members
Murat Çetinkaya (Governor), Ahmet Faruk Aysan, Erkan Kilimci, Murat Uysal, Abdullah Yavaş.
 
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been reduced from 9.5 percent to 9 percent, and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.25 percent,
b) One-week repo rate has been kept at 7.5 percent,
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been reduced from 11 percent to 10.5 percent.
Annual loan growth continues at reasonable rates in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. While domestic demand continues to have a positive impact on growth, demand from the European Union economies continues to support exports. Accordingly economic activity displays a moderate and stable course of growth. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly.
Recently, the global volatility has increased to some extent. The Committee assesses that the tight monetary policy stance, the cautious macroprudential policies and the effective use of the policy instruments laid out in the road map published in August 2015 increase the resilience of the economy against shocks. In this respect, the Committee decided to take a measured step towards simplification.
Inflation has displayed a marked decline in recent months, mainly due to favorable course of unprocessed food prices and the improvement in the core inflation trend. However, the developments in services inflation and unit labor costs necessitate the maintenance of a tight liquidity stance.
Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

2016,28 June 2016,SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING,"No: 2016-25
28 June 2016
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 21 June 2016
Inflation Developments
1.    In May, consumer prices rose by 0.58 percent, and annual inflation remained flat with 6.58 percent. Food inflation increased somewhat due to the base effect, yet maintained its low course and continued to limit consumer inflation. In this period, annual inflation in core indicators registered a decline, while improvement in the underlying trend proved more evident.
2.    Annual inflation in the food and non-alcoholic beverages group rose by 1.09 points to 2.47 percent in May. The low course of food inflation was mainly driven by unprocessed food prices, the annual inflation of which was -4.22 percent. In this group, prices of fresh fruits and vegetables remained below the previous year’s levels due to increased supply of products, whereas red meat prices exhibited a mild outlook amid the measures in effect. On the other hand, processed food inflation sustained its high course due to prices of items other than meat and dairy products. Although leading indicators on June indicate that unprocessed food prices may be subject to a partial correction and the group’s annual inflation may soar, food prices are expected to support the low course in inflation across the year. On the energy front, prices rose by 1.10 percent in line with the international oil prices and depreciating Turkish lira, while annual inflation sustained the favorable outlook with 1.65 percent.
3.    Prices of services increased by 0.76 percent, and the annual services inflation stood close to the previous month’s level with 8.74 percent in May. Being the culprit of high figures in services inflation, the deceleration in restaurants-hotels and other services groups in the last couple of months continued in May excluding package tour prices. The mild course in food prices reflected favorably on prices in the restaurants-hotels group, and the attenuated cumulative effects of the exchange rate underpins the slowdown in inflation in other services. On the other hand, it is assessed that the surge in unit labor costs in the first quarter is also responsible for the high course in services inflation. Moreover, it is notable that rents soared in May as they did in April. All in all, the underlying trend of services prices remained high in May.
4.    Annual core goods inflation decreased by 1.29 points to 8.82 percent in May. Annual inflation recorded a decline in all sub-groups, and the clothing and durable goods groups stood out. Prices of durable goods registered a favorable outlook on account of the fall in white goods and flat course of automobile prices in addition to declining furniture prices following an uptrend in the first four months of the year. The underlying trend of core goods improved further, and when clothing is excluded, the improvement is still remarkable. Amid the decelerating cumulative exchange rate effects, annual core goods inflation is projected to slow in the second half of the year.
5.    In sum, inflation has recently recorded a notable decline driven mainly by the unprocessed food prices. Core inflation indicators also recorded favorable figures, yet remained high in May. Meanwhile, the improvement in the underlying core inflation trend proved more remarkable in this period. Accordingly, annual inflation in core indicators is projected to fall further in the upcoming period. However, the high inflation trend in the services group coupled with the unit labor cost developments limit disinflation.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6.    According to TurkStat data for the first quarter of 2016, GDP grew by 4.8 percent year-on-year. On the production side, industries and services made the greatest contribution to the first quarter’s annual growth. Adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects, GDP increased by 0.8 percent from the previous quarter. On the spending side, consumption and exports were the main drivers of quarterly growth. In this period, private consumption accelerated amid wage hikes, employment growth and improving financial conditions. Exports were buoyed by the strengthening EU recovery. Nonetheless, with imports gaining remarkably in the first quarter due to increased consumption, net exports contributed negatively to quarterly growth. In short, growth was driven largely by consumption and supported somewhat by exports in the first quarter, yet capital accumulation remained moderate. 
7.    Data for the second quarter of 2016 indicate no additional acceleration for economic activity. Industrial production dropped by 1.1 percent month-on-month in April on the back of mining, vehicle, furniture and computer industries. May’s PMI indicators and BTS indicators for orders over the last three months performed slightly better than in April, suggesting some correction in industrial production for May. Given favorable calendar effects and May’s strike-driven low base effect from automotive manufacturing in last year, industrial production is expected to post a stronger year-on-year increase in May than in April. 
8.    Data on the spending front point to a slowing consumer demand and mildly recovering investments for the second quarter. The production and imports of consumer goods declined in April. Sales of home appliances fell marginally during April-May, whereas sales of automobiles remained on the rise. Among indicators for investments, imports of non-vehicle capital goods and machinery-equipment were up from the previous quarter’s average, while their production dropped. Sales of light and heavy commercial vehicles increased in the April-May period. The waning uncertainty and improved financial conditions are believed to help investments recover. 
9.    Favorable developments in the terms of trade accompanied by the moderate course of consumer loans support the recovery in the current account balance. The growing EU demand continues to support exports. High market-shifting flexibility of exports limits downside risks caused by geopolitical developments. Yet, the falling number of foreign visitors weighs on revenues from services, posing a downside risk to the current account balance.
10.    Seasonally-adjusted unemployment rates were down in March for the second consecutive month. The strengthening non-farm employment growth pulled unemployment rates down despite the increased labor force participation. Industrial employment saw a moderate gain, while construction and services employment expanded significantly. Failing to spread across all sectors, the employment growth in services was driven mostly by public administration and community services. In view of production and survey indicators, employment is expected to remain on a modest track in the short term. Yet, the SSI data indicate that the stagnant tourism industry has started to affect employment. Thus, the unemployment rate continues to face upside risks for the period ahead.
11.    In sum, current indicators suggest that the economy continues to grow at a moderate and steady pace. Income channel supports domestic demand through wage increases. Although geopolitical developments continue to pose downside risks, the growing EU demand continues to support exports, and thus production.
Monetary Policy and Risks
12.    Annual loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. Risk weight arrangements and wage developments are expected to boost loan growth further in the upcoming period via loan supply and household income channels. Thus, annual loan growth rates are likely to remain at reasonable levels. With respect to the composition of loans, commercial loans continue to grow faster than consumer loans. This composition not only limits medium-term inflationary pressures but also supports the improvement in the current account balance.
13.    Economic activity remains on a moderate and steady growth track. In the first quarter, GDP expanded on the back of domestic demand. Consumer spending spurred domestic demand while investments remained weak. Despite the negative implications of geopolitical developments in external demand, exports to the EU remained on the rise. Accordingly, exports made a positive contribution to growth in the first quarter. Domestic demand is expected to continue to support growth in the upcoming period. Employment remains on a moderate upward path. Given wage developments, employment growth is likely to support domestic demand further through the income channel. On the external demand side, geopolitical tensions and the weakening global growth continued to pose risks, while risks to the tourism industry became prevalent. However, the robust increase in Turkey’s exports to the EU and the market-shifting flexibility of exports alleviate the downside risks to external balance. Moreover, the favorable impact of the cumulative fall in commodity prices on the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance.
14.    Global financial markets remain volatile amid ongoing concerns over global growth, developments regarding UK's exit from the EU and continued uncertainty about global monetary policies. Accordingly, emerging-market portfolio flows slowed while risk premiums and exchange rate volatilities recorded increases. The Committee assesses that the tight monetary policy stance, the cautious macroprudential policies and the effective use of the policy instruments laid out in the road map published in August 2015 enhance the resilience of the economy against shocks. In fact, the Turkish lira has followed a relatively less volatile path than other emerging market currencies since September 2015. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to take a measured step towards simplification by lowering the marginal funding rate. Moreover, within the context of the road map, related departments made presentations about the arrangements that would increase the predictability of liquidity policy and make liquidity management of banks more efficient.
15.    The sharp decline in food inflation since the beginning of the year helped to bring consumer inflation markedly down. The recent improvement in the core inflation indicators also contributed to this disinflation. Low imported-input costs and the continued weakening of the lagged effects of cumulative exchange rate movements support the improvement in the underlying core inflation trend. On the other hand, the underlying services inflation trend remains elevated. High levels of inflation expectations and unit labor cost developments restrain the improvement in the underlying trend of inflation. To this end, the Committee stated that the current tight liquidity stance should be maintained in order to ensure that the recently observed disinflation becomes permanent. 
16.    In the upcoming period, the monetary policy stance will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained. Moreover, global and domestic volatilities will be monitored closely and necessary measures will be taken for the foreign exchange and Turkish lira markets. In sum, the policy stance will remain tight against the inflation outlook, stabilizing for the FX liquidity and supportive of financial stability.
17.    Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
18.    Sustained fiscal discipline has become a fundamental element in reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years. In the current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the value added from maintaining and further advancing these achievements is significant. Any measure that would ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels."

The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been reduced from 9 percent to 8,75 percent, and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.25 percent,
b) One-week repo rate has been kept at 7.5 percent,
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been reduced from 10.5 percent to 10.25 percent.
Annual loan growth continues at reasonable rates in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. While domestic demand continues to have a positive impact on growth, demand from the European Union economies continues to support exports. Accordingly economic activity displays a moderate and stable course of growth. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly.
Recently, domestic developments have led to fluctuations in financial markets. The Committee assesses that the recent liquidity measures have alleviated the volatility in financial markets. Moreover, the tight monetary policy stance, the cautious macroprudential policies and the effective use of the policy instruments laid out in the road map published in August 2015 have increased the resilience of the economy against shocks. Also considering its contribution to the effectiveness of monetary policy, the Committee decided to take a measured and cautious step towards simplification.
The Committee has indicated that inflation may display a marked increase in the short term due to developments in unprocessed food and tobacco prices. Meanwhile, the core inflation trend is expected to improve gradually. Yet, the developments in inflation outlook necessitate the maintenance of a tight liquidity stance.
Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained. Moreover, market developments will be closely monitored and the necessary liquidity measures will continue to be taken to support financial stability.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

2016,26 July 2016,SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING,"No: 2016-32
26 July 2016
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 19 July 2016
Inflation Developments
1. In June, consumer prices increased by 0.47 percent, and annual inflation went up by 1.06 points to 7.64 percent. In this period, food inflation posted a notable rise due to the correction in unprocessed food prices and the base effect. Annual inflation in core indicators registered a decline, while the underlying trends remained virtually unchanged.
2. As projected in the Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting in the previous month, annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages climbed to 6.63 percent in June due to unprocessed food prices. The prices of fresh fruits and vegetables in unprocessed food category increased notably. Hence, annual inflation in unprocessed food prices increased by around 9 points to 4.62 percent given the low base effect. On the other hand, processed food inflation posted the lowest monthly rate of increase over the last 3 years and annual inflation in this category declined to 8.38 percent. Preliminary indicators in July point out that annual food inflation may continue to rise due to unprocessed food prices. On the energy front, prices increased by 0.50 percent in line with the international oil prices, and annual inflation hit 2.33 percent.
3. Prices of services increased by 0.42 percent, and the annual services inflation decreased by 0.5 points to 8.25 percent in June. Prices of restaurants and hotels, which have been decelerating in the last couple of months, continued to slow down in June amid prices of accommodation services. Waning cumulative effects of the Turkish lira depreciation and the favorable course of other services supported the slowdown in the services inflation. Accordingly, the underlying trend of services inflation recorded an improvement in June. On the other hand, rents continued with the high-rated increases of the previous two months and recorded an annual inflation of 8.83 percent.
4. Annual core goods inflation increased by 0.31 points to 9.13 percent in June. Annual inflation posted a rise in durable goods, but remained flat in other subcategories. Prices of durable goods displayed an unfavorable outlook mainly due to the depreciation of the Turkish lira in May. Prices in the automotive sector, which enjoys relatively robust sales in the domestic market, displayed an upsurge in June. Meanwhile, the labor-intensive furniture sector continued to see price increases, albeit at a decelerating pace. Accordingly, the underlying core goods inflation increased slightly. Amid the decelerating cumulative exchange rate effects, annual core goods inflation is expected to slow down in the remainder of the year.
5. In sum, consumer inflation increased in June mainly owing to the unprocessed food prices. Core inflation indicators continued to decline, albeit at a limited pace. The price hikes to tobacco products in July will pose upward pressure on consumer inflation. The Committee highlighted that inflation may register an upsurge in the short term on account of the developments in unprocessed food and tobacco prices. Meanwhile, core inflation is expected to sustain its gradual downtrend.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6. Data for the second quarter of 2016 indicate an ongoing yet slowing uptrend in economic activity. Adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects, the industrial production index increased by 1.6 percent month-on-month in May; however, the sluggish course in April caused production to see a quarterly fall of 0.4 percent during April-May period. Current indicators for June suggest that industrial production may follow a more moderate path compared to May. Survey indicators on output and orders were down in June, while automobile manufacturing recorded a small drop.
7. Data on the spending side point to a modest course in final domestic demand. The production of consumer goods remained horizontal during April-May period, whereas the imports thereof declined. A similar pattern was observed in the production and imports of investment goods. Meanwhile, sales of automobiles and commercial vehicles remained on the rise in the second quarter. Firms’ investment demand was relatively weak in the second quarter. In the April-May period, the non-gold export quantity index was up only slightly from the first quarter, while the non-gold import quantity index posted a fall.
8. Favorable developments in the terms of trade accompanied by the moderate course of consumer loans support the recovery in the current account balance. Despite heightened geopolitical risks, exports to the European Union countries continue to grow at an accelerated pace in the recent period. In this regard, Turkey’s high market-shifting flexibility supports exports. Yet, the possible spillovers of falling tourism revenues on the current account deficit may be felt more markedly by the summer months. Meanwhile, commodity prices are also expected to become gradually less supportive of the current account deficit in coming months.
9. Seasonally adjusted unemployment rates remained unchanged month-on-month in April. In this period, non-farm employment continued to grow, while the rising participation rate restricted the decline in unemployment rates. The upsurge in construction employment was interrupted, while industrial employment recovered back to 2015 levels after falling in the first few months. Services employment continues to expand, albeit at a slower pace than in March. The employment growth in services continues to be driven by public administration and community services. In the light of leading indicators, employment is expected to remain on a modest track in the short term. Yet, the data by the Social Security Institution indicate that the stagnant tourism sector has started to have spillovers on employment.
10. To sum up, current indicators suggest that the economy continues to grow at a moderate and steady pace. The income channel supports domestic demand through wage increases. Although geopolitical developments pose persisting downside risks, the growing demand from European Union countries continues to have favorable effects on exports, and thus production. However, the ongoing slump in the tourism sector poses a downside risk to economic activity and the current account balance.
Monetary Policy and Risks
11. The Committee evaluated the medium-term projections to be published in the July Inflation Report. In the second quarter of the year, inflation increased in line with the projections of the April Inflation Report mainly due to unprocessed food and energy prices, but went down across core items. Even though inflation is projected to rise in the short term, core inflation is expected to settle on a milder track across the year. The recent hikes in unprocessed food prices and the tobacco price adjustments will cause an upsurge in July inflation. Yet, food prices may see a downward correction in the upcoming periods. Owing to the measures taken by the Food and Agricultural Product Markets Monitoring Committee (Food Committee) accompanied by the seasonal decline in food demand caused by the tourism sector, the year-end food price inflation is expected to prove lower compared to the previous reporting period. In addition, owing to the expected deceleration in economic activity in the short term, core inflation is anticipated to exhibit a milder course compared to the previous reporting period across the year. Meanwhile, the minimum wage hike is estimated to have a limited effect on core inflation on the back of state support. Given the forecast assumptions and external conditions, inflation forecasts for the upcoming period were left unchanged from the previous Inflation Report.
12. Financial conditions continue to be tight despite the recent rise in the global risk appetite, which slightly eased conditions. Financial conditions are likely to remain tight in the short term owing to domestic developments and weaker capital flows. Accordingly, loan growth rates are not expected to recover notably. The moderate course of loans is driven not only by demand but also by the supply-side factors. Recent surveys show that loan standards did not display any easing. Domestic developments have recently led to fluctuations in markets. Liquidity measures taken by the Committee have partially limited the volatility in markets. It is projected that the effects of the fluctuations in markets will prove temporary and Turkey will sustain its resilience through its sound economic fundamentals. On the other hand, to balance the short-term effects of the tightness in financial conditions, the Committee may make downside adjustments to required reserves, if deemed necessary.
13. Economic activity maintains a moderate and stable course of growth. Consumption spending fuels the domestic demand, while investments remain relatively sluggish. Despite the adverse effects of geopolitical developments on external demand, exports of goods to the European Union countries remain strong. Restored relations with Russia may support external demand as of the last quarter. Accordingly, exports are expected to provide further support to growth in the upcoming period. Meanwhile, the steady increase in employment and wage developments boost domestic demand through the income channel. In this respect, economic activity is expected to grow moderately across the year.
14. Recent terrorist attacks and domestic developments pose a downside risk to economic activity especially through the tourism sector. Thus, the economy may witness a slowdown in the second and third quarters in which tourism revenues register high share within economic activity. In fact, leading indicators of the second quarter point to a quarter-on-quarter deceleration, which may also continue through the third quarter. On the other hand, the economy is expected to maintain a steady course of growth amid structural arrangements and investment incentives. Against this background, risks to economic activity are likely to be balanced in the medium term.
15. The current account deficit may widen slightly in the short term even though external balances continue to recover. The current account balance is being positively affected by the lagged effects of the decline in energy prices. Moreover, the moderate course of loans and the increasing share of commercial loans in loan composition also support the improvement in the current account balance. However, the fact that the current economic growth is fueled by the domestic demand and that the tourism sector is experiencing a slowdown signals for a possible deceleration in the recovery of the current account balance in the upcoming period. Yet, the current account deficit is estimated to hover at reasonable and predictable levels across the year.
16. Inflation forecasts accommodate both upside and downside risks. Recent exchange rate developments pose an upside risk to inflation through the cost channel. Moreover, the possible adjustments to administered prices and taxes to compensate for the effect of the recent rise in budget expenditures on fiscal balances may push inflation upwards towards the end of the year. On the other hand, latest domestic developments constitute downside risks to demand and inflation through the confidence channel and the tourism sector. The Committee will closely monitor the developments affecting inflation and take necessary policy measures to achieve price stability.
17. Despite experiencing significant external shocks in recent years, the adopted policy framework was successful in containing the deterioration in inflation and inflation expectations. However, at this point, price stability is yet to be achieved. Ten years of experience with the inflation targeting regime showed that combatting inflation requires joint efforts. Thus, in order to reduce inflation to the 5-percent target permanently, all institutions must fulfill their duties by taking structural factors into account. In this respect, actions taken by the Food Committee set an invaluable precedent. In the upcoming period, the CBRT will contribute to these efforts by undertaking extensive studies to examine structural issues in inflation dynamics.
18. Global financial markets and capital flows remain highly volatile. Despite the recent slight rise in the risk appetite, persisting concerns over global growth and uncertainties in global monetary policies feed into volatility. The tight monetary policy stance, the cautious macroprudential policy and the effective use of the policy tools announced in the road map of August 2015 enhanced the resilience of the economy against external shocks to a certain extent. However, adverse domestic developments may cause fluctuations in markets if accompanied by global volatilities and this may place extra pressure on financial conditions. The Committee will closely monitor the developments in both global and domestic markets and take necessary stabilizing measures by utilizing its large variety of tools.
19. The recent monetary policy decisions of the Committee should be evaluated under the scope of the simplification process. The ultimate aim of the simplification is to achieve a narrow and symmetrical corridor and provide funding via a single rate. The simplification is believed to contribute to the effectiveness of the transmission mechanism. Therefore, simplification of the monetary policy is planned to be finalized within a reasonable schedule. The pace and timing of simplification will depend on the developments regarding inflation and financial stability.
20. Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
21. Sustained fiscal discipline has become essential in reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years. In the current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the gains from maintaining and further advancing these achievements are significant. Any measure to provide permanent fiscal discipline and reduction in the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels."

20 August 2016
PRESS RELEASE ON THE MAXIMUM INTEREST RATES FOR CREDIT CARDS IN Q4 2016
The monthly maximum interest rates that banks can charge on credit card borrowing in the fourth quarter of 2016 have been left unchanged.
The CBRT sets maximum interest rates for credit card borrowing under legal authority expressed most recently in the CBRT Communiqué No. 2014/5 on Maximum Interest Rates to be Applied to Credit Card Transactions published in the Official Gazette No: 29153 dated 22 October 2014. Accordingly, to be effective from 1 October 2016, for the credit card borrowings, the monthly maximum contractual interest rate will be 2.02 percent for the Turkish lira and 1.62 percent for foreign exchange transactions, whereas the monthly maximum overdue interest rate will be 2.52 percent for the Turkish lira and 2.12 percent for foreign exchange transactions.
Banks are not allowed to charge higher interest rates than the rates announced by the CBRT for credit cards. Banks are free to determine their respective rates at their own discretion provided that they are below these ceilings. The maximum contractual and overdue interest rates for credit card transactions for the three-month period starting on 1 January 2017 will be announced by the CBRT prior to that date.
Banks in Turkey, as is the case in other countries, charge higher interest rates for credit card borrowing than they do for consumer loans. The CBRT therefore advises credit card holders with short-term credit needs to seek a consumer loan rather than borrowing on personal credit cards.

23 August 2016
DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Participating Committee Members
Murat Çetinkaya (Governor), Ahmet Faruk Aysan, Erkan Kilimci, Murat Uysal, Abdullah Yavaş.
 
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been reduced from 8.75 percent to 8.5 percent, and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.25 percent,
b) One-week repo rate has been kept at 7.5 percent,
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been reduced from 10.25 percent to 10 percent.
Annual loan growth continues at reasonable rates in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. Although developments in tourism revenues will have a negative impact in the short run, the lagged effects of the developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans will continue to contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. While domestic demand is having a positive impact on growth, albeit at a lesser extent, demand from the European Union economies continues to support exports. Accordingly, economic activity displays a moderate and stable course of growth. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly.
The adverse impact of domestic developments in mid-July on market indicators has been largely reversed due to improved global risk appetite and the recent measures. Moreover, the tight monetary policy stance, the cautious macroprudential policies and the effective use of the policy instruments laid out in the road map published in August 2015 have increased the resilience of the economy against shocks. Also considering its contribution to the effectiveness of monetary policy, the Committee decided to take a measured and cautious step towards simplification.
Unprocessed food prices, which have recently shown marked increases, are projected to display a downward correction in the short term. Meanwhile, the core inflation trend is expected to improve gradually. Yet, the developments in the inflation outlook necessitate the maintenance of a tight liquidity stance.
Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
2016,31 August 2016,SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING,"No: 2016-37
31 August 2016
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 23 August 2016
Inflation Developments
1- In July, consumer prices increased by 1.16 percent, and annual inflation went up by 1.15 points to 8.79 percent. As stated in the Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting of July, this rise was driven by prices of unprocessed food and tobacco products. Both annual inflation figures and the underlying trends of core indicators followed a flat course in this period.
2- Having surged in the last two months, annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages climbed to 9.69 percent due to the prices of fresh fruits and vegetables. However, annual inflation in food items excluding fresh fruits and vegetables registered a decline. Agricultural prices also displayed a similar path, indicating that the rise in food inflation in this period stemmed from producer prices. On the other hand, leading indicators regarding August point out a downward correction in unprocessed food prices. On the energy front, prices fell by 0.40 percent on account of the decline in international oil prices. Thus, annual energy inflation maintained a low course with 2.40 percent.
3- Prices of services increased by 1.07 percent, and the annual services inflation rose by 0.30 points to 8.55 percent in July. Annual inflation increased in transport and communication services, but remained almost unchanged in other sub-groups in this period. Restaurants and hotels group also exhibited a high monthly rise in line with the high course of food inflation. Meanwhile, the monthly rate of increase in rents, which had been high for a while, slowed somewhat in July. As a result, the underlying trend of services recorded an increase in July. The surge in unit labor costs in the first quarter coupled with increased rigidities due to the prolonged high course of consumer inflation weigh on services inflation. On the other hand, the recent deceleration in economic activity may curb services inflation.
4- Annual core goods inflation edged down by 0.31 points to 8.82 percent in July, driven by durable goods. Prices of durable goods excluding furniture displayed a favorable outlook. Upon the lingering labor-driven cost pressures since the start of the year, cumulative price increases in the furniture group amounted to 8 percent in the first 7 months. The underlying core goods inflation posted a decline in July. However, the recent depreciation in the Turkish lira is expected to deteriorate the core goods inflation to some extent in the short term. Nevertheless, waning cumulative exchange rate effects are likely to pull annual core goods inflation further down in the upcoming period.
5- In sum, consumer inflation surged in the last two months owing to the unprocessed food prices. In addition, tobacco products saw price hikes in July as well. The impact of this rise will be seen also in August, albeit to a relatively limited extent. The Committee envisages that unprocessed food prices, which saw notable increases in the last couple of months, may display a downward correction in the short term. Meanwhile, core inflation is expected to sustain its gradual downtrend.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6- Data for the second quarter of 2016 indicate a slowing yet ongoing uptrend in economic activity. Adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects, the industrial production index decreased by 1.4 percent in June compared to May. Thus, following a robust quarterly increase of 1.4 percent in the first quarter, production declined by 0.6 percent in the second quarter. Despite the favorable figures in exports excluding gold, negative contribution of net exports to growth continued amid the rise in import demand coupled with the growing loss in tourism revenues.
7- Data on the expenditure side point to a modest course in final domestic demand in the second quarter. The production of consumer goods posted a decline on a quarterly basis, while that of investment goods remained flat. Retail trade sales index also exhibited an almost flat pattern, signaling a slowdown compared to the first quarter. Data regarding the third quarter indicate that the private sector demand may weaken compared to the first half of the year. In fact, July witnessed decreases in sales of automobiles, white goods and light commercial vehicles. Meanwhile, the new job posts and the PMI employment data also confirmed the signs of deceleration.
8- Although developments in tourism revenues will have a negative impact in the short run, the lagged effects of the developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans will continue to contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. The rising demand from the European Union countries continues to have a favorable effect on our exports. In spite of the persisting geopolitical risks, Turkey’s high market-shifting flexibility continues to support exports. Meanwhile, the favorable impact of commodity prices on the current account deficit is expected to diminish gradually in coming months.
9- Seasonally-adjusted unemployment rates posted an increase in May 2016 compared to the previous period. In this period, non-farm employment growth posted a slowdown, pushing unemployment rates upwards. The prolonged uptrend in construction employment was interrupted to a limited extent, while industrial employment remained flat after a recovery in the March-April period, and the services employment picked up slightly compared to the past. The data from the Social Security Institution indicate that the stagnant tourism sector started to have spillovers on employment. Leading indicators signal a deceleration in employment growth in the short term.
10- To sum up, economic activity continues to grow at a moderate and stable pace. Domestic developments of July may cause a pause in this trend in the short term. However, this is not likely to be a permanent trend, as the recent measures contained the adverse impacts on the markets. On the other hand, the reduction in tourism revenues is expected to curtail the improvement in the current account balance, rise in employment and growth.
Monetary Policy and Risks
11- Financial conditions remain tight, while the moderate course of annual loan growth rates continue. Despite the recent rise in global risk appetite and capital inflows, the improvement in financial conditions is detained due to domestic developments. The gradual fall in the marginal funding rate spilled over into loan and deposit rates remarkably, yet loan-deposit spreads remain high, and loan standards exercised by banks have not eased. Moreover, the moderate course of final domestic demand also restricts loan growth. Given the demand and supply-side factors no noticeable rebound is envisaged in loan growth rates in the short term.
12- Economic activity maintains a moderate and stable course of growth. Consumption spending has slowed down slightly, while investment remains relatively sluggish. Meanwhile, the steady increase in employment and wage developments support domestic demand through the income channel. Despite the adverse effects of geopolitical developments on external demand, exports of goods to the European Union countries remain strong. Restored relations with Russia may also support external demand gradually. Accordingly, exports of goods are expected to provide further contributions to growth in the upcoming period. In this respect, economic activity is expected to show a moderate pace of growth across the year. Domestic developments in July, geopolitical factors, waning global growth and sluggish tourism sector pose a downside risk to economic activity. On the other hand, domestic confidence indices have not shown a sharp deterioration. This, together with the market-shifting flexibility of our exports put a limit on the downside risks.
13- The volatility in global financial markets has recently eased, and portfolio inflows to emerging markets gained momentum amid the increased risk appetite. The consequences of the mid-July turmoil in Turkey on financial markets were largely taken back thanks to the rise in the global risk appetite and the liquidity measures. The tight monetary policy stance, the cautious macroprudential policy and the effective use of the policy tools announced in the road map of August 2015 enhance the resilience of the economy against external shocks. Accordingly, the Committee decided to take one more measured step towards simplification by lowering the marginal funding rate.
14- The ultimate aim of simplification is to achieve a narrow and symmetrical corridor and provide funding via a single rate. Simplification is believed to contribute to the effectiveness of the transmission mechanism. Therefore, simplification of the monetary policy is planned to be finalized within a reasonable schedule. The pace and timing of simplification will depend on the developments regarding inflation and financial stability.
15- Pioneered by unprocessed food and tobacco products, inflation registered a notable increase in July, while core inflation indicators followed a flat course. Lagged effects of cumulative exchange rate movements eased further, underpinning the improvement in core goods inflation. However, pressures led by unit labor costs and food prices caused the underlying trend of the services inflation to remain high. In spite of the support from the low level of imported input costs, the improvement in the inflation trend has been limited. Growing signals for deceleration in domestic demand stemming from the latest domestic developments and the poor outlook in the tourism sector constitute downside risks to demand and inflation. Nevertheless, exchange rate movements and possible public price/tax adjustments keep the upside risks to inflation brisk. In this respect, developments regarding the inflation outlook necessitate the maintenance of the tight liquidity policy stance.
16- In the upcoming period, the monetary policy stance will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained.
17- Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
18- Sustained fiscal discipline has become essential in reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years. In the current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the gains from maintaining and further advancing these achievements are significant. Any measure to provide permanent fiscal discipline and reduction in the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels."

The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been reduced from 8.5 percent to 8.25 percent, and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.25 percent,

Recently released data and indicators regarding the third quarter display a deceleration in the economic activity. The Committee assesses that current financial conditions are tight. While developments in tourism revenues will have a negative impact in the short run, the lagged effects of the developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans will continue to contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. Demand from the European Union economies continues to support exports. With the supportive measures and incentives provided recently, domestic demand is expected to recover starting from the final quarter. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly.
The slowdown in aggregate demand contributes to the gradual fall in core inflation. With the help from falling food prices, headline inflation is expected to display a decline in the short term. Yet, the recent tax adjustment in fuel prices and other cost factors limit the improvement in inflation and thus necessitate the maintenance of a cautious monetary policy stance.
In light of these assessments, and considering its contribution to the effectiveness of monetary policy, the Committee decided to take a measured and cautious step towards simplification.
Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained.

2016,29 September 2016,SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING,"No: 2016-41
29 September 2016
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 22 September 2016
Inflation Developments
1.    In August, consumer prices decreased by 0.29 percent, and annual consumer inflation went down by 0.74 points to 8.05 percent. As stated in the Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting of August, this fall was driven by the correction in the unprocessed food prices. Prices of tobacco products, on the other hand, manifested the dragged effect of the July correction in August. In this period, core indicators saw a decline in annual inflation, but a slight increase in underlying trends driven by core goods.
2.    Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages tumbled down to 6.19 percent due mainly to the decline in the prices of fresh fruits and vegetables. Meanwhile, inflation in food items excluding fresh fruits and vegetables has exhibited a favorable course lately. Leading indicators regarding September hint at a prolonged downward correction in unprocessed food inflation. On the energy front, prices declined on account of the falling fuel prices. Annual energy inflation climbed to 2.97 percent due to the base effect. In September, lump-sum SCT applied to fuel products was raised, which is expected to have direct effect on consumer inflation by 0.3 points.
3.    Prices of services increased by 0.71 percent, and the annual services inflation fell by 0.46 points to 8.09 percent in August. Annual inflation decreased in all sub-groups except rents in this period. The fall in annual inflation was driven by the favorable course of food prices in addition to the inflation in the prices of restaurant-hotel services that lost pace due to the base effect. The surge in unit labor costs in the first half of the year played a significant role in the high course of services inflation, while the slowdown in the tourism sector restricts these effects to some extent. In this respect, the underlying trend of services inflation exhibits a limited deceleration.
4.    Annual core goods inflation fell by 0.15 points to 8.67 percent in August.  Annual inflation crept up in durable goods, but decreased in other groups. Lagged effects of the exchange rate on annual core goods inflation display a gradual decline. However, following the July depreciation in the Turkish lira, the underlying trend in core goods exhibited a slight increase in this period.
5.    In sum, the slowdown in aggregate demand contributes to the gradual fall in core inflation. With the help of falling food prices, headline inflation is expected to display a decline in the short term. However, the recent tax adjustment in fuel prices and other cost factors limit the improvement in inflation.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6.    Second-quarter TurkStat data indicate that the GDP grew by an annual 3.1 percent. Adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects, growth has lost some momentum in the second quarter, up only by 0.3 percent after seeing a modest 0.7 percent increase in the first quarter. Investments remained sluggish while private and public spending provided a major boost to growth. The spillovers of the tourism slump became more pervasive in the second quarter, causing net exports to have a heightened negative impact on growth.
7.    Recent data releases and indicators for the third quarter point to a deceleration in economic activity. Calendar and seasonally-adjusted industrial production dipped both monthly and annually due to the domestic turbulence of July and the extended Ramadan holiday. This plunge is in part attributed to both the loss of working days caused by this holiday extension (bridge-day effects) and the drop in effective working days following July 15. In fact, recent indicators suggest that the recovery in August and September partly compensated for July’s output loss. Nevertheless, third-quarter industrial production is expected to be lower than in the second quarter.
8.    The increased EU demand continues to foster exports. Despite geopolitically-driven negative effects on external demand, Turkey’s flexibility in market diversification remains supportive of exports. Recent data on external trade signal that non-gold exports were up in August, offsetting the July descent. Yet, spillovers from the troubled tourism industry into net exports were more pronounced in the summer months. The tourism slump is likely to have a short-lived negative impact on the current account balance, but the lagged pass-through of terms-of-trade developments and the moderate course of consumer loans help to improve the current account balance. Meanwhile, commodity prices are expected to become gradually less accommodative for the current account deficit in the coming months.
9.    In June, seasonally-adjusted unemployment rates were up month-on-month due to narrowing non-farm employment. Thus, with the deteriorating employment outlook, unemployment rates jumped for the second month in a row. The employment decline spread across all industries. Industrial and construction employment dropped while services employment saw a weakening growth. In light of actual data and leading indicators, unemployment rates are anticipated to surge in the third quarter. Moreover, the SSI data indicate that the stagnant tourism industry continues to weigh on services employment as of June.
10.    In sum, economic activity is expected to post a quarterly fall in the third quarter. However, it is envisaged that the negative impact of the downturn in tourism on growth will be more restricted and domestic demand will start to recover on the back of accommodative incentives and measures.
Monetary Policy and Risks 
11.    The Committee assesses that current financial conditions are tight. The rise in global risk appetite helps to ease financial conditions, but loan standards remain tight. The gradual fall in the marginal funding rate partly passed through into loan and deposit rates. Loans are likely to see a moderate recovery over the upcoming period with the support coming from accommodative macroprudential measures.
12.    Recently released data and indicators regarding the third quarter display a deceleration in the economic activity. Unemployment rates which have been on the rise for the second consecutive month due to the worsening employment outlook confirm the economic slowdown. However, leading indicators imply that the significant slowdown in industrial production observed in July is not permanent. Despite the adverse effects of geopolitical developments on external demand, exports of goods to EU members remain strong. Restored relations with Russia may also support external demand gradually. Accordingly, exports of goods are expected to provide further contributions to growth in the upcoming period. Domestic demand is likely to start recovering by the fourth quarter on account of accommodative incentives and measures.
13.    In terms of global economic developments, low levels of advanced economy interest rates and commodity prices continue to affect the Turkish economy favorably. Although the uncertainty over global monetary policies have somewhat heightened, emerging economies continue to attract portfolio inflows. 
14.    In light of these developments and considering its contribution to the effectiveness of monetary policy, the Committee decided to take a measured and prudent step towards simplification. The ultimate aim of simplification is to achieve a narrow and symmetrical corridor and provide funding via a single rate. The simplification of the monetary policy is planned to be finalized within a reasonable schedule. The pace and timing of simplification will depend on the developments regarding inflation and financial stability.
15.    Inflation was down in August owing to improving indicators for unprocessed food and core inflation. The lagged effects of cumulative exchange rate movements on annual inflation eased further. However, the implications of the Turkish lira’s July depreciation for core goods and the pressures from unit labor costs and rigidities on services caused the underlying core inflation to remain high. In spite of gains from lower imported-input costs, the underlying inflation improved only marginally. For the upcoming period, the slowing aggregate demand may contribute to the gradual decline in core inflation while falling food prices are expected to pull inflation down in the short term. Nevertheless, adjustments in fuel taxes and other cost-related developments put upward pressure on inflation and require the maintenance of a cautious monetary policy stance.
16.    In the upcoming period, the monetary policy stance will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained.
17.    Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
18.    Sustained fiscal discipline has become essential in reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years. In the current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the gains from maintaining and further advancing these achievements are significant. Any measure to provide permanent fiscal discipline and reduction in the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels."

20 October 2016
DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Participating Committee Members
Murat Çetinkaya (Governor), Ahmet Faruk Aysan, Erkan Kilimci, Emrah Şener, Murat Uysal, Abdullah Yavaş.
 
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been kept at 8.25 percent, and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.25 percent,
b) One-week repo rate has been kept at 7.5 percent,
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been kept at 9.75 percent.
Recently released data and indicators regarding the third quarter display a deceleration in the economic activity. Reduced tightness in monetary conditions and the recent macroprudential measures support the overall financial conditions. The lagged effects of the terms of trade developments and the moderate course of consumer loans limit the widening in the current account balance driven by the decline in tourism revenues. Demand from the European Union economies continues to contribute positively to exports. With the supportive measures and incentives provided recently, domestic demand is expected to recover starting from the final quarter. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly.
The slowdown in aggregate demand contributes to the gradual fall in core inflation. Yet, the recent developments in exchange rates and other cost factors restrain the improvement in inflation outlook and thus necessitate the maintenance of a cautious monetary policy stance.
In light of these assessments, the Committee decided to keep the interest rates at current levels. The Committee stated that the direction and the timing of the next step in the monetary policy simplification process will be data dependent.
Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

2016,27 October 2016,SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING,"No: 2016-45
27 October 2016
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING 
Meeting Date: 20 October 2016
Inflation Developments
1.    In September, consumer prices went up by 0.18 percent, while annual consumer inflation fell by 0.77 points to 7.28 percent. As stated in the Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting of September, being driven by unprocessed food prices, the deceleration in food inflation continued. Moreover, weakening demand conditions also supported the disinflation process. On the other hand, the tax rise in fuel products curbed the improvement in inflation through direct and indirect effects. Core indicators’ annual inflation declined while their underlying trends somewhat improved in this period.
2.    Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages decreased by 2.03 points to 4.16 percent due mainly to the decline in prices of fresh fruits and vegetables. Meanwhile, inflation in food items excluding fresh fruits and vegetables maintained its favorable course. Leading indicators regarding October suggest some increase in food inflation. On the energy front, prices increased on account of rising taxes on fuel products. Annual energy inflation climbed to 4.56 percent. Recent developments in the exchange rate and international oil prices are envisaged to push October energy inflation upwards, yet this adverse effect is likely to be partly offset by the reduction in natural gas prices at the start of the month.
3.    Prices of services increased by 0.89 percent, and annual services inflation inched up by 0.11 points to 8.19 percent in September. Annual inflation increased in transport services; remained flat in rent, and decreased in other sub-groups in this period. Inflation in the restaurant-hotel group decelerated further due to the favorable course of food prices stemming from the contraction in tourism, whereas prices of transport services witnessed an upsurge amid fuel price hikes. In this respect, the underlying trend of services inflation exhibited an uptick.
4.    Annual core goods inflation fell by 1.70 points to 6.97 percent in September. Being more evident in durable goods, annual inflation decreased in all subgroups. The fall in core goods inflation is attributed to the waning cumulative effects of the exchange rate coupled with the deceleration in domestic demand. Accordingly, the underlying trend in core goods exhibited a remarkable slowdown in this period.
5.    In sum, the slowdown in aggregate demand contributes to the gradual fall in core inflation. However, exchange rate developments and other cost factors limit the improvement in inflation outlook.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6.    Recent data releases and indicators for the third quarter point to deceleration in economic activity. The second-quarter plunge in industrial production has deepened due to the sharp drop in July. This output fall in July is largely attributed to the demand-side effects of the domestic turbulence as well as to the loss of working days caused by the Ramadan holiday and the incidents of July 15. In fact, industrial production recovered by a rapid 9.4 percent month-on-month in August, confirming that July’s output loss was not a good indicator of the underlying trend. Both PMI indicators for new orders and output and the manufacturing industry capacity utilization rate edged upward in September. Notwithstanding the upbeat outlook suggested by survey indicators, production may see a renewed slowdown due to bridge-day effects caused by the extended holiday for the Sacrifice Feast in September, leading to a quarter-on-quarter decline in industrial production in the third quarter.
7.    Domestic demand is expected to pick up by the fourth quarter amid accommodative incentives and measures. July’s domestic tensions dampened final domestic demand to a great extent through both consumer and investment spending. In the July-August period, the production and imports of consumer goods and the consumption of durable goods were markedly down from the second quarter. On the investment front, data on the production and imports of machinery and equipment showed that investments remained weak over the third quarter. An indicator for construction activity, the production and imports of nonmetallic minerals declined, suggesting that construction investments slowed in the third quarter.
8.    Recent data signal that domestic demand started to rebound in the fourth quarter. Consumer loans have inched up in recent months thanks to more accommodative monetary conditions and other measures in place, confirming expectations of an upturn for the final quarter. Restoration of producer and consumer confidence due to waning uncertainties and demand-stimulating policies will be the main drivers of economic recovery in the upcoming period.
9.    Growing EU demand continued to bolster exports. Turkey’s flexibility in market diversification continues to cushion exports against the negative effects of geopolitical tensions on external demand. Yet, recent data show that exports and imports of goods were largely affected by the July turbulence. Despite some recovery in August and September, trade of goods declined in the third quarter. Spillovers from the troubled tourism industry into net exports were more pronounced in the summer months. The tourism slump continues to have a negative impact on the current account balance, which, however, is somewhat alleviated by the lagged pass-through of terms-of-trade developments and the moderate course of consumer loans. However, commodity prices are expected to become gradually less accommodative for the current account deficit in the coming months.
10.    The deteriorating labor market outlook of May and June continued into July due to falling industrial employment, causing unemployment rates to remain on the rise. Employment gains in services lost more pace amid sluggish economic activity. Across non-farm industries, the previous quarter’s decline in construction employment came to a halt. Additionally, according to the SSI data on registered employees, the employment fall in major tourism industries (accommodation, travel agents and tour operators) turned around in July. Moreover, the PMI for industrial employment signals no additional deterioration for September yet remains low. Given the weak economic activity and leading indicators for employment, unemployment rates are expected to climb further in the third quarter.
11.    In sum, economic activity is expected to recede in the third quarter. However, domestic demand is envisaged to pick up in the upcoming period on the back of less uncertainty, restored producer and consumer confidence, incentives stimulating domestic demand and recovering consumer loans. 
Monetary Policy and Risks
12.    The Committee evaluated the medium-term projections to be published in the October Inflation Report. In the third quarter of the year, inflation recorded a decline on account of the improvements in unprocessed food and core inflation indicators. While the lagged effects of the cumulative exchange rate developments on annual inflation continued to wane, slowing aggregate demand supported disinflation and the underlying trend of core inflation improved. However, the tax rise in fuel products restrained the recovery in inflation through energy and transport prices. Although the developments in TL-denominated import prices are expected to push inflation upwards, the mild course of aggregate demand is projected to support the gradual decline in core inflation. Moreover, forecasts are based on the assumption that the year-end food inflation in 2016 and 2017 will be lower than the projections of the previous Report amid the tourism-induced slowdown in food demand and the actions taken by the Food Committee.
13.    Accordingly, the year-end consumer inflation forecast for 2016 remained unchanged as downside and upside effects on inflation cancelled each other out.  On the other hand, end-2017 consumer inflation forecast was revised upwards by 0.5 points as the upside effects driven by import prices outweighed the effects of the downward revision in the output gap and food inflation.
14.    Overall financial conditions is buoyed by macroprudential arrangements and reduced tightness in monetary conditions thanks to the CBRT’s policy actions. The gradual fall in the marginal funding rate has partially passed through to loan and deposit rates. Supported also by the recently enforced macroprudential measures, consumer loans displayed recovery in the last couple of months. On the other hand, due to global and geopolitical developments that had effects on domestic financial markets, tightness in loan conditions has not witnessed a notable decline yet. As the downgrade of Turkey’s sovereign credit rating to below investment grade at the end of September was largely anticipated by markets, the reaction of financial markets remained limited. Even though this downgrade weighs on external funding costs, loan conditions are supported by liquidity measures, macroprudential arrangements and other incentives. On the other hand, the CBRT may introduce accommodative adjustments to required reserves and other liquidity instruments in case of a higher-than-expected tightness in financial conditions.
15.    The latest data indicate a significant slowdown in economic activity in the third quarter. Recent accommodative measures and incentives are projected to stimulate a rebound in domestic demand starting from the last quarter. Accordingly, economic activity is expected to register a mild growth in the remainder of 2016 and throughout 2017. However, the pace of the recovery in tourism revenues, the global economic outlook, the uncertainties regarding the monetary policies of advanced economies and geopolitical developments pose downside risks to economic activity. The CBRT will continue to monitor closely the impacts of the developments in economic activity on price stability and financial stability.
16.    There are both upside and downside risks to inflation forecasts. Inflation may settle on a lower-than-expected path, should economic activity recover at a slower-than-envisioned pace in the upcoming period. On the other hand, uncertainties regarding oil prices and global markets pose an upside risk to inflation through the cost channel. Meanwhile, the volatility in food prices pose risks in both directions for 2017. The CBRT will closely monitor the developments affecting inflation and take necessary policy measures to achieve price stability.
17.    Leading indicators for the third quarter of 2016 point to a mild improvement in global economic activity. However, due to the historically low levels of global growth and trade volume, interest rates in advanced economies remain low. Accordingly, risk appetite towards emerging economies has followed a robust course in recent months. On the other hand, uncertainties regarding global monetary policies cause fluctuations in portfolio inflows. In fact, amid strengthened perceptions about the Fed’s possible rate hike coupled with the uncertainties regarding the monetary policies of other advanced economies, portfolio flows towards emerging economies have recently trended downwards after a surge following the previous reporting period.
18.    Against this background, marginal funding rate, which was gradually lowered under the simplification process since March 2016, was kept constant in October. The completion of the simplification will ensure funding via a single rate, thereby bringing short-term market rates closer to the CBRT funding rate. Simplification is believed to contribute to the effectiveness of the transmission mechanism by providing better assessment of the monetary policy stance. Therefore, simplification of the monetary policy will be finalized within a reasonable schedule. The direction and the timing of simplification will depend on the developments regarding inflation and financial stability.
19.    Despite experiencing significant external shocks in recent years, the adopted policy framework proved successful in containing the deterioration in inflation and inflation expectations. However, price stability is yet to be achieved. Ten years of experience in inflation targeting showed that combatting inflation requires joint efforts. Thus, to reduce inflation to the 5-percent target permanently, all institutions must fulfill their duties under a holistic approach by also taking structural factors into account. In this respect, actions taken by the Food Committee set an invaluable precedent. In the upcoming period, the CBRT will contribute to these efforts by undertaking extensive studies to raise awareness regarding structural issues in inflation dynamics.
20.    In the upcoming period, the monetary policy stance will continue to depend on the inflation outlook. The CBRT will maintain its cautious monetary policy stance by taking into account the developments regarding inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation.
21.    Developments in fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
22.    In recent years, sustaining fiscal discipline has become one of the major factors in reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks. In the current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the gains from maintaining and further advancing these achievements are significant. Any measure to provide permanent fiscal discipline and reduction in the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping the interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels."

12 November 2016
Press Release on the Maximum Interest Rates for Credit Cards in Q1 2017
Taking into consideration the recent economic developments and market conditions, the calculation method of maximum interest rates for credit card borrowings has been changed. According to the new method, maximum interest rates for credit card borrowings will be determined by taking into account interest rates of consumer loans as well as additional risks and costs of credit cards.
Accordingly, the monthly maximum interest rates that banks can charge on Turkish lira and foreign exchange credit card borrowing have been decreased. To be effective from 1 January 2017, for the credit card borrowings, the monthly maximum contractual interest rate will be 1.84 percent for the Turkish lira and 1.47 percent for foreign exchange transactions, whereas the monthly maximum overdue interest rate will be 2.34 percent for the Turkish lira and 1.97 percent for foreign exchange transactions.
Banks are not allowed to charge higher interest rates than the rates announced by the CBRT for credit cards. Banks are free to determine their respective rates at their own discretion provided that they are below these ceilings. The maximum contractual and overdue interest rates for credit card transactions for the three-month period starting on 1 April 2017 will be announced by the CBRT prior to that date.
Banks in Turkey, as is the case in other countries, charge higher interest rates for credit card borrowing than they do for consumer loans. The CBRT therefore advises credit card holders with short-term credit needs to seek a consumer loan rather than borrowing on personal credit cards.

Recently released data indicate that the economic activity has decelerated in the third quarter, before posting a partial recovery for the final quarter. Demand from the European Union economies continues to contribute positively to exports. With the supportive measures and incentives provided recently, the recovery in the economic activity is expected to continue at a moderate pace. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly.
Exchange rate movements due to recently heightened global uncertainty and the increase in oil prices pose upside risks on the inflation outlook. Yet, the aggregate demand developments restrain these effects. Developments will be closely monitored in order to make a sound assessment regarding the net impact of these factors.
Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

27 December 2016
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 20 December 2016
Inflation Developments    
1.    In November, consumer prices went up by 0.52 percent, while annual consumer inflation fell by 0.16 points to 7.0 percent. As stated in the Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting of November, annual food inflation receded considerably, while energy inflation increased due to the depreciation in the Turkish lira. On the other hand, the effect of recent exchange rate movements on core inflation indicators remained relatively limited due to the slowdown in aggregate demand. Thus, the underlying trends of core indicators displayed a practically flat course.
2.    Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages fell by 1.65 points to 3.55 percent, which was led by the falling unprocessed food prices due to the decline in the prices of vegetables. Annual processed food inflation remained on the decline. Leading indicators regarding December suggest an uptick in annual food inflation on account of the unprocessed food inflation. Energy prices increased by 1.05 points in November and the depreciation in the Turkish lira resulted in overall price hikes in the sector. Thus, annual energy inflation rose by 1.44 points to 6.15 percent. This rise is expected to continue in December due to the uptrend in the exchange rate coupled with oil prices. In addition to food and energy groups, recent tax adjustments introduced to some items, chiefly tobacco products, is envisaged to put a noticeable upside pressure on December inflation. 
3.    Prices of services recorded an uptick by 0.29 percent, and annual services inflation crept up by 0.14 points to 7.94 percent in November. Annual inflation decreased in transport and rent, but increased in other sub-groups in this period. Consequences of the slowdown in domestic demand and the tourism sector were evident in the prices of services, while some groups reflected the effect of depreciation of the Turkish lira as well. In this respect, the underlying trend of services inflation registered a slight increase. 
4.    Annual core goods inflation inched down by 0.22 points to 5.92 percent in November. Inflation plummeted in the clothing group, but increased in durable goods. Recent exchange rate developments had a limited effect on durable goods in November. This month was marked by a notable depreciation in the Turkish lira, while aggregate demand conditions confined the deterioration in the underlying trend of core goods inflation.
5.    In sum, the effect of the recent rise in exchange rate and oil prices on inflation remained relatively limited due to aggregate demand conditions. 
Factors Affecting Inflation
6.    The GDP narrowed by 1.8 percent year-on-year in the third quarter and grew by 2.2 percent through the first nine months of 2016. The Committee assessed that the underlying growth of economic activity is not as slow as third-quarter GDP data suggest. In fact, mid-July incidents and the loss of working days caused by extended religious holidays had far more implications than normal calendar effects. Adjusted for such effects, the economy is estimated to register a year-on-year expansion rather than a contraction in the third quarter.  
7.    In the third quarter, value-added was up in construction but down in agriculture, industry and services on a yearly basis. On the spending front, public consumption provided further support to growth. Meanwhile, construction investments contributed to annual growth positively whereas machinery and equipment investments and private spending declined. Domestic demand continued to prop up growth, albeit to a lesser extent, while the effects of the tourism slump became more pronounced and net exports provided an increased negative contribution to growth. 
8.    Recent data indicate that economic activity rebounded somewhat in the fourth quarter after the third-quarter deceleration. With working day losses led by extended religious holidays counterbalanced and the underlying trend on a modest upward track, industrial output increased in October. Data on the production and exports of electricity and vehicles point to further growth in industrial output for November. Thus, industrial production is likely to post a quarterly gain in the fourth quarter thanks to the base effect from unworked days. However, apart from the very much technical recovery driven by working day effects, the economy recovery seems to be a moderate one yet to spread across all sectors. 
9.    Economic activity is expected to recover further amid accommodative incentives and measures. This estimation is supported by the data on mortgage and auto markets. Thanks to more accommodative monetary conditions and other newly-adopted measures, consumer loans have picked up in recent months, bolstering the prospects for a gradual improvement. Moreover, the public sector is expected to provide further investment support to growth in the coming months.
10.    The growing EU demand continues to stimulate total exports, the auto industry in particular. Turkey’s flexibility in market diversification continues to cushion exports against the negative effects of geopolitical tensions on external demand. Furthermore, the newly-restored relations with Russia translated into a boost for exports. The gloomy tourism industry continues to have a negative impact on the current account balance, which, however, is alleviated by the lagged pass-through of terms-of-trade developments and the moderate course of loans. However, commodity prices are expected to become gradually less accommodative for the current account deficit in the upcoming period.
11.    The labor market decline that began in May paused in September amid rising nonfarm employment. The growth in nonfarm employment was mostly driven by the increased construction employment. Meanwhile, services and industrial employment picked up only modestly. Leading indicators such as new job vacancies and unemployment insurance claims suggest that employment remains subdued and unemployment rates will remain at high levels.  
12.    In sum, economic activity edged up in the fourth quarter and is expected to record a moderate growth in 2016. However, the potential impact of recent global and geopolitical developments on financial conditions and the lack of any signs of a rosy tourism outlook remain a downside risk to the pace of economic recovery.  
Monetary Policy and Risks 
13.    Consumer loans continue to improve amid falling interest rates and macroprudential measures. Nevertheless, due to global and geopolitical spillovers into domestic financial markets, commercial loans remain weak. Measures taken by the Economic Coordination Committee to uplift the real sector are expected to help commercial loans increase in the upcoming period.   
14.    The ongoing uncertainty over global monetary policies and enhanced Fed rate hike prospects lead to financial market volatility and portfolio outflows in emerging economies. To counteract their negative spillovers into exchange rates and lending standards, the CBRT maintains a stabilizing stance for FX liquidity and a supportive macroprudential policy stance. 
15.    Domestic demand is expected to start recovering by the fourth quarter amid accommodative incentives and measures. Yet, global market turmoil and geopolitical risks keep a firm lid on the pace of economic recovery. Thus, economic activity is likely to grow moderately in the upcoming period. The CBRT will continue to monitor the developments in economic activity and their implications for price stability and financial stability. The Committee stated that adopting structural reforms might boost the economy’s growth potential to a large extent.
16.    Exchange rate movements and rising oil prices fueled by the recently heightened global uncertainty pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook. Recent price movements and current weather forecasts add to the upside risks to food prices for the coming months, which, however, are curbed by aggregate demand. The Committee agreed that future developments should be closely monitored to determine the net effects of these factors on the inflation outlook for 2017.
17.    Against this background, the Committee kept the marginal funding rate constant in December and maintains its position that the simplification should be completed within an appropriate time frame. The gains that were planned through simplification are performing to a great extent. The direction and the timing of the next step toward simplification will depend on the developments in inflation and financial stability. 
18.    Monetary policy decisions will depend on the inflation outlook in the upcoming period. The CBRT will maintain its cautious stance in light of future developments in inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation.
19.    Developments in fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
20.    In recent years, sustaining fiscal discipline has become one of the major factors in reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks. In the current environment of high global uncertainty, it is critical to maintain and further enhance these achievements. Any measure to provide permanent fiscal discipline and to reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping the interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels."

DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Participating Committee Members
Erdem Başçı (Governor), Ahmet Faruk Aysan, Murat Çetinkaya, Turalay Kenç, Necati Şahin, Abdullah Yavaş, Mehmet Yörükoğlu. 
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been kept at 11.25 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been kept at 10.75 percent, and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.5 percent,
b) One-week repo rate has been reduced from 8.25 percent to 7.75 percent,
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been kept at 12.75 percent.
Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans will contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. External demand remains weak, while domestic demand contributes to growth moderately. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the announced structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly.
The tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures continue to have favorable impact on inflation, especially inflation excluding energy and food (core inflation) indicators, and inflation expectations. Moreover, declining commodity prices, in particular oil prices, contribute to disinflation. In light of these positive developments, the Committee has decided on a measured cut in the one week repo rate.
Under the current monetary policy stance, the Committee anticipates that inflation will decline to levels close to the target by mid-2015. Yet, a more persistent reduction in inflation necessitates a cautious approach in monetary policy. In this context, future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the improvements in the inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be closely monitored and the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

27 January 2015
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 20 January 2015     
Inflation Developments
1. In December, consumer prices edged down by 0.44 percent and annual inflation fell approximately by 1 point to 8.17 percent at the year-end. This fall was mainly driven by energy and food prices, yet inflation lost pace in almost all sub-groups. The decline in energy prices continued at a stronger pace in line with the international oil prices. The decline in the underlying trend in inflation got more apparent in services, but remained relatively limited in core goods.
2. Annual food inflation decreased by 1.64 points to 12.73 percent and stood close to the assumptions made in the October Inflation Report. The seasonally-adjusted data pointed to a partial correction in unprocessed food prices in the last four months, which was led particularly by fruits and vegetables. Similarly, despite the deceleration in the monthly inflation trend in processed food prices in December after a long while, the group’s annual inflation remained high with 13.16 percent. Indicators for January signal for a possible decline in the annual food inflation due to the unprocessed food group.
3. Energy prices remained on the decline and fell by 1.86 percent in December. The group’s annual inflation plummeted by 4.22 points to -1.54 percent, hitting the lowest level of the index history. The first-round effects of the decline in oil prices on energy prices appeared in fuel and bottled gas prices. Brent crude oil prices decreased approximately by USD 45 in the July-December period, and the direct effect of this decline on the consumer inflation through fuel and bottled gas prices was around -0.76 points in this period. This fall in these two items continued in January.
4. Annual core goods inflation receded approximately by 0.5 points to 8.89 percent. This was led by prices of durables and the high-rated decline in clothing prices. Prices of durable goods edged down by 0.30 percent in December, and the downtrend in the group’s annual inflation continued. The sustained mild course of the prices of durable goods accompanied by the gradual elimination of the cumulative exchange rate effects suggests a notable decline in core goods inflation in the first quarter.
5. Prices of services crept up by 0.18 percent and the group’s annual inflation receded by 0.22 points to 8.59 percent in the last month of the year. The rate of increase in the seasonally-adjusted prices of services saw a remarkable improvement in the last two months. Positive effects of the decline in fuel prices on the related groups of services continued with a slower pace in December. In addition, the inflation trend in other services followed a weaker course in the last two months. The notable fall in oil prices is expected to have further positive effects on the prices of services that are closely related to fuel prices.
6. The seasonally-adjusted data point to a sustained improvement in the underlying trend of core inflation indicators. The underlying trend in services inflation displays an evident decline, while the improvement in the trend of core goods inflation remained more limited.
Factors Affecting Inflation
7. Data announced for the final quarter of 2014 point to a moderate recovery for economic activity. Having decreased by a mere 0.1 percent month-on-month in November, industrial production fell by 0.9 percent from the third quarter during October-November. This development stems largely from the weak external demand as well as the volatility caused by shifting holidays and transportation production. On the other hand, the recovery observed in other leading indicators suggests that the information content of the industrial production regarding the underlying trend of the fourth quarter economic activity might be limited. In fact, there have been widespread increases across nonfarm employment recently. Moreover, the import volume index for non-gold intermediate goods grew strongly during October-November, while non-gold exports increased only modestly. Survey indicators also point to a more benign outlook for the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. The Business Tendency Survey (BTS) and PMI indicators for manufacturing have shown a more robust growth in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter, while the BTS’ three-month-ahead expectation for production and question of three-month-ahead total orders continued to improve in the fourth quarter. In this regard, the underlying trend of economic activity is considered to have recovered moderately. 
8. Data on the expenditure side point to some increase in private domestic demand for the fourth quarter. During October-November, the production of consumer goods was higher than the previous quarter’s average, whereas their imports were lower. An indicator for investments, the production of machinery-equipment remained unchanged quarter-on-quarter, while its imports increased. Domestic sales of automobiles and light commercial vehicles grew robustly in the second half of 2014. Mineral production and construction employment, a proxy for construction investments, have registered moderate increases. Loans, on the other hand, remain on a modest upward track. Against this background, domestic demand is expected to recover further in the fourth quarter. The improved investment trend contains positive signals for investments over the upcoming period, but the weak consumer confidence poses a downside risk.
9. External demand indicators point to no improvement for the fourth quarter of 2014 in the rebalancing process based on goods excluding gold, which ground to a halt in the third quarter. Europe’s slowing economy and geopolitical tensions have caused exports to lose some pace. Thus, during October-November, exports excluding gold increased only slightly from the previous quarter, whereas imports excluding gold picked up at a relatively faster pace. However, the favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans will support the improvement in the current account balance.
10. Having weakened after the first quarter of 2014, nonfarm employment posted notable gains during August-October period. Yet, this nonfarm employment growth has been balanced off by the growing nonfarm labor force participation recently, causing unemployment to remain steady. Employment growth was evident across all nonfarm sectors. Specifically, industrial and construction sectors are still experiencing growth in employment, which started in August. The services sector also has contributed further to nonfarm employment growth. As of October, actual data and leading indicators signal some recovery in employment for the fourth quarter, but considering the increase in labor force participation, unemployment rates are not expected to decrease.
Monetary Policy and Risks
11. Loan growth is at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and the macroprudential measures. The composition of loans also continues to evolve in the desired direction. While the annual growth rate of consumer loans hovers around low levels, commercial loans remain relatively more robust. This loan composition not only limits medium-term inflationary pressures but also contributes to the improvement in the current account balance.
12. The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) expects the growth composition to change in favor of domestic demand in the upcoming period. Ongoing weakness in growth across European countries, the largest export market of Turkey, and geopolitical developments in neighboring countries limits the growth of exports. Yet, with improved financial conditions and income effect of falling oil prices, domestic demand may see some recovery. In sum, external demand remains weak whereas domestic demand contributes moderately to growth. This change in the growth composition might lead to a widening in the non-energy current account deficit to some extent but the overall current account deficit is expected to narrow further down thanks to the improvement in the energy trade balance.
13. Downside risks regarding economic activity continue to be important for the upcoming period. The lingering volatility across global financial markets and the sluggish course of confidence indices may cause private final demand to provide limited support to growth. In the case of an additional slowdown in external demand and a sizeable decline in global growth rates, the decrease in commodity prices will pull inflation down but at the same time lead to notable adverse effects on economic activity. Under such circumstances, the Committee will employ the policy tools to support the economic activity.
14. There are many factors that might have a favorable effect on the inflation outlook for 2015. The recovery of economic activity is likely to be a gradual one and aggregate demand developments are expected to support disinflation. The tight monetary policy stance and the macroprudential measures continue to have a favorable impact on inflation, especially on inflation excluding energy and food (core inflation) indicators. The adverse impact of cumulative exchange rate developments on annual inflation is also tapering off. Moreover, falling commodity prices, in particular oil prices, contribute to disinflation. In fact, there has been a notable decline in medium-term inflation expectations recently. In light of these positive developments, the Committee has decided on a measured cut in the one week repo rate.
15. Global financial markets have followed a volatile course recently. It was stated that capital flows to emerging markets may continue to be volatile in 2015. The ongoing uncertainty about the normalization of global monetary policies cause the global risk appetite and capital flows to be data-sensitive. The Committee stated that, against heightened global volatility, it would be helpful to pursue a flexible monetary policy in the short term and assessed that it would be appropriate to keep the overnight rates unchanged at this stage.
16. The Committee stated that using a flexible interest rate corridor would cushion the economy against the volatility in global markets. In this regard, inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be further closely monitored and the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained by keeping the yield curve flat until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook.
17. The meeting also included a discussion of the projections to be published in the Inflation Report. Under the current monetary policy stance, the Committee anticipates that inflation will decline to levels close to the target by mid-2015. Yet, a more persistent reduction in inflation necessitates a cautious approach in monetary policy. The Committee sees that a major opportunity has emerged to bring inflation down permanently in an environment where cost and demand factors are supportive of disinflation. Keeping inflation permanently at low levels might contribute to investments and potential growth. In this context, the Bank will continue to act decisively to bring down inflation and make future monetary policy decisions conditional on the pace of improvement in the inflation outlook.
18. Developments on the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes on administered prices. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently, have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
19. The Committee welcomed the development that the Medium Term Program incorporates disinflation as one of the main objectives. Moreover, it was indicated that the implementation of the announced structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. Any measure to ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels."

DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Participating Committee Members
Erdem Başçı (Governor), Ahmet Faruk Aysan, Murat Çetinkaya, Turalay Kenç, Necati Şahin, Abdullah Yavaş, Mehmet Yörükoğlu. 
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been reduced from 11.25 percent to 10.75 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been reduced from 10.75 percent to 10.25 percent, and borrowing rate has been reduced from 7.5 percent to 7.25 percent,
b) One-week repo rate has been reduced from 7.75 percent to 7.5 percent,
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been reduced from 12.75 percent to 12.25 percent.
Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. External demand remains weak, while domestic demand contributes to growth moderately. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the announced structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly.
The ongoing cautious monetary policy along with prudent fiscal and macroprudential policies are having a favorable impact on inflation, especially inflation excluding energy and food (core inflation indicators), and inflation expectations. The Committee anticipates that the core inflation will continue to decline. Yet, a more persistent reduction in inflation necessitates a cautious approach in monetary policy. Taking into account the elevated volatility in food and energy prices, the Committee decided to cut the interest rates at a measured scale.
Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the improvements in the inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be monitored closely and the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

28 February 2015
Press Release on the Maximum Interest Rates for Credit Cards in Q2 2015
The monthly maximum interest rates banks can charge on credit card borrowing in the second quarter of 2015 have been left unchanged.
The CBRT sets maximum interest rates for credit card borrowing under legal authority expressed most recently in the CBRT Communiqué No. 2014/5 on Maximum Interest Rates to be Applied to Credit Card Transactions published in the Official Gazette No: 29153 dated 22 October 2014. Accordingly, to be effective from 1 April 2015, for the credit card borrowings, the monthly maximum contractual interest rate is 2.02 percent for the Turkish lira and 1.62 percent for foreign exchange, whereas the monthly maximum overdue interest rate is 2.52 percent for the Turkish lira and 2.12 percent for foreign exchange.
Banks cannot charge higher interest rates than the rates announced by the CBRT for credit cards. Banks are free to determine their respective rates at their own discretion provided that they are below these ceilings. The maximum contractual and overdue interest rates for the three-month period starting on 1 July 2015 will be announced by the CBRT prior to that date. 
Banks in Turkey, as is the case in other countries, charge higher interest rates for credit card borrowing than they do for consumer loans. The CBRT therefore advises credit card holders with short-term credit needs to seek a consumer loan rather than borrowing on personal credit cards.

3 March 2015
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 24 February 2015     
Inflation Developments
1. In January, consumer prices increased by 1.10 percent and annual inflation fell by 0.93 point to 7.24 percent. This fall was mainly driven by energy and food prices, and inflation lost pace in almost all sub-groups except services. The decline in energy prices continued in line with falling international oil prices. The improvement in the underlying trend of core indicators was sustained due to core goods.
2. Annual food inflation decreased by 1.76 points to 10.97 percent. Although the seasonally-adjusted unprocessed food prices increased in January following the decline in the last four months, the group’s inflation fell to 9.39 percent. Processed food prices recorded a monthly upsurge, yet the group’s annual inflation receded to 12.56 percent also due to the high base. Being also affected by adverse weather conditions, the indicators for February signal a possible uptick in the annual food inflation due to the unprocessed food group.
3. Energy prices remained on the decline and fell by 0.78 percent in January. The group’s annual inflation dropped by 1.50 points to -3.04 percent, hitting the lowest level of the index history. The effects of the decline in oil prices on energy prices appeared in fuel and bottled gas prices, while the upsurge in municipal water tariffs was remarkable. Meanwhile, the increase in fuel prices after six months in February due to the depreciation in the Turkish lira and the rise in oil prices indicates that the contribution of energy group to the decline in annual consumer inflation will be restricted to some extent.
4. Annual core goods inflation edged down approximately by 0.3 points to 8.57 percent. This was led by prices of goods excluding clothing, particularly durable consumption goods. Although the group’s annual inflation decreased mostly owing to the base effect, prices surged across durables. In groups excluding durables and clothing, annual inflation decreased while there were increases in the monthly inflation. Recent exchange rate developments may restrict the fall in core goods inflation, yet a notable decline in core goods is expected in the first quarter.
5. Prices of services increased by 1.06 percent and the group’s annual inflation crept up by 0.14 points to 8.73 percent mainly due to communication and other services groups. Moreover, maintenance-repair and healthcare services also saw an increase in inflation in this period. Additionally, the annual inflation in the restaurants-hotels group maintained its high course owing to the negative developments in food prices. Accordingly, the seasonally-adjusted data exhibit an increase in the underlying trend of services inflation.
6. In sum, January was marked by a sustained improvement in the underlying trend of core inflation indicators and favorable figures in energy inflation amid the lingering fall in international oil prices. Core inflation is projected to decline further in the upcoming period in line with the maintained reasonable levels in inflation trends.
Factors Affecting Inflation
7. Data announced for the final quarter of 2014 point to a limited recovery for economic activity. Industrial production increased 1.2 percent in December, but fell by 0.5 percent quarter-on-quarter due to the volatility in other transport vehicles and the Feast of the Sacrifice. The dampening effects of the weak external demand have become more evident, while domestic demand has yet to accelerate adequately, which keeps economic activity from a robust recovery.
8. According to data on the expenditure side, in the final quarter of 2014, the production of consumer goods was higher than the previous quarter’s average, while the decline in imports of consumer goods was limited. Domestic sales of automobiles and home appliances grew robustly. Loans, on the other hand, remained on a modest upward track. The weak consumer confidence was a limiting factor on consumer spending in this quarter. While the production of machinery-equipment, an indicator for investments, fell slightly, its imports increased significantly. Mineral production and construction employment, variables related to construction investments, have registered some recovery. The investment trend that improved from the first half of 2014 contains positive signals for investments. Against this background, private domestic demand is believed to have increased moderately in the fourth quarter.
9. External demand indicators suggest that net exports did not contribute to growth in the fourth quarter of 2014. The slowing growth rates across Turkey’s major trading partners and geopolitical tensions dampened export growth, while the modest recovery in domestic demand led to an increase in import demand. Thus, there has been no improvement for the fourth quarter of 2014 in the rebalancing process based on goods excluding gold. However, the favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance.
10. Data available for the first quarter of 2015 indicate that the fourth-quarter outlook will persist. January’s PMI and February’s Business Tendency Survey (BTS) indicators point to no acceleration in production. The increased volatility in financial markets and the weak consumer confidence restrain domestic demand. Moreover, external trade data for January show that exports remain weak due to external demand.
11. According to seasonally adjusted data, unemployment picked up in November 2014 due to sluggish nonfarm employment. Construction employment has been recovering since August, yet the recent growth in industrial employment has been balanced off by a decline. The services sector has continued to contribute to nonfarm employment. PMI and BTS survey indicators that reflect actual and expected employment figures for firms remain elevated as of January 2015 and signal no additional worsening for industrial employment. However, the limited increase in industrial production suggests that risks are on the downside for industrial employment. As of January 2015, indicators for the labor market point to an weak employment growth and a stagnant unemployment rate.
Monetary Policy and Risks
12. Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The composition of loans also continues to evolve in the desired direction. The annual growth rate of commercial loans is quite strong relative to that of consumer loans. This loan composition not only limits medium-term inflationary pressures but also contributes to the improvement in the current account balance.
13. The weak external demand caused by the sluggish growth across European countries, the largest export market for Turkey, and geopolitical developments in neighboring countries limits the growth of exports. Yet, domestic demand may see some gradual recovery, also with the income effect of lower oil prices. In sum, external demand remains weak while domestic demand contributes to growth moderately. Thus, the growth composition may change in favor of domestic demand in the upcoming period. This change in the growth composition might lead to a widening in the non-energy current account deficit to some extent but the overall current account deficit is expected to narrow further down thanks to the improvement in the energy trade balance.
14. Downside risks regarding economic activity continue to be important for the upcoming period. The lingering volatility across global financial markets and the sluggish course of confidence indices may cause private final demand to provide limited support to growth. In the case of an additional slowdown in external demand and a sizeable decline in global growth rates, the decrease in commodity prices will pull inflation down but at the same time lead to notable adverse effects on domestic economic activity. Under such circumstances, the Committee will employ the policy tools to support the economy.
15. The ongoing cautious monetary policy along with prudent fiscal and macroprudential policies are having a favorable impact on inflation, especially on inflation excluding energy and food (core inflation indicators). In this regard, the Committee anticipates that core inflation will continue to decline. Moreover, lower level of commodity prices, particularly oil, continue to support disinflation. However, the recent volatility in oil prices and exchange rates might limit the support provided by energy group to disinflation. Meanwhile, food prices may see some volatility, especially in unprocessed food, due to weather conditions.
16. Having the foreseen decline in inflation to be more persistent is important for maintaining the progress made in inflation over the last decade. A persistent decrease in inflation will contribute to the fall in long-term real interest rates by leading to declines in risk and inflation premia. These developments will have a favorable impact on public balance and potential growth. In this context, a more persistent reduction in inflation necessitates a cautious approach in monetary policy. Taking into account the heightened volatility in food and energy prices, the Committee cut the interest rates but with a cautious approach kept the rate cuts at a measured scale. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the improvements in the inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be monitored closely and the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook.
17. Global financial markets continue to follow a volatile course. The ongoing uncertainty about global monetary policies cause the global risk appetite and capital flows to be data-sensitive. The Federal Reserve’s (Fed) policy normalization process and the European Central Bank’s new quantitative easing program have been major factors affecting financial markets. The Committee emphasized that the CBRT has a rich set of policy tools to use against an earlier-than-expected policy rate hike by the Fed. Yet, higher risk of deflation in developed countries increases the probability of postponement in the normalization of monetary policies. The Committee pointed out that, in an environment of continued uncertainty over global financial markets and economic activity, prudential borrowing is crucial to limit the accumulation of macro-financial risks.
18. Developments on the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes on administered prices. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently, have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
19. The Committee welcomed the development that the Medium Term Program incorporates disinflation as one of the main objectives. Moreover, it was indicated that the implementation of the announced structural reforms would contribute significantly to potential growth. Any measure to ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels."

The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 10.75 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 10.25 percent, and borrowing rate at 7.25 percent,

24 March 2015
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 17 March 2015     
Inflation Developments  
1. In February, consumer prices increased by 0.71 percent and annual inflation rose by 0.31 points to 7.55 percent. This increase was mainly driven by food prices. The decline in the annual inflation of non-food consumer prices has continued. Underlying inflation rose in services but fell in core goods. Overall, core inflation indicators continued to improve.
2. Annual inflation in food and nonalcoholic beverages surged by 2.73 points to 13.70 percent amid developments in unprocessed food prices. This period was marked by escalating vegetable prices caused by adverse weather conditions and supply-related upsurges in meat prices. On the other hand, despite the receding annual inflation in processed food prices, the monthly trend of increase remained elevated in this subcategory. Indicators for March signal that the annual food inflation will remain high.
3. Annual energy inflation remained modest with a growth rate of -1.92 percent despite rising fuel prices and water tariffs. Yet, energy prices are expected to have a less constraining effect on annual consumer inflation due to soaring prices of fuel and bottled gas amid the Turkish lira depreciation in March.
4. Prices of services were up by 0.68 percent in February while annual services inflation fell by 0.10 points to 8.63 percent. In this period, changes in food and oil prices as well as exchange rates exerted cost pressures on prices of services. Accordingly, the monthly rate of increase in catering prices accelerated due to rising food prices. Moreover, having declined since November, prices of transport services picked up slightly amid higher fuel prices while prices of some items sensitive to exchange rates surged notably. As a result, services inflation remained elevated throughout February.
5. Annual core goods inflation decreased by 1.78 points to 6.79 percent in February. Annual inflation was down across all main categories, particularly in durable goods. The decline in annual core goods inflation was largely driven by base effects. Meanwhile, the monthly rate of increase in prices of core goods excluding clothing reflected the pass-through of the Turkish lira depreciation, although the recent weakening of domestic demand conditions has partially balanced off the exchange rate-driven cost pressures. Accordingly, the underlying trend of core goods inflation fell to a modest level in February.
6. To sum up, (core) inflation indicators excluding energy and food continued to decline in February. Yet, the current course of food prices and the exchange rate developments are the key risk factors regarding the inflation outlook.  
Factors Affecting Inflation
7. Industrial production recorded a monthly decline of 1.4 percent in January. This was largely attributed to the slowdown in domestic demand growth and the weakening external demand as well as to the setbacks in the supply chain and construction activities caused by January’s adverse weather conditions. February’s PMI and Business Tendency Survey (BTS) data suggest that the weak course of industrial production has continued lately.
8. Data on the expenditure side suggest that demand conditions do not yet reveal a significant recovery. In January, the production of consumer goods was lower than the previous quarter’s average, while the imports of consumer goods were on the rise. In this period, domestic sales of home appliances dropped. Similarly, sales of automobiles were down from the fourth-quarter average during the January-February period. Consumer confidence continued to weaken amid uncertainty over global markets. Among indicators for investments, the production and imports of machinery-equipment fell in January from the previous quarter’s average. The BTS investment tendency indicator, which recorded a recovery over the second half of 2014, has not gained a steady footing as of the first quarter of 2015. Among variables related to construction investments, the production of minerals declined whereas the imports of minerals increased. After an upsurge starting in the second half of 2014, construction employment flattened in December. In sum, recent indicators suggest that private domestic demand has contributed moderately to growth albeit at a slower pace in the first quarter of 2015.
9. According to the real measures of external trade indicators, the rebalancing process has not shown a notable improvement in January. During this period, non-gold exports were weaker than their fourth-quarter average, while non-gold imports were flat. The slowdown in exports was mostly due to the weak growth across Turkey’s major trading partners. However, the developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. Thus, the current account balance is expected to improve further throughout 2015.
10. In December 2014, both total and nonfarm unemployment decreased. Although there was no robust employment growth in this period, the flat labor participation rate helped to bring unemployment rates down. Across nonfarm sectors, services employment increased whereas industrial employment recorded a slight fall. The PMI and BTS survey indicators that reflect actual and expected employment figures for firms were down in February 2015. Other indicators for the labor market point to no significant recovery in employment as of the first quarter of 2015.
Monetary Policy and Risks
11. The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) stated that economic activity lost some momentum in the first quarter of the year. This slowdown was attributed to the weak external demand, the volatile financial markets and adverse weather conditions. As it is too early at this point to distinguish the negative impact of weather conditions, the Committee suggested monitoring the data closely for a while before making a more definitive assessment regarding the underlying trend of economic activity.
12. The ongoing cautious monetary policy along with prudent fiscal and macroprudential policies are having a favorable impact on inflation, especially inflation excluding energy and food (core inflation indicators). The moderate course of aggregate demand conditions and the continued downtrend in import prices support disinflation as of the first quarter. In the short run, the annual rate of increase in core indicators is likely to decline further thanks to base effects. However, elevated food prices and the recent exchange rate movements will cause inflation to hover above the level indicated in the January Inflation Report for some time.
13. Global markets continue to follow a volatile course. The reduced predictability regarding global economy, the low inflation rates across advanced economies, and the growing uncertainty along with the decoupling of monetary policies cause global markets to remain highly data-sensitive. As a result, the risk appetite and capital flows continue to be volatile. The Committee pointed out that the measures the CBRT has recently taken in terms of foreign exchange liquidity and prudent borrowing are to minimize macro financial risks arising from the uncertainty in global financial markets and global economic activity.
14. In sum, the uncertainty in global markets and elevated food prices necessitates maintaining the cautious stance in monetary policy. Accordingly, the Committee decided to keep the interest rates at current levels.
15. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the improvements in the inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be monitored closely and the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook.
16. Developments on the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes on administered prices. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently, have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
17. The Committee assessed that the implementation of the announced structural reforms would contribute significantly to potential growth over the medium to long term. Any measure that would strengthen stability and confidence, ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline, and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates at low levels."

Governor Erdem Başçı delivered a presentation at the Banks Association of Turkey.
Erdem Başçı, Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, made a presentation at the meeting held by the Banks Association of Turkey on Monday, April 6th, 2015.
Governor Başçı emphasized the following points:

The ongoing cautious monetary policy along with prudent fiscal and macroprudential policies are having a favorable impact on inflation, especially inflation excluding energy and food.
Uncertainty in global markets and elevated food prices necessitate maintaining the cautious stance in monetary policy.
Measures to be proposed by the Food Committee will make an additional contribution to disinflation in food prices.
The developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. Although external demand remains weak, domestic demand contribute moderately to growth.
The continuation of maturity extension in the external borrowing of our banks will be beneficial for stable growth.

2015,6 April 2015,THE CBRT HAS UPDATED THE REAL EFFECTIVE EXCHANGE RATE INDICES,"No:2015-24
6 April 2015
THE CBRT HAS UPDATED THE REAL EFFECTIVE EXCHANGE RATE INDICES
The country weights used in the calculation of the Real Effective Exchange Rate indices (2003=100), which have been published monthly since July 2010, are based on “2006-2008” foreign trade data. However, the increase in the volume of foreign trade and the diversification of our trading partners have necessitated a new study. For this reason, the Real Effective Exchange Rate indices published by the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) on its website (www.tcmb.gov.tr) under the Statistics / Exchange Rates / Real Effective Exchange Rate directory and available as time series in the EDDS database have been updated.
Accordingly;
•   In contrast to the old indices using 2006-2008 period trade flows for the entire series, the new indices have been calculated based on three-year trade flow averages (the 2003-2005 period, the 2006-2008 period and the 2009-2011 period) in compliance with the methodologies of international organizations.

DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Meeting Date: April 22, 2015
Participating Committee Members
Erdem Başçı (Governor), Ahmet Faruk Aysan, Murat Çetinkaya, Turalay Kenç, Necati Şahin, Abdullah Yavaş, Mehmet Yörükoğlu. 
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 10.75 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 10.25 percent, and borrowing rate at 7.25 percent,
b) One-week repo rate at 7.5 percent,
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.25 percent.
Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. External demand remains weak, while domestic demand contributes to growth moderately. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the announced structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly.
The ongoing cautious monetary policy along with prudent fiscal and macroprudential policies are having a favorable impact on inflation, especially inflation excluding energy and food (core inflation indicators). Yet, uncertainty in global markets and elevated food prices necessitates maintaining the cautious stance in monetary policy. Accordingly, the Committee decided to keep the interest rates at current levels. Moreover, it is assessed that a measured cut in the FX deposit lending rates and a measured hike in the partial remuneration rate on Turkish lira required reserves will support financial stability.
Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the improvements in the inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be monitored closely and the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

30 April 2015
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 22 April 2015     
Inflation Developments  
1. In March, consumer prices increased by 1.19 percent and annual inflation rose by 0.06 points to 7.61 percent. Inflation in food and related services maintained its high course, while the decline in the annual consumer inflation excluding food and catering services continued. Underlying trends of core inflation indicators registered some increase in this period.
2. Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 0.42 points to 14.12 percent. This was led by unprocessed food prices, and ongoing price hikes particularly in vegetables-fruits and meat stood out. On the other hand, annual inflation receded in processed food prices. Unfavorable influence of food prices to inflation continued with an increasing trend in this period and contribution of food group reached 3.47 points in annual inflation. On the other hand, energy prices rose by 1.60 percent in March, yet the group’s annual inflation remained low with 0.19 percent.
3. Prices of services were up by 0.56 percent in March, while annual services inflation fell by 0.1 points to 8.53 percent. Annual inflation slowed in groups other than rents and restaurants-hotels. Due to the increased cost pressures driven by food prices, the divergence between the annual inflation rates of catering prices and other services groups continued. The rise in the underlying trend of services inflation in February continued in this period.
4. Annual inflation of core goods decreased by 1.25 points to 5.54 percent in March. Annual inflation was down across all main categories, particularly in durable goods, largely due to the base effect. In the first quarter, pass-through of the exchange rate developments to core goods inflation under attenuated demand conditions proved limited. Meanwhile, the underlying trend of core goods inflation exhibited some deterioration.
5. To sum up, the ongoing cautious monetary policy along with prudent fiscal and macroprudential policies continue to have a favorable impact on inflation, especially inflation excluding energy and food (core inflation indicators). Despite the slowdown in domestic demand, the high course of food prices and the exchange rate developments are the key risk factors regarding the inflation outlook in the upcoming period.  
Factors Affecting Inflation
6. According to data released by TURKSTAT, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 2.6 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2014. Thus, annual growth ended 2014 at 2.9 percent. On the production side, the value-added from all sectors except construction posted year-on-year increases in the final quarter. Yet, over 2014, the agricultural value-added contributed negatively to annual growth due to drought-driven production losses, whereas value-added of construction, industry and services sectors expanded. On the spending front, the private demand for consumption and machinery-equipment investment added to growth in the fourth quarter, while the public sector made a weaker contribution. Net exports made a negative contribution to growth in this period as imports increased at a faster pace than exports. Over 2014, Europe’s sluggish growth and geopolitical tensions across neighboring countries dampened exports. However, imports nearly flattened on the back of the slowing rate of increase in domestic demand, making net exports the demand component that provided the highest contribution to growth in 2014. 
7. Data released for the first quarter of 2015 point to a relatively weak outlook for economic activity. Although industrial production recorded a monthly increase of 1.7 percent in February, the level of production remained unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2014 during January-February period. This outlook is mostly attributed to the slowdown in domestic demand growth and the weak external demand as well as to the setbacks in the supply chain and construction activities caused by adverse weather conditions in January and February. PMI and Business Tendency Survey (BTS) data suggest that this weak course will continue in March.
8. Data on the expenditure side show that the production of consumer goods was lower than the previous quarter’s average, while the imports of consumer goods were on the rise. In this period, domestic sales of home appliances dropped. Yet, sales of automobiles were up in the first quarter. Consumer confidence continued to weaken amid uncertainty over global markets. Among indicators for investments, the production and imports of machinery-equipment went down from the previous quarter’s average. Among variables related to construction investments, the production and imports of minerals declined. The investment tendency failed to demonstrate a steady recovery in the first quarter of 2015, thus remaining weak. Against this background, private domestic demand is expected to slow down slightly and contribute moderately to growth in the first quarter of 2015.
9. External demand indicators show that the rebalancing process based on goods excluding gold, which came to a halt in the second half of 2014, has not shown an improvement as of January-February. This outlook is largely driven by the weak growth across Turkey’s trading partners and the slowing yet ongoing domestic demand growth. In fact, during this period non-gold exports were down, while non-gold imports increased from their averages in the previous quarter. Nevertheless, the favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans continue to contribute to the improvement in the current account balance.
10. In January 2015, both total and nonfarm unemployment rates decreased on the back of rising nonfarm employment. Across nonfarm sectors, services employment continued to grow whereas construction employment maintained the negative pattern that started in December. On the other hand, after falling in previous months, industrial employment regained momentum, providing a major contribution to the fall in unemployment.
11. To summarize, first-quarter data have yet to signal a recovery in economic activity. In this period, external demand weakened, but domestic demand is expected to contribute moderately to growth. However, the uncertainty over global markets and the weak course of consumer and investor confidence increase the downside risks to growth for the upcoming period. Thus, demand conditions are expected to support disinflation.
Monetary Policy and Risks
12. Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The composition of loans also continues to evolve in the desired direction. Commercial loans grow at a faster pace than consumer loans. This loan outlook not only limits medium-term inflationary pressures but also contributes to the improvement in the current account balance.
13. The weak external demand caused by the sluggish growth across European countries, the largest export market for Turkey, and geopolitical developments in neighboring countries continues to limit the growth of exports. In addition to the weak external demand, the recent plunge in the value of the euro against the US dollar may have an adverse impact on firms that export in euro, but Turkey’s share in the European market remains robust. The recent signs of recovery for the European economy might be a development that would boost the external demand.
14. The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) stated that economic activity lost some momentum in the first quarter. This slowdown was largely due to the weak external demand, volatility in financial markets and adverse weather conditions. Although economic activity is expected to grow gradually and moderately from the second quarter onwards, downside risks remain important. Lingering volatility in global financial markets and the weak course of confidence indices are the risk factors that may limit the contribution of the private sector final demand to growth. In case of an additional slowdown in external demand and a sizeable decline in global growth rates, the decrease in commodity prices will pull inflation down but at the same time lead to notable adverse effects on domestic economic activity. Under such circumstances, the Committee will employ the policy tools to support the economy.
15. The Committee evaluated the medium-term forecasts to be published in the April Inflation Report. The first quarter’s higher-than-projected annual consumer inflation compared to the January Inflation Report is mostly attributed to soaring food prices. Moreover, oil prices and TL-denominated import prices put cost pressures on inflation. Analyzing the assumptions and external conditions that underlie the inflation forecasts, the end-2015 inflation forecast is revised upwards in view of oil prices, TL-denominated import prices and output gap developments.
16. The ongoing cautious monetary policy along with prudent fiscal and macroprudential policies are having a favorable impact on inflation, especially inflation excluding energy and food (core inflation indicators). Low levels of international commodity prices and the moderate course of aggregate demand conditions support disinflation. The Committee expects the annual inflation of core indicators to decline further in the short run, with also contribution of base effects. However, the recent exchange rate movements may have an adverse impact on the core inflation outlook.
17. Food prices remain as the main risk factor for the inflation forecast. Although food inflation is expected to remain high in the short term according to the baseline scenario, food prices are likely to see a notable correction upon the introduction of new-season products in the summer months. Moreover, measures that may be proposed by the Food Committee are assessed to contribute to the decline in the food inflation in the upcoming period. However, prices of some food items are sensitive to the exchange rate and there are uncertainties over supply-side developments, which necessitate caution against food inflation.
18. Global markets continue to follow a volatile course. Reduced predictability of global economy and increased uncertainties amid the divergence among the monetary policies of advanced economies cause global markets to remain highly data-sensitive. Against this background, the volatility in the risk appetite and capital flows continues. The Committee emphasized that measures recently taken in the FX liquidity, intermediation costs and prudential borrowing aimed at reducing macrofinancial risks stemming from uncertainties regarding global financial markets and the course of economic activity. Macro financial risks will be closely monitored in the upcoming period and additional measures will be taken when deemed necessary.
19. In sum, the uncertainty in global markets and elevated food prices necessitate maintaining the cautious stance in monetary policy. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the pace of improvements in the inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be monitored closely and the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook.
20. Developments on the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes on administered prices. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently, have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
21. The Committee assessed that the implementation of the announced structural reforms would contribute significantly to potential growth. Any measure that would ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels."

27 May 2015
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 20 May 2015    
Inflation Developments  
1. In April, consumer prices increased by 1.63 percent and annual inflation rose by 0.30 points to 7.91 percent. This rise in annual inflation stemmed from the energy group, and particularly fuel prices. Inflation in food and related services maintained the high course, while the annual consumer inflation excluding food and catering services posted a slight increase, yet remained low. Annual core inflation indicators edged down again, whereas underlying trends thereof registered some increase in this period.
2. Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 0.24 points to 14.36 percent in April. This was mainly led by unprocessed food prices, the annual inflation of which hit 18.88 percent. Among the unprocessed items, fresh vegetables-fruits and meat stood out with an ongoing adverse outlook. On the other hand, annual inflation receded in processed food prices while monthly price increases were high in sub-items excluding bread. The contribution of food prices to annual inflation continued to rise and reached 3.51 points in April. Energy prices rose by 0.43 percent in April amid rising fuel and water prices, and the group’s annual inflation reached 1.62 percent mainly due to the base effect.
3. Prices of services rose by 0.74 percent in April, and the annual services inflation edged up by 0.2 points to 8.74 percent. Cost pressures driven by food prices continued, while the effects of the recent volatility in exchange rates have been observed in the sensitive groups. The underlying trend of services has remained flat compared to the last month and stayed high.
4. Annual inflation of core goods decreased by 0.48 points to 5.06 percent in April. Annual inflation was down across all main categories, particularly clothing. Lagged effects of exchange rate developments proved apparent in monthly price developments. Accordingly, the underlying trend of core goods inflation recorded some increase.
5. To sum up, the ongoing cautious monetary policy stance along with domestic demand conditions continue to have a favorable impact on core inflation, whereas the recently-elevated volatility in exchange rates has limited the improvement in core inflation. Moreover, volatility in energy and food prices affects the consumer inflation adversely.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6. In March, seasonally and calendar-day adjusted industrial production grew by 2.2 percent month-on-month, recording a robust increase for the second month in a row. Thus, industrial production grew by 1.2 percent quarter-on-quarter and 1.3 percent year-on-year in the first quarter. Production developments have varied across industries. The weak external demand affected the textiles industry negatively while weather conditions dampened the other minerals industry, which is sensitive to construction activity. These developments drove the industrial production down by 0.4 points in the first quarter. However, the industries of vehicles, other transport vehicles, pharmaceuticals, and oil products added a total of 1.6 points to the quarterly growth.
7. Although industrial production increases solidly, survey indicators present a weaker outlook. The PMI production data have been hovering below 50 since the beginning of the year. The equilibrium value of the Business Tendency Survey (BTS) question about production over the last three months has been declining gradually since October 2014. Survey indicators for domestic and external demand confirm the weak course of exports and do not produce strong signals about domestic demand. Thus, PMI data on new orders and new export orders have remained below 50 since January. Orders over the last three months and three-month-ahead order expectations from BTS have been weakening in both exports and the domestic market. In sum, while industrial production grew robustly in the first quarter, in line with the weak production-related survey indicators since early 2015 it is assessed that the underlying trend in production remains moderate and economic recovery may exhibit a gradual path.
8. Data on the expenditure side point to an increase in private demand for the first quarter. In this period, the production and imports of consumer goods posted a quarterly growth, particularly faster for imports. After the January contraction, sales of home appliances were up month-on-month in February and March, signaling a positive outlook for private consumer demand. Meanwhile, the rapid increase in automobile sales that contributed significantly to the recent consumption growth continued into April. Among indicators for investment goods, the production and imports of machinery‐equipment recorded a quarterly and yearly decline in the first quarter. Yet, the robust sales of light and heavy commercial vehicles hint at an improvement in investments. Hence, it is assessed that private demand continues to recover.
9. Data on production and sales offer a positive outlook for private demand, yet confidence indices point to downside risks. The consumer confidence has been weak for a long time. The BTS data on investment tendency and overall economic activity and TURKSTAT’s confidence indices for retail trade, services, and construction sectors also show that expectations of firms have yet to begin improving. The lingering volatility in financial markets restrains the improvement of financial conditions. All these developments suggest that the recovery in private demand will be moderate and gradual.
10. In the first quarter of 2015, non‐gold exports were down while non-gold imports were up from their past quarterly averages. This outlook is largely driven by exports that have been weaker than domestic demand due to the slowing growth across trading partners. Nevertheless, the favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance.
11. In February 2015, total and nonfarm unemployment rates decreased by about 0.1 point. Compared with January, both labor and employment growth slowed across nonfarm sectors. Construction employment declined, whereas industrial employment remained flat. Having accelerated from previous periods, the employment growth in services was the major driver of nonfarm employment growth. The recently released industrial production and survey data show that employment might recover somewhat in the second quarter. Yet, the current path of economic activity and the weakening investment tendency pose downside risks to employment.
12. To summarize, external demand remains weak, while domestic demand contributes to growth moderately. The uncertainty over global markets and the weak course of consumer and investor confidence suggest that economic activity will remain moderate in the upcoming period. Based on this outlook, the aggregate demand conditions support disinflation.
Monetary Policy and Risks
13. Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The composition of loans also continues to evolve in the desired direction. Commercial loans grow at a faster pace than consumer loans. This loan outlook not only limits medium‐term inflationary pressures but also contributes to the improvement in the current account balance. Moreover, the favorable developments in the terms of trade continue to support the improvement in the current account balance.
14. Industrial production gained some momentum in the first quarter partly owing to the thriving vehicle production. Consumer confidence and investment tendency point to a moderate private domestic demand, while leading indicators suggest that external demand is relatively weak. Recent signs of recovery in Europe might be a development that would boost the external demand. However, lingering volatility in global financial markets and the weak course of confidence indices are the risk factors that may limit the contribution of the private final demand to growth. To sum up, external demand remains weak while domestic demand contributes to growth moderately. Thus, the recovery in economic activity is expected to be gradual and aggregate demand conditions are expected to continue supporting disinflation.
15. The ongoing cautious monetary policy along with prudent fiscal and macroprudential policies continue to have a favorable impact on inflation, especially inflation excluding energy and food (core inflation indicators). However, recently elevated volatility in the exchange rates has limited the improvement in the core inflation, as stated in the April Inflation Report. The moderate course of aggregate demand conditions and low levels of international commodity prices support disinflation but the recent fluctuations in energy prices curtail this contribution. Food prices, which are still at high levels, remain as the main risk factor for inflation. However, with the introduction of new seasonal products in summer months, food prices are likely to see a notable correction.
16. Global markets continue to follow a volatile course. Reduced predictability of global economy and increased uncertainties amid the divergence among the monetary policies of advanced economies cause global markets to remain highly data‐sensitive. Against this background, the volatility in the risk appetite and capital flows continues. The Committee assessed that the measures taken to support the FX liquidity, core liabilities and long-term borrowing enhanced the resilience of the economy against global shocks. Additional measures along these lines may continue to be taken if deemed necessary.
17. In conclusion, the global market uncertainty and the unfavorable effects of the exchange rate volatility on core inflation coupled with the volatility in energy and food prices make it necessary to maintain the cautious stance in monetary policy. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the improvements in the inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be monitored closely and the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook.
18. Developments on the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes on administered prices. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently, have an adverse effect on the medium‐term inflation outlook.
19. The implementation of the announced structural reforms is expected to contribute significantly to potential growth. Any measure that would ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long‐term government securities at low levels."

13 June 2015
PRESS RELEASE ON THE MAXIMUM INTEREST RATES FOR CREDIT CARDS IN Q3 2015
The monthly maximum interest rates that banks can charge on credit card borrowing in the third quarter of 2015 have been left unchanged.
The CBRT sets maximum interest rates for credit card borrowing under legal authority expressed most recently in the CBRT Communiqué No. 2014/5 on Maximum Interest Rates to be Applied to Credit Card Transactions published in the Official Gazette No: 29153 dated 22 October 2014. Accordingly, to be effective from 1 July 2015, for the credit card borrowings, the monthly maximum contractual interest rate will be 2.02 percent for the Turkish lira and 1.62 percent for foreign exchange transactions, whereas the monthly maximum overdue interest rate will be 2.52 percent for the Turkish lira and 2.12 percent for foreign exchange transactions.
Banks are not allowed to charge higher interest rates than the rates announced by the CBRT for credit cards. Banks are free to determine their respective rates at their own discretion provided that they are below these ceilings. The maximum contractual and overdue interest rates for credit card transactions for the three-month period starting on 1 October 2015 will be announced by the CBRT prior to that date.
Banks in Turkey, as is the case in other countries, charge higher interest rates for credit card borrowing than they do for consumer loans. The CBRT therefore advises credit card holders with short-term credit needs to seek a consumer loan rather than borrowing on personal credit cards.

DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Participating Committee Members
Erdem Başçı (Governor), Ahmet Faruk Aysan, Murat Çetinkaya, Turalay Kenç, Necati Şahin,  Abdullah Yavaş, Mehmet Yörükoğlu. 
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels:
a)    Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 10.75 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 10.25 percent, and borrowing rate at 7.25 percent,
b)    One-week repo rate at 7.5 percent,
c)    Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.25 percent.
Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. External demand remains weak, while domestic demand contributes to growth moderately. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the announced structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly.
Inflation is expected to decline in the short term owing to a partial correction in food prices. Yet, recent movements in the exchange rates have delayed the improvement in the core indicators. This, combined with the uncertainty in global markets and volatility in energy and food prices, makes it necessary to maintain the cautious stance in monetary policy. The Committee has therefore decided to keep the interest rates at current levels.
Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the improvements in the inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be monitored closely and the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

2015,30 June 2015,SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING,"No:2015-43
30 June 2015
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 23 June 2015      
Inflation Developments
1.    In May, consumer prices increased by 0.56 percent and annual inflation edged up by 0.2 points to 8.09 percent. Annual food inflation in this period declined owing to the correction in unprocessed food prices. On the other hand, energy prices maintained the upward trend amid the developments in crude oil prices. Being affected by the exchange rate developments, core goods inflation followed an upward course, while services inflation remained high. Accordingly, the underlying trend of core inflation indicators registered an increase due to core goods.
2.    Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages fell by 1.55 points to 12.81 percent in May. This fall was mainly driven by unprocessed food prices, and partly by the slowdown in bread and cereal products prices. Seasonally-adjusted unprocessed food prices registered a decline due to fresh fruits and vegetables. Early indicators reveal that, amid the increase in product supply, correction in food prices will be more prononunced in June.
3.    Energy prices rose by 1.18 percent in May, and the group’s annual inflation recorded an uptick by 1.8 points and reached 3.38 percent mainly due to the low base. Domestic energy prices have been following an upward track since February. This rise is led both by the depreciation in the Turkish lira and the recovery in the international oil prices that hit the bottom in January.
4.    Prices of services rose by 0.77 percent, and the annual services inflation increased slightly to 8.85 percent in May. This was led by the price developments in restaurants-hotels and transport services, while annual inflation in other sub-groups remained relatively flat. Cumulative increases in food prices and the ongoing uptrend in meat prices pushed the inflation in restaurants-hotels group further upwards. Annual inflation in transport services have been receding since almost six months in line with the outlook in international fuel prices. However, upon the reversal of the downtrend in fuel prices, transport became another service item that recorded an increase in this period. Against this background, although remaining flat compared in May to the last month, the underlying trend of services stayed high.
5.    Annual inflation in core goods rose by 0.83 points to 5.88 percent in May. Among sub-groups, annual inflation in durable consumption goods rose by around 2 points to 4.66 percent in this period. Being led by the recent depreciation of the Turkish lira also against the euro, monthly price increases in durable consumption goods spread across all sub-groups, particularly home appliances and automobiles groups. Annual inflation was up in clothing, but declined in goods excluding clothing and durable goods. All in all, the seasonally-adjusted underlying trend of core goods inflation posted a significant increase mostly due to exchange rate pressures.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6.    According to TURKSTAT’s data, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded by 2.3 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2015. On the production side, the first quarter saw a yearly growth in the value added from non-construction industries. On the spending side, final domestic demand has increased due to private and public consumption demand. In this period, the ongoing yet slowing increase in domestic demand drove imports higher while net exports continued to make a negative contribution to annual growth amid declining exports caused by weak external demand.
7.    After the solid growth in February and March, industrial production remained unchanged month-on-month in April. On a quarterly basis, April’s production level is 2.1 percent above the quarter-ago average. Survey indicators suggest that there has recently been a slight recovery in the export orders. Meanwhile, domestic demand is expected to remain on a moderate upward trend. However, the May strikes, particularly those in the automotive industry, will cause output to drop across vehicle and base metal industries in this period. In fact, contrary to survey indicators, May survey data point to a plunge in non-gold exports driven by automotive industry exports. Thus, industrial production is expected to record a monthly fall in May. 
8.    Data on the expenditure side suggest that private demand continues to rise in the second quarter, albeit more slowly. The production and imports of consumer goods grew faster in April than in the first quarter. Sales of home appliances and automobiles were up in the April-May period from their first-quarter average. Meanwhile, business survey indicators and consumer confidence indices point to a moderate domestic demand for the April-May period. Production and imports data related to non-vehicle investments remained flat in April. Likewise, indicators for the construction industry and companies’ expectations for future investments have yet to signal some recovery in investment spending. In sum, indicators on the second-quarter suggest that economic activity grows modestly, driven by private consumer demand. 
9.    The terms of trade continues to affect the current account balance positively, which however is restrained by the sluggish exports. Leading indicators point to some increase in the seasonally-adjusted current account deficit in May. The improvement in the current account balance is expected to resume starting from June with the moderate course of consumer loans and lower energy prices. 
10.    In March 2015, unemployment rates were down 0.1 point from the previous period in seasonally-adjusted terms. Amid non-farm employment losses, unemployment rates declined on falling non-farm labor force. In this period, construction employment increased whereas industrial and services employment fell. The drop in services employment mostly reflects a correction of the strong growth in previous months. Since the last quarter of 2014, non-farm employment growth has been driven by the services sector, while the increase in industrial and construction employment have been small. The industrial production tendency and survey indicators suggest that employment might see some recovery in the second quarter. Yet, other leading indicators have been signaling that non-farm employment gains are very limited, thus tempering any expectations of a significant decline in unemployment. The current pace of economic activity and the weakening investment tendency pose downside risks to employment. 
Monetary Policy and Risks
11.    Loans continue to expand at a reasonable pace in response to the tight monetary stance and the macroprudential measures. The recent tightening in the overall financial conditions is expected to further slow down loan growth slightly in the second half of the year. The composition of loans continues to evolve in the desired direction, with commercial loans growing at a faster pace than consumer loans. In addition, consumer loans excluding home loans grow at a more modest pace. This loan outlook not only limits medium-term inflationary pressures but also contributes to the improvement in the current account balance. 
12.    External demand remains weak while domestic demand contributes to growth moderately. The current course of global demand dampens the improvement in the current account balance. The economic recovery in Europe affects external demand positively but the ongoing geopolitical tensions and the slowing global trade will cause exports to remain weak for some time. The decline in cumulative energy imports is expected to have a further favorable impact on the current account balance, if the current levels of oil prices are maintained. Overall, the favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance, while the relatively weaker exports limit this improvement. 
13.    The Committee stated that the inflation outlook has yet to display the desired improvement. Although a partial correction in food prices is expected to ease inflation in the short term, the recent exchange rate movements have delayed the improvement in core inflation. This, combined with the uncertainty in global markets and volatility in energy and food prices, makes it necessary to maintain the cautious stance in monetary policy. The Committee has therefore decided to keep the interest rates at current levels.
14.    Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the improvements in the inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be monitored closely and the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook.
15.    Global markets still pose significant risks. The reduced predictability of global economy and the increased uncertainties amid the divergence among the monetary policies of advanced economies cause global markets to remain highly data‐sensitive. Against this background, the volatility in the risk appetite and capital flows continues.
16.    The Committee underlined that, besides cyclical policies to stabilize capital flows, structural measures to enhance the resilience of the financial system are important as well. Accordingly, the Committee assessed that the measures implemented to support the FX liquidity, core liabilities, and long-term borrowing have enhanced the resilience of the economy against global shocks. Additional measures along these lines may be adopted if deemed necessary.
17.    Developments on the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes on administered prices. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently, have an adverse effect on the medium‐term inflation outlook.
18.    Sustained fiscal discipline has become a fundamental element in reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years. In the current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the value added from maintaining and further advancing these achievements is significant. Any measure that would ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long‐term government securities at low levels."

30 July 2015
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 23 July 2015
Inflation Developments

1.    In June, consumer prices decreased by 0.51 percent, bringing annual consumer inflation down by about 0.9 points to 7.20 percent. With the ongoing correction in food prices, the decline in annual food inflation became more pronounced. Changes in crude oil prices drove energy inflation lower, yet the depreciation of Turkish lira constrained the disinflation. Core goods inflation was slightly up due to exchange rate effects while services inflation remained elevated. Thus, both the annual inflation and the underlying trend of core inflation indicators followed a flat course.  

2.    Annual inflation in food and nonalcoholic beverages was down by 3.54 points in June to 9.28 percent. This decline was largely caused by unprocessed food prices, while annual processed food inflation continued to slow. May’s fresh fruit and vegetable-driven drop in seasonally-adjusted unprocessed food prices continued into this period at a stronger pace thanks to increased supply. However, red meat prices remained on the rise, affecting inflation negatively in associated categories such as processed food and catering services. 

3.    After an upsurge since February, energy prices decreased by 0.17 percent in June, bringing annual energy inflation down by 0.6 points to 2.78 percent. The fall in energy prices was mostly attributed to bottled gas and fuel prices, while indicators for July point to a continued decrease in energy prices. 

4.    Prices of services were up 0.88 percent in June while annual services inflation remained unchanged at 8.85 percent, mostly due to restaurants-hotels and other services. Annual inflation in rents and transport, on the other hand, decreased. Despite the significant correction in food prices over the past two months, annual restaurants-hotels inflation remained on the rise amid the ongoing upsurge in red meat prices. Meanwhile, annual inflation in the subgroup of other services increased due to rising prices of package holidays. As a result, underlying trend of services inflation remained flat at an elevated level. 

5.    Annual core goods inflation increased by 0.09 points to 5.97 percent in June. Annual inflation was up in durable goods due to base effects but down in other main categories. The substantial April-May price hikes were replaced by a slowdown in June across categories where exchange rate pass-through to prices is relatively faster, such as home appliances and automobiles. Prices of automobiles increased only modestly, while prices of furniture and electric/nonelectric appliances went down. On the other hand, core goods excluding clothing and durable goods continued to reflect the effects of cumulative depreciation in the Turkish lira. Hence, underlying trend of core goods inflation registered a small increase in June. 

Factors Affecting Inflation

6.    Industrial production declined by 2 percent in May on a monthly basis. This fall stemmed mainly from the production loss led by strikes in the automotive sector. The lowering effect on industrial production of the contraction in the production of vehicles is expected to be compensated for in the coming months. On a quarterly basis, the production level in the April-May period is 1 percent higher than the average production in the previous quarter. Assessing the PMI and BTS data together, a strong rebound is not expected in industrial production in the second quarter.

7.    Data on the expenditure side suggest that production and imports of consumption goods increased in the April-May period compared to the average of the previous quarter. Domestic sales of home appliances recorded an uptick in this period. Likewise, sales of automobiles in the second quarter stood above the first-quarter average. Consumer confidence, on the other hand, continued to weaken due to geopolitical risks and uncertainties in global markets. Among investment indicators, production and imports of machinery-equipment posted a decline in the April-May period in comparison to the average of the previous quarter. Production and imports of mineral products, among the indicators for construction investment, registered an increase in the same period. Construction employment remained flat in April. Investment tendency maintained its sluggish course in the second quarter of 2015. Accordingly, domestic private demand is expected to contribute to growth moderately in the second quarter.

8.    Following the contraction in the first quarter, the export quantity index excluding gold increased at a modest rate in the April-May period compared to the previous quarter, while the import quantity index excluding gold maintained its upward trend. This suggests that the contribution of external demand to growth may be limited in the second quarter. The weak course of the global economy and the ongoing geopolitical developments put a cap on export growth. On the other hand, the favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans continue to contribute to the improvement in the current account balance.

9.    In April 2015, total and non-farm unemployment rates fell by 0.1 and 0.2 points, respectively. Employment in non-farm sectors rose while the increase in labor force was limited, leading to a decline in the unemployment rate. Employment in the industrial and services sectors rose, while construction employment fell in this period. Since the last quarter of 2014, non-farm employment growth has been driven by the services sector, while the industrial and construction employment have fluctuated around a flat trend. The industrial production and survey indicators suggest that the contribution of industrial sector to employment will be limited also in the upcoming period. Services employment is anticipated to grow at a slower pace in the upcoming period owing also to the stagnant tourism sector. Accordingly, unemployment is not expected to record a notable decline in the rest of the year. The current course of economic activity and the weakening investment tendency pose downside risks to employment. 

10.    In sum, data on the second quarter of 2015 suggest a mild course in economic activity. External demand remains weak while domestic demand contributes to growth moderately. Meanwhile, geopolitical risks and uncertainties in global markets besides the weak course of consumer and investor confidence pose some risks to growth in the upcoming period.

Monetary Policy and Risks

11.    The Committee assessed the medium-term projections to be presented in the July Inflation Report. Inflation in the second quarter proved close to the forecasts of the April Inflation Report, while core inflation stood above the projections. In this period, the fall in food inflation became the main driver of the improvement in inflation, while core inflation rose mostly because of the exchange rate effects. Analyzing the assumptions and external conditions that underlie the inflation forecasts, the end-2015 inflation forecast is revised slightly upwards in view of the developments in import and food prices besides the rise in core inflation driven by the exchange rate. The Committee assesses that that the partial recovery in food prices accompanied by the cautious monetary policy will limit the deterioration in the inflation outlook and inflation will reach the target in the medium term. 

12.    Unprocessed food inflation had been quite unfavorable in the first quarter, leading inflation to post high figures. However, recently there has been a notable correction in food prices, which has affected inflation favorably. Similarly, the recent decline in oil prices supports disinflation. On the other hand, exchange rate movements have been especially influential in the core goods group, delaying the recovery in the core inflation trend. This delay, combined with the uncertainty in global markets and volatility in energy and food prices, makes it necessary to maintain the cautious stance in monetary policy. The Committee has therefore decided to keep the interest rates at current levels. 

13.    Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the pace of improvements in the inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, pricing behaviors and other factors affecting inflation will be monitored closely and the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained by keeping the yield curve flat, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook.  Besides the cautious monetary stance, additional foreign exchange liquidity measures may be adopted, if exchange rate movements continue to delay the fall in inflation.    
14.    Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. Commercial loans have recently been following a robust course of growth, while consumer loans lost pace due to the items excluding housing. Additionally, commercial loans grow faster than consumer loans in line with the desired loan composition. Owing also to the recent partial tightening in financial conditions, total credit growth is expected to slow somewhat in the second half of the year. This loan outlook not only limits medium-term inflationary pressures, but also contributes to the improvement in the current account balance.

15.    External demand remains weak while domestic demand contributes to growth moderately. Although the recovery in the European economy affects the external demand positively, ongoing geopolitical developments and the slowdown in global trade restrict the export growth. Meanwhile, cumulative energy imports will continue to decline if the current low levels of oil prices are maintained. As a result, favorable developments in the terms of trade and the mild course of consumer loans support the recovery in the current account balance, yet the relatively weak export outlook limits this recovery. Domestic demand, on the other hand, exhibits a mild increase driven mainly by consumption. Meanwhile, the weak course of confidence indices coupled with domestic and external uncertainties are the risk factors that may restrict the contribution of the final private demand to growth. In this context, it is projected that the recovery in economic activity will be gradual, and the aggregate demand conditions will continue to support disinflation.

16.    Risks to global markets remain significant. Reduced predictability of the global economy and increased uncertainties amid the divergence among the monetary policies of advanced economies cause global markets to remain highly data-sensitive. Against this background, the volatility in the risk appetite and capital flows continues. The Committee underlined that, besides cyclical policies to stabilize capital flows, structural measures to enhance the resilience of the financial system are important as well. Accordingly, recent measures implemented to support the FX liquidity, core liabilities, and long-term borrowing have enhanced the resilience of the economy against global shocks. The Committee has stated that additional measures along these lines may be adopted if deemed necessary.

17.    Following the global crisis, especially during the exit process of the US monetary policy, long-term rates in emerging economies have grown excessively sensitive to global monetary policies. The wide interest rate corridor and the tight liquidity policy implemented by the CBRT increased the resilience of our economy against global shocks during this period. In the upcoming period, following the start of normalization of global monetary policies, volatility in long-term interest rates may decline permanently thanks to forward guidance policies. According to this baseline scenario, the need for a wide interest rate corridor in our country may diminish over time.  In that case, the operational framework of the CBRT’s interest rate policy may be simplified gradually. Members of the Committee asked the technical departments to complete the preparations in this direction and to present them in August meeting.

18.    Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes on administered prices. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.

19.    Sustained fiscal discipline has become a fundamental element in reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years. In the current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the value added from maintaining and further advancing these achievements is significant. Any measure that would ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long‐term government securities at low levels."

Processed food and energy price developments affect inflation favorably in the short run, while exchange rate movements delay the improvement in the core indicators. Considering this delay and taking into account the uncertainty in domestic and global markets and the volatility in energy and food prices, the Committee decided to implement a tighter liquidity policy as long as deemed necessary. Moreover, the Committee also discussed the roadmap to be implemented before and after global monetary policy normalization and decided to publish a strategy document with today’s policy statement.     
Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the improvements in the inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be monitored closely and the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

2015,25 August 2015,SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING,"No:2015-50
25 August 2015
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 18 August 2015     
Inflation Developments
1. In July, consumer prices increased by 0.09 percent while annual inflation was down 0.39 points to 6.81 percent. Annual food inflation was flat month-on-month whereas falling oil prices brought annual energy inflation down. Services inflation declined while core goods inflation rose slightly due to exchange rate pass-through. The underlying trend of core inflation displayed a slight improvement.
2. Annual inflation in food and nonalcoholic beverages remained flat at 9.25 percent in July. Annual inflation was slightly up in unprocessed food but continued to slow in processed food. On the unprocessed food front, prices of fresh fruits and vegetables remained favorable, whereas meat prices continued to rise. Among processed food items, prices of bread and cereals continued to affect inflation favorably whereas prices of other items slightly accelerated.
3. Annual energy inflation decreased to 1.58 percent amid falling fuel prices driven by lower oil prices. With the ongoing plunge in oil prices in July, annual energy inflation is expected to slow further in August.
4. Prices of services were up 0.80 percent in July while annual services inflation dropped by 0.43 points to 8.42 percent. Amid higher meat prices, prices of catering services continued to soar in July. Annual inflation increased in rents and restaurants-hotels but fell in communication and transport items due to base effects. Overall, the underlying trend of services inflation posted a month-on-month improvement.
5. Annual core goods inflation increased by 0.09 points to 6.05 percent in July. Annual inflation was up in durable goods, down in clothing and flat in core goods excluding clothing and durables. Prices of durable goods reflected the pass-through effect from exchange rate movements. Thanks to the favorable course in clothing prices, the underlying trend of core goods inflation registered a fall.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6. The industrial production index increased strongly by 2.4 percent month-on-month in June. Accordingly, industrial production grew by 1.6 percent quarter-on-quarter and 3.9 percent year-on-year in the second quarter of 2015. The strong production growth in June does not signify an acceleration in economic activity and is rather a result of compensating for the output loss led by the May strikes in the auto industry and expediting production before Ramadan. In fact, leading indicators for July and August suggest that the industrial production might moderate in the second half of the year.
7. Data on the expenditure side indicate that private consumption demand expanded further in the second quarter while investments remained weak. Production and imports of consumption goods were higher in the second quarter compared to their averages in the previous quarter. Meanwhile, production and imports of capital goods excluding vehicles fell in the second quarter. Indicators for the construction industry do not hint at a recovery for construction activity. After declining dramatically in May amid strikes, domestic sales of automobiles registered month-on-month gains in June and July. Thus, having contributed substantially to consumption lately, sales of automobiles are believed to have supported consumption further in July. On the other hand, the PMI for the July-August period and the Business Tendency Survey order indicators for July do not signal a solid domestic demand. Likewise, consumer confidence indices remained weak in July. Firms’ expectations for future investments increased slightly in July but remained sluggish. In sum, current indicators point to a moderate outlook for consumption demand yet signal no recovery for investments.
8. After the first-quarter decline, the non-gold quantity index, an indicator for external demand, posted a quarter-on-quarter increase in the second quarter. Non-gold imports, on the other hand, grew modestly in the second quarter. As a consequence, deterioration in the real rebalancing process since mid-2014 somewhat reversed in the second quarter of 2015. Amid lower energy prices, the current account balance is expected to improve further in the upcoming period. However, the relatively weak outlook of exports and the likely fall in tourism revenues may dampen this improvement.
9. In May, seasonally adjusted total and nonfarm unemployment rates climbed by 0.2 and 0.3 points month-on-month, respectively. Although employment continued to expand in nonfarm sectors, unemployment increased due to the rising labor force participation, which was flat for some time. Industrial and services employment grew in this period, whereas construction employment declined. Industrial employment expanded at a stronger pace than in previous periods, providing the biggest contribution to nonfarm employment growth. Industrial production and survey indicators suggest that the industrial sector will contribute mildly to employment in the forthcoming period. The support from services was more limited due to the sluggish tourism industry. The contribution from the services industry to employment is expected to remain below early 2015 levels in the upcoming period. Thus, prospects for a robust employment growth are slim for the remainder of the year. The economic outlook and the waning investment tendency pose a downside risk to the labor market. 
10. To sum up, in the second quarter, external demand remained weak while domestic demand contributed to growth moderately. Current indicators suggest a similar outlook for the July-August period. Yet, uncertainties in global markets and the weak course of consumer and investor confidence add to the downside risks to growth for the upcoming period. 
Monetary Policy and Risks
11. Loan growth continues to expand at a reasonable pace in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. Commercial loan growth remains robust while consumer loans continues to decelerate. Recent tightening in financial conditions is likely to have some slowing impact on loan growth in the upcoming period. Overall, the pace and the composition of loans limit medium-term inflationary pressures and contribute to the improvement in the current account balance.
12. Recent data releases signal no significant change in the macroeconomic outlook. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. External demand remains weak, while domestic demand contributes to growth moderately. Although the recovery in the European economy affects the external demand positively, ongoing geopolitical developments and the slowdown in global trade restrict the export growth. Domestic demand, on the other hand, exhibits a modest upward trend driven mainly by consumption.
13. Although available data point to an ongoing moderate growth for economic activity, recent developments necessitate close monitoring of forward-looking signals. Recently, rising risk premiums due to global and domestic uncertainty have led to a tightening in financial conditions. This, coupled with the already weak confidence indices, creates downside risks regarding the domestic demand for the second half of the year.
14. Committee members stated that the inflation outlook has not displayed the desirable improvement yet. Although processed food and energy price developments affect inflation favorably in the short run, the cumulative exchange rate movements since early 2015 delay the recovery in the core inflation trend. Against this backdrop, the Committee stated that a slightly tighter monetary policy stance might be necessary to counterbalance the upside risks to inflation.
15. The Committee indicated that the inflation outlook and the risks would be instrumental for the exact implementation of the monetary tightening. Due to the imminent economic slowdown, exchange rate pass-through to domestic prices will be more limited than implied by historical estimations. Moreover, falling commodity prices partly offset the exchange rate effect. Meanwhile, downside risks to global economy and domestic economic activity remain significant. Accordingly, the Committee agreed to adopt a flexible approach for the implementation of the monetary tightening at this point and follow the consequences closely to review the situation at the next meeting. In conclusion, given the uncertainty over domestic and global markets and the volatility in energy and food prices, the Committee decided to implement a tighter liquidity policy for as long as deemed necessary.
16. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the improvements in the inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be monitored closely and the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook.
17. The Committee also evaluated the strategy to be pursued before and after the global monetary policy normalization, and decided to implement policy measures in three dimensions: (i) interest rate and Turkish lira liquidity, (ii) FX liquidity, and (iii) policies regarding financial stability. It was concluded that, considering the current global and domestic circumstances, the policies need to be tight for the Turkish lira, stabilizing for the FX liquidity, and supportive for financial stability. The Committee decided to publish the related document on the website.
18. A significant of the meeting focused on the simplification of the monetary policy framework. The Committee suggested that monetary policy framework may be simplified by gradually narrowing the interest rate corridor during global monetary policy normalization. It was stated that, eventually one week repo rate will assume the role of policy rate and represent the stance of monetary policy.
19. The Committee underlined that structural measures to support financial stability are as important as the cyclical policies to stabilize capital flows. Accordingly, the published roadmap included measures to support the FX liquidity and to provide incentives for core liabilities and long-term borrowing. The Committee stated that the past measures on this front have already enhanced the resilience of the economy and that additional measures may further bolster these gains.
20. Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes on administered prices. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
21. Sustained fiscal discipline has become a fundamental element in reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years. In the current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the value added from maintaining and further advancing these achievements is significant. Any measure that would ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long‐term government securities at low levels."

29 August 2015
Press Release on the Maximum Interest Rates for Credit Cards in Q4 2015
The monthly maximum interest rates that banks can charge on credit card borrowing in the fourth quarter of 2015 have been left unchanged.
The CBRT sets maximum interest rates for credit card borrowing under legal authority expressed most recently in the CBRT Communiqué No. 2014/5 on Maximum Interest Rates to be Applied to Credit Card Transactions published in the Official Gazette No: 29153 dated 22 October 2014. Accordingly, to be effective from 1 October 2015, for the credit card borrowings, the monthly maximum contractual interest rate will be 2.02 percent for the Turkish lira and 1.62 percent for foreign exchange transactions, whereas the monthly maximum overdue interest rate will be 2.52 percent for the Turkish lira and 2.12 percent for foreign exchange transactions.
Banks are not allowed to charge higher interest rates than the rates announced by the CBRT for credit cards. Banks are free to determine their respective rates at their own discretion provided that they are below these ceilings. The maximum contractual and overdue interest rates for credit card transactions for the three-month period starting on 1 January 2016 will be announced by the CBRT prior to that date.
Banks in Turkey, as is the case in other countries, charge higher interest rates for credit card borrowing than they do for consumer loans. The CBRT therefore advises credit card holders with short-term credit needs to seek a consumer loan rather than borrowing on personal credit cards.

DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Participating Committee Members
Erdem Başçı (Governor), Ahmet Faruk Aysan, Murat Çetinkaya, Turalay Kenç, Necati Şahin, Abdullah Yavaş, Mehmet Yörükoğlu. 
 
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 10.75 percent, and borrowing rate at 7.25 percent,
b) One-week repo rate at 7.5 percent,
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.25 percent.
Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. External demand remained weak in the first half of the year, while domestic demand contributed to growth moderately. The composition of growth is expected to shift gradually towards net exports in upcoming periods with the support of rising demand from the European Union economies. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the announced structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly.
Energy price developments affect inflation favorably, while exchange rate movements delay the improvement in the core indicators. Considering the impact of the uncertainty in domestic and global markets on inflation expectations and taking into account the volatility in energy and food prices, the Committee decided to maintain the tight liquidity stance as long as deemed necessary. Moreover, the Committee assessed the measures already implemented and to be implemented in the context of the “road map during the normalization of global monetary policies”.
Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the improvements in the inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be monitored closely and the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.

2015,1 October 2015,SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING,"No:2015-59
1 October 2015
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING 
Meeting Date: 22 September 2015  
Inflation Developments
1.    In August, consumer prices increased by 0.40 percent, and annual inflation edged up by 0.33 points to 7.14 percent. In this period, consumer prices were affected by the lagged impact of the depreciation in the Turkish lira. Annual food inflation increased, whereas falling oil prices continued to pull energy inflation down. Annual inflation in core goods and services edged up, leading to an increase in core inflation indicators. Seasonally adjusted data indicate that the underlying recent trend of inflation slowed down, yet remained at high levels.
2.    Following the flat course in July, annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 0.46 points to 9.71 percent in August. Soaring fruit prices was the main driver of the increase in food inflation. Moreover, meat prices continued to increase, contributing to the upside movement in the unprocessed food inflation. On the processed food front, the downward trend in annual inflation continued, but monthly price increase remained still high at 0.83 percent. Leading indicators on September inflation point that annual unprocessed food inflation may post another increase with rising fresh fruits and vegetables prices. Meanwhile, energy prices went down by 0.76 percent in August and continued to affect inflation favorably. With the ongoing decline in crude oil prices, annual energy inflation receded to 1.26 percent.
3.    Prices of services rose by 1.14 percent in August, and annual services inflation crept up by 0.24 points to 8.65 percent. In this period annual inflation increased across all main subcategories except transport, reflecting the effects of the depreciation in the Turkish lira. Ongoing cost pressures driven by food inflation pushed prices in the restaurants-hotels group up by 2.05 percent, leading this group to hit the highest monthly inflation of the last nine years. On the other hand, amid the low course of crude oil prices, annual inflation in transport services remained at modest levels. Overall, underlying trend of services inflation edged up in August.
4.    Annual core goods inflation rose by 0.52 points to 6.58 percent in August. Cumulative depreciation in the Turkish lira has adversely affected prices in the core goods group, especially the durable goods. Durable goods annual inflation increased to 7.04 percent, led by the rising of prices electrical and non-electrical appliances. Indicators on September point that exchange rate pass-through will continue to affect the prices of durable consumption goods.
5.    In sum, the Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) assessed that developments in energy prices continue to affect inflation favorably, yet exchange rate movements delay the improvement in the core inflation trend.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6.    According to TurkStat, GDP grew by an annual 3.8 percent in the second quarter of 2015. Final domestic demand increased on the back of both private and public sectors, with private demand registering a stronger growth. Private consumption and private investments, respectively, contributed the most to the second quarter’s annual growth. The imports expanded with the continued rise in domestic demand while the weak foreign demand brought exports down, causing net exports to contribute negatively to annual growth.
7.    In July, industrial production decreased by 1.5 percent month-on-month in seasonally adjusted terms, falling below the second-quarter average by 0.9 percent. This production drop is largely attributed to the correction of June’s sharp increase and the reduced number of working days due to factors such as bridge days. Leading indicators for August signal a mild rise in production.
8.    Data on the expenditure side indicate that domestic demand may be more moderate in the second half than in the first half. In July, the production of consumption goods posted a monthly decline whereas the imports of consumption goods grew on the back of automobiles demand. The strong uptrend in the sales of automobiles slowed somewhat during July-August period. Sales of home appliances were slightly down during July-August compared to the second quarter. Consumer confidence indices continue to weaken as of August. Indicators for the construction industry do not reveal a robust recovery in construction activity, while firms’ expectations for future investments hint at no significant improvement. 
9.    Due to the first half’s weaker exports and rising consumption demand, the current account balance ceased to improve. Data for August and September point to a slowing import demand while export orders seem to have recovered slightly. The growth composition is expected to shift gradually towards net exports over the upcoming period thanks to a rising demand from EU members. Amid this composition change and lower oil prices, the improvement in the current account balance is expected to be more significant in the forthcoming period. 
10.    In June, nonfarm employment remained flat while labor force participation continued to rise. Thus, unemployment rates registered an increase. Services employment remained on the rise whereas industrial and construction employment decreased marginally. Industrial production and survey indicators suggest that industrial employment may fail to contribute to nonfarm employment growth in the third quarter after the modest first-half increase. Taken with the other leading indicators, no major gains are expected for employment in the upcoming period. The economic outlook and the weak investment tendency pose a downside risk to employment. 
11.    To sum up, current indicators suggest that domestic demand growth is likely to be more moderate in the forthcoming period than in the first half of the year. Uncertainties in global markets and the weak course of confidence indices add to the downside risks to the growth outlook and employment. Thus, demand conditions are likely to support disinflation. 
Monetary Policy and Risks
12.    Annual loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The Committee highlighted that loan growth has displayed a notable deceleration due to tighter financial conditions recently. Specifically, FX commercial loans and consumer loans have lost significant momentum in recent weeks, which, as evaluated by the Committee, is mostly demand-driven. 
13.    External demand remained weak in the first half of the year, while domestic demand contributed to growth moderately. The weak consumer confidence and the recent sales data point to a slowdown in consumption demand for the second half of the year. The recent increase in relative prices of investment and durable goods will curb the demand in these sectors. Accordingly, imports are expected to slow in the upcoming period. On the exports front, despite the negative impact of geopolitical developments, the rising demand from EU members is likely to affect Turkey’s exports positively. Against this background, the Committee expects the growth composition to shift gradually towards net exports in the upcoming period, which will have a favorable impact on the current account balance. Moreover, the developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. Accordingly, the current account balance is expected to display a significant improvement starting with the August figures. 
14.    Energy price developments continue to affect inflation favorably. The upward impact of the exchange rate developments on inflation is partly offset by lower oil prices. Yet, the accumulated pass-through from exchange rate developments delay the recovery in the core inflation trend. Leading indicators signal that the exchange rate pass-through to domestic prices continue to exert upside pressures on inflation. Considering these developments and the recent increase in inflation expectations, the Committee stated that the overall pricing behavior should be monitored closely. 
15.    Food prices remain volatile. Even though unprocessed food prices are expected to post a downward correction in the final quarter, the course of food prices as of September poses an upside risk to the year-end food inflation forecast. In addition, the ongoing volatility across global markets necessitates a cautious monetary stance. Overall, considering the impact of the uncertainty in domestic and global markets on inflation expectations and taking into account the volatility in energy and food prices, the Committee decided to maintain the tight liquidity stance as long as deemed necessary.
16.    Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the improvements in the inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be monitored closely and the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook.
17.    The Committee also assessed the measures already implemented and to be implemented in the context of the “road map during the normalization of global monetary policies”. The measures announced within the road map has largely been put into effect over the last one month. Accordingly, further measures were taken to support the FX liquidity, core liabilities and long-term borrowing. Moreover, the operational framework of the liquidity policy was simplified. In this respect, the overnight borrowing facility provided for primary dealers via repo transactions was terminated and collateral conditions were simplified. According to the Committee, the arrangements regarding the use of FX deposits as collateral for TL operations will increase the efficiency of the banks’ liquidity management practices. It was underlined that all these steps will continue to boost the resilience of the economy against global shocks. The Committee reiterated that the Central Bank’s current monetary policy stance can be summarized as tight against the inflation outlook, stabilizing for FX liquidity, and supportive for financial stability.
18.    Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
19.    Sustained fiscal discipline has become a fundamental element in reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years. In the current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the value added from maintaining and further advancing these achievements is significant. Any measure that would ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long‐term government securities at low levels."

DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Participating Committee Members
Erdem Başçı (Governor), Ahmet Faruk Aysan, Murat Çetinkaya, Turalay Kenç, Necati Şahin, Abdullah Yavaş, Mehmet Yörükoğlu. 
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels:
a)    Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 10.75 percent, and borrowing rate at 7.25 percent,
b)    One-week repo rate at 7.5 percent,
c)    Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.25 percent.
Annual loan growth continues at reasonable rates in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. External demand remained weak in the first half of the year, while domestic demand contributed to growth moderately. The composition of growth is expected to shift gradually towards net exports in upcoming periods with the support of rising demand from the European Union economies. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the announced structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly.
Energy price developments affect inflation favorably, while exchange rate movements delay the improvement in the core indicators. Considering the impact of the uncertainty in domestic and global markets on inflation expectations and taking into account the volatility in energy and food prices, the Committee decided to maintain the tight liquidity stance as long as deemed necessary.
Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.
The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

28 November 2015
Press Release on the Maximum Interest Rates for Credit Cards in Q1 2016
The monthly maximum interest rates that banks can charge on credit card borrowing in the first quarter of 2016 have been left unchanged.
The CBRT sets maximum interest rates for credit card borrowing under legal authority expressed most recently in the CBRT Communiqué No. 2014/5 on Maximum Interest Rates to be Applied to Credit Card Transactions published in the Official Gazette No: 29153 dated 22 October 2014. Accordingly, to be effective from 1 January 2016, for the credit card borrowings, the monthly maximum contractual interest rate will be 2.02 percent for the Turkish lira and 1.62 percent for foreign exchange transactions, whereas the monthly maximum overdue interest rate will be 2.52 percent for the Turkish lira and 2.12 percent for foreign exchange transactions.
Banks are not allowed to charge higher interest rates than the rates announced by the CBRT for credit cards. Banks are free to determine their respective rates at their own discretion provided that they are below these ceilings. The maximum contractual and overdue interest rates for credit card transactions for the three-month period starting on 1 April 2016 will be announced by the CBRT prior to that date.
Banks in Turkey, as is the case in other countries, charge higher interest rates for credit card borrowing than they do for consumer loans. The CBRT therefore advises credit card holders with short-term credit needs to seek a consumer loan rather than borrowing on personal credit cards.

1 December 2015
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 24 November 2015     
Inflation Developments
1- In October, consumer prices increased by 1.55 percent, and annual inflation edged down by 0.37 points to 7.58 percent. Annual food inflation declined on account of the unprocessed food prices, while the annual energy inflation decreased due to the base effect. Meanwhile, the depreciation in the Turkish lira pushed annual inflation in core goods upwards. Annual services inflation, on the other hand, maintained its high levels. Accordingly, annual inflation of core indicators and their seasonally adjusted underlying trend registered increases.
2- Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages declined by around 2 points to 8.69 percent in October. This decline was led by annual unprocessed food inflation that receded to 9.40 percent driven particularly by the prices of vegetables. On the processed food front, the downward trend in annual inflation continued. Leading indicators of November show that annual food inflation may increase due to the unprocessed food prices. Energy prices went up by 0.77 percent while the annual energy inflation decreased by around 1.8 points to 0.12 percent due to base effect in October.
3- Prices of services rose by 0.71 percent in October, and annual services inflation edged up by 0.11 points to 8.65 percent. Annual inflation decreased in the restaurants-hotels group, remained flat in rent and increased in other services. Meanwhile, prices of catering services maintained the upward trend and the annual inflation in this group, with 14.87 percent, remained as the determinant of the high course of prices of services. Against this background, the underlying trend of services inflation exhibited an almost flat course in October maintaining its high level.
4- Annual core goods inflation rose by 1.25 points to 9.19 percent in October. The cumulative depreciation in the Turkish lira pushed the prices of core goods by 1.75 percent on a monthly basis. Witnessing the exchange rate effects with a longer lag, the annual inflation in core goods excluding clothing and durables reached 8.49 percent. Moreover, the clothing group recorded the highest October price increase of the index history. Accordingly, seasonally-adjusted data showed a sustained increase in the underlying trend of core goods inflation.
5- In sum, the Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) assessed that developments in energy prices continue to affect inflation favorably, yet cumulative effects of the exchange rate movements delay the improvement in the core inflation trend.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6- After the sharp monthly increase in August, industrial production remained flat in September, thus recording a quarterly growth of 1.1 percent in the third quarter. Due to fewer working days in September, industrial production declined by a yearly 7.9 percent, yet it might pick up again year-on-year thanks to October’s increased working days. The BTS data on production over the last three months and the PMI indicators point to a moderate monthly growth for October. Industrial production has become increasingly volatile due to bridge days and the changing number of working days. Yet, seasonally and calendar adjusted three-month averages suggest that production remains on the rise.
7- Data on the expenditure side suggest a more moderate demand outlook in the third quarter relative to the first half of the year. The production and imports of consumption goods declined in the third quarter. The retail sales volume index slowed quarter-on-quarter, while non-food retail sales posted a quarterly contraction in the third quarter. After a robust second-quarter, imports of investment goods were down in the third quarter on a quarterly basis. Data on construction employment and the production and imports of minerals indicate a stable pattern in construction investments. All in all, domestic demand is likely to provide a modest contribution to growth in the third quarter.
8- The non-gold exports volume index rose in the third quarter whereas the imports index fell in line with moderate domestic demand. Therefore, the growth composition appears to be shifting in favor of net exports thanks to the rising demand from the EU countries. This composition change and the favorable developments in the terms of trade along with the moderate course of consumer loans support the improvement in the current account balance. Recent data indicate a marked improvement in the seasonally adjusted current account balance. Thus, the current account balance in annual terms is expected to improve further.
9- Among BTS indicators, export orders over the last three months have seen expectations grow increasingly optimistic since early third quarter, while domestic orders have recovered recently after the weak course of the first three quarters. Moreover, the consumer confidence increased notably amid lessening domestic uncertainty. Likewise, expectations for investment and employment continued to improve. Against this background, confidence and revenue channels are expected to boost domestic demand in the upcoming period.
10- Non-farm unemployment remained flat in August due to the falling labor force participation, while non-farm employment decreased. By sectors, employment picked up slightly in services and construction but declined in the industrial sector for the third period in a row. Thus, the average annual non-farm employment growth equaled 3 percent in the January-August period. Having trended upward for the first three quarters, industrial production is expected to remain on the rise through the rest of the year. Survey indicators for industrial employment also point to a recovery in September and October. Accordingly, the fall in industrial employment is likely to be temporary. Given the economic outlook, the modest growth in services and construction employment is expected to continue.
11- To sum up, domestic demand appears to follow a more moderate course in the second half of the year, while external demand makes an increased contribution to growth. The recovery in European economy affects external demand positively, whereas geopolitical tensions pose a downside risk to external demand. Meanwhile, the reduced domestic uncertainty drives consumer confidence and expectations of investment and employment higher, which are expected to help to support the recovery of domestic demand over the upcoming period. Hence, aggregate demand conditions are likely to provide further support for disinflation.
Monetary Policy and Risks
12- Annual loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. Yet, loan growth has seen some deceleration recently. Specifically, commercial loans denominated in foreign currency and consumer loans have lost significant momentum. The Committee expects loans to return to the moderate growth path amid normalized financial conditions over the upcoming period. With respect to the composition of loans, commercial loans continue to grow faster than consumer loans. This composition not only limits medium-term inflationary pressures, but also helps to improve the current account balance.
13- Indicators for the second half of the year point to a moderate economic activity. Industrial production continued to grow in the third quarter as well after the first half of the year. In this period, the non-gold exports volume index increased whereas the imports index fell. The rising demand in the European economy affects Turkey’s exports positively while geopolitical developments put downward pressure on external demand. Both the recent recovery of the confidence index and the improving expectations for investment and employment are likely to bolster domestic demand. Accordingly, the Committee assesses that the growth composition has shifted in favor of net exports. In addition to this shift, the favorable developments in the terms of trade and the sluggish course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. Given the recent notable improvement in the seasonally-adjusted current account balance, the annual current account deficit is expected to narrow further.
14- Energy price developments continue to affect inflation favorably. The negative impact of cumulative exchange rate developments since the beginning of the year on the inflation outlook is partly offset by lower oil prices. Food prices, on the other hand, remain volatile mainly due to unprocessed food prices. The cumulative Turkish lira depreciation caused the annual core goods inflation to rise and the core inflation trend to deteriorate slightly. Thus, considering the impact of the global market uncertainty on inflation expectations and the volatility in energy and unprocessed food prices, the Committee stated that the tight liquidity stance will be maintained as long as deemed necessary. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and developments in other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained.
15- Uncertainties surrounding global monetary policies and concerns over global growth cause financial markets to remain volatile. Therefore, portfolio flows to emerging economies follow a volatile pattern. Despite having improved somewhat recently, risk premia and exchange rate volatilities remain high. The Committee stated that the measures announced by the CBRT within the context of the “road map during the normalization of global monetary policies” boost the resilience of the economy against global shocks. The current monetary policy stance continues to be tight against the inflation outlook, stabilizing for the FX liquidity, and supportive of financial stability.
16- In case the decline in loan growth rates becomes permanent and exchange rates continue to face upward pressure over the upcoming period, in addition to preserving the tight monetary policy stance, the Committee may take measures to support the Turkish lira and the loan growth by easing the conditions for the use of foreign currency denominated collateral.
17- Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
18- Sustained fiscal discipline has become a fundamental element in reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years. In the current environment of highly uncertain global markets, the value added from maintaining and further advancing these achievements is significant. Any measure that would ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long‐term government securities at low levels."

29 December 2015
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING 
Meeting Date: 22 December2015
Inflation Developments
1. In November, consumer prices increased by 0.67 percent, and annual inflation edged up by 0.52 points to 8.10 percent. Annual food inflation increased on account of the unprocessed food prices, while the annual energy inflation rose due to the base effect. Meanwhile, the effects of depreciation in the Turkish lira, albeit waning, pushed annual inflation in core goods further upwards. Annual services inflation maintained its high levels. Thus, annual inflation of core indicators recorded an increase, while the underlying trend of inflation implied by seasonally adjusted data remained flat.
2. Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 0.83 points to 9.51 percent in November. This was driven by annual unprocessed food inflation that climbed to 11.48 percent mostly due to rising prices of vegetables. On the processed food front, the downward trend in annual inflation continued. Energy prices edged down by 0.31 percent in tandem with the decline in fuel prices, while the annual energy inflation increased to 1.26 percent due to base effect in November. The annual energy inflation is projected to increase further in December on account of the base effect.
3. Prices of services increased by 0.17 percent, and annual services inflation rose by 0.16 points to 8.80 percent in November. Annual inflation slowed in the restaurants-hotels group, but edged up in other sub-groups. The seasonally-adjusted data indicated a slight slowdown in the underlying trend of services inflation in November.
4. Annual core goods inflation rose by 0.41 points to 9.61 percent in November. The cumulative depreciation in the Turkish lira continued to affect core inflation despite alleviating in certain items. Monthly price increases in durable goods decelerated in November following higher levels in the preceding two months. However, clothing prices remained on an increasing path. As a consequence, seasonally-adjusted data indicated an increase in the underlying trend of core goods inflation. Meanwhile, the annual inflation in core goods excluding clothing and durables reached 8.67 percent in November.
5. In sum, lagged effects of the exchange rate movements continued to delay the improvement in inflation, but the decline in oil prices contained this effect. Against this backdrop, core inflation remained on an upward trend in November.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6. According to data released by TURKSTAT, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 4.0 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2015. In seasonally-adjusted terms, national income maintained its robust growth, posting an increase by 1.3 percent quarter-on-quarter. On the expenditure side, net exports made a considerably high contribution to quarterly growth amid the rise in exports and decline in imports. Consumption spending continued to expand, while investment spending remained relatively weak in this quarter.
7. Owing to the base effect from number of working days, industrial production registered a notable year-on-year growth in October. In seasonally and calendar-adjusted terms, October production figure was flat compared to the previous month, but 1.0 percent higher than the third-quarter average. Among indicators of November, the manufacture of vehicles and electricity generation receded. The Business Tendency Survey data and the PMI indicators for the last three months point to an increase in production due to waning domestic uncertainties. Accordingly, industrial production is projected to rise on a quarterly basis in the last quarter of the year.
8. Data on the expenditure side suggest a more moderate demand growth in the last quarter. Following a slight decline in the third quarter, sales of automobiles remained below the previous quarter’s average in the October-November period. Sales of white goods also recorded a decline in the October-November period. Imports of investment goods receded on a monthly basis. Indicators of construction investment exhibit a mild pattern, while future investment expectations of firms point to a recovery in the October-November period. In sum, domestic demand is likely to provide a modest contribution to growth in the last quarter.
9. Recent rebound in confidence indicators ease the downside risks to economic activity. Business survey data indicate that export orders over the last three months recorded an improvement in the October-November period, while domestic orders, which remained moderate in the first three quarters, assumed a recovery trend recently. Moreover, the consumer confidence has increased notably. Likewise, investment and employment prospects improved in the October-November period. Against this background, confidence channel is expected to boost domestic demand in the upcoming period.
10. Current account balance continues to improve. Although geopolitical tensions still weigh on export growth, the robust increasing trend in exports to Europe provides support to growth and rebalancing. Current account balance is expected to further improve in the upcoming period, owing to the lagged effects of the fall in oil prices and the slowdown in credit growth.
11. In September 2015, non-farm unemployment rate recorded a limited decline upon the increase in employment. Labor force in non-farm sectors trended upwards in this period. Among sectors, industrial employment claimed the highest rate of increase in September following a decline of three quarters in a row. Employment in the construction sector edged up, while that in the services sector followed a robust course. Going ahead, industrial production and survey indicators signal a mild increase in employment. Given the economic outlook, the current trends in services and construction employment is expected to be maintained. Overall, non-farm unemployment may recede in the last quarter of the year.
12. To sum up, recent indicators suggest that domestic demand follows a more moderate course in the last quarter of the year, while external demand offers positive contribution to growth. Although geopolitical tensions pose a downside risk to external demand, the recovery in the European economies contributes to external demand. Meanwhile, the recovery in consumer confidence as well as investment and employment prospects amid waning domestic uncertainties is likely to support domestic demand in the upcoming period. Hence, economic activity is expected to maintain a stable growth trend.
Monetary Policy and Risks
13. Annual loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. Although loan growth has recently displayed a downward trend, the recovery in financial conditions and higher revenues due to wage hikes are expected to support loan growth in the upcoming period. Commercial loans continue to grow at a faster pace than consumer loans. Such a composition not only limits medium-term inflationary pressures but also supports the improvement in the current account balance.
14. In the third quarter of the year, growth composition turned in favor of net exports on a quarterly basis. Following a robust trend in the first half, domestic demand displayed a milder course in the second half of the year, as projected. Although the geopolitical tension resides as a downward risk to external demand, this risk is contained by the flexibility of our exports in shifting markets. In fact, Turkish exports towards the European Union countries recently gained considerable momentum. Moreover, favorable developments in the terms of trade and the deceleration in consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. Therefore, the annual current account deficit is expected to narrow further in the upcoming period.
15. The Committee stated that the desired improvement in the inflation outlook is yet to be seen. Although energy price developments continue to affect inflation favorably, cumulative exchange rate movements delay the improvement in the core inflation trend. Exchange rates followed a relatively stable course during the final quarter of the year amid easing domestic uncertainties and the significant improvement in the current account balance. However, the lagged pass-through from the cumulative depreciation in the first three quarters continued to have an adverse impact on inflation. Accordingly, core inflation indicators are expected to remain at high levels in the short run. In addition, year-end unprocessed food inflation is likely to exceed the October Inflation Report projections. The effect of higher-than-targeted inflation on expectations and the acceleration in wage increases necessitate close monitoring of the overall pricing behavior. Against this backdrop, the Committee stated that the tight liquidity stance would be maintained as long as deemed necessary.
16. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the factors affecting the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and developments in other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained.
17. The Committee stated that the wide interest rate corridor has contributed to containing exchange rate volatility in times of heightened global volatility. The need for such an instrument would be reduced, should the decline in volatility observed after the start of the global policy normalization prove persistent.
18. Another factor reducing the need for a wide interest rate corridor is the effective use of policy instruments laid out in the roadmap published in August. Excessive fluctuations both in exchange rates and loans have waned owing to the launch and effective use of these instruments.
19. In this respect, the Committee highlighted the significance of the measures to stabilize the foreign exchange liquidity during the simplification process. To this end, it was indicated that the automatic stabilizer feature of the ROM will be strengthened before the monetary policy simplification, as elaborated in the Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2016. Moreover, it was reiterated that conditions and limits regarding the pledge of foreign currency deposits as collateral against Turkish lira operations might be revised before and during simplification.
20. Against this background, monetary policy simplification steps would begin with the next meeting, should the decline in volatility prove persistent. The interest rate corridor is aimed to be narrower and more symmetrical around the one-week repo rate. The nature and the pace of simplification steps will depend on the factors affecting the volatility in global and domestic markets.
21. Developments in the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
22. Sustained fiscal discipline has become a fundamental element in reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy against external shocks in recent years. Given the current environment of highly uncertain global markets, maintaining and further advancing these achievements is significant. Any measure to ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long‐term government securities at low levels."

Participating Committee Members 
Erdem Başçı (Governor), Ahmet Faruk Aysan, Murat Çetinkaya, Turalay Kenç, Necati Şahin, Abdullah Yavaş, Mehmet Yörükoğlu. 
 
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels: 
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 7.75 percent, borrowing rate at 3.5 percent, and the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 6.75 percent, 
b) One-week repo rate at 4.5 percent, 
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, lending rate at 10.25 percent. 
Recent data suggest that final domestic demand and exports continued to grow at a moderate pace during the fourth quarter. The cautious monetary policy stance, the announced macroprudential measures, and weak capital flows lead to a gradual slowdown in loan growth. Accordingly, the decline in the current account deficit excluding gold trade is expected to continue in 2014. 
The Committee monitors the impact of the recent increase in the risk premium on the inflation outlook and expectations. Inflation is likely to hover above the 5 percent target for some time due to recent tax adjustments and lagged effects of exchange rate developments. The Committee stated that the liquidity stance should be tightened to align inflation outlook with the medium term targets. To this end, interbank money market interest rates will materialize at 9 percent during additional monetary tightening days, instead of 7.75 percent (the marginal funding rate). 
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING 
Meeting Date: 21 January 2014 
Inflation Developments
1. In December, consumer prices increased by 0.46 percent, while annual inflation rose to 7.40 percent. Energy prices were influential in this development and there was no significant change in the contribution of other main groups to the rise in annual inflation. In this period, core inflation indicators continued to follow a downward course as in November. 
2. Annual food group inflation receded to 9.67 percent. In December, annual unprocessed food group inflation remained flat at 12.88 percent, while items other than fresh fruits and vegetables saw widespread price hikes. Processed food prices increased by 0.73 percent due to the bread and cereals group, while the group’s annual inflation declined to 7.11 percent. Leading indicators for January suggest that annual food group inflation will remain elevated because of the impact of adverse weather conditions on fresh fruit and vegetable prices.
3. In December, energy prices rose by 2.35 percent mainly owing to sharp increases in LPG and bottled gas prices. Moreover, the recent depreciation of the Turkish lira caused gas and diesel prices to rise. As a result, annual energy inflation recorded the lowest year-end level of the last four years despite rising to 5.15 percent. 
4. In December, services prices increased by 0.39 percent, and the group’s annual inflation came in at 7.98 percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) judged that, despite the favorable course of energy inflation throughout the year, wage increases and the recovery in domestic demand were influential in the rise of services inflation. However, it is noted that recent seasonally adjusted data indicate a slowdown in the underlying trend of services inflation.
5. Meanwhile, annual core goods inflation fell to 6.20 percent in December due to the downward contribution of clothing prices and the waning effects of the Turkish lira depreciation. Seasonally adjusted data also showed that the underlying trend of the group’s inflation was on a downward path. However, the resumed depreciation of the Turkish lira as of mid-December and January’s tax adjustments for automobiles may deteriorate the outlook for core goods inflation. In fact, leading indicators have recently pointed to a significant increase in prices of durable goods, especially automobiles. 
6. In sum, given that core inflation indicators may show a marked increase in January, it is noted that inflation will remain significantly above the 5 percent target in the short term due to unfavorable food prices as well."

Participating Committee Members 
Erdem Başçı (Governor), Ahmet Faruk Aysan, Murat Çetinkaya, Turalay Kenç, Necati Şahin, Abdullah Yavaş, Mehmet Yörükoğlu. 
 
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to adjust the short term interest rates as follows: 
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate is increased from 7.75 percent to 12 percent, borrowing rate from 3.5 percent to 8 percent, and the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions from 6.75 to 11.5 percent. 
b) One-week repo rate is increased from 4.5 percent to 10 percent. 
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate is kept at 0 percent, lending rate is increased from 10.25 percent to 15 percent. 
Recent domestic and external developments are having an adverse impact on risk perceptions, leading to a significant depreciation in the Turkish lira and a pronounced increase in the risk premium. The Central Bank will implement necessary measures at its disposal to contain the negative impact of these developments on inflation and macroeconomic stability. In this respect, the Committee decided to implement a strong monetary tightening and to simplify the operational framework. Accordingly, (i) one-week repo rate is increased from 4.5 percent to 10 percent; (ii) the Central Bank liquidity will be provided primarily from one-week repo rate instead of the marginal funding rate in the forthcoming period. 
Tight monetary policy stance will be sustained until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. Under this policy stance, inflation is expected to reach the 5 percent target by mid-2015. 
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

Release Date: 30 January 2014
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 28 January 2014
Recent Developments
1. Recently, uncertainties in the domestic and foreign markets have increased substantially. As a consequence, Turkish lira depreciated significantly and risk indicators displayed a marked increase. Especially, since the last Monetary Policy Committee (Committee) meeting held on January 21st, heightened risk perceptions towards emerging economies have accelerated the depreciation of some emerging market currencies, leading to a deterioration in their inflation outlook. 
2. Exchange rate movements in Turkey driven by these developments have increased the risk of inflation hovering significantly above the target for an 
extended period. Besides rapid exchange rate depreciation, recent tax adjustments and adverse developments in food inflation were other factors 
contributing to the deterioration in the inflation outlook. 
Monetary Policy and Risks
3. The Central Bank will not tolerate any deterioration in the price stability. To this end, the Committee assessed that, in order to prevent a deterioration in the inflation expectation and the overall pricing behavior, it would be appropriate to deliver a strong and front-loaded monetary tightening. 
4. The Committee stated that tightening monetary policy under current circumstances will not only contribute to price stability, but also support the 
macroeconomic stability through a reduction in the exchange rate uncertainty and risk perceptions. Moreover, it was indicated that increasing the 
predictability of monetary policy would be helpful amid weakening capital inflows. 
5. Accordingly, in order to preserve price stability, the Committee decided to implement a strong monetary tightening and to simplify the operational 
framework. In this respect, (i) one-week repo rate is increased from 4.5 percent to 10 percent; (ii) the Central Bank liquidity will be provided primarily 
from one-week repo rate instead of the marginal funding rate in the forthcoming period. 
6. The Committee judges that, current policy stance will be enough to anchor inflation expectations. Under this stance, inflation is expected to reach the 5 percent target by mid-2015. Although January inflation may exceed the market expectations, tight policy stance should prevent any deterioration in medium term inflation expectations. In subsequent months, underlying inflation is expected to trend downside. The Committee indicated that tight monetary policy stance will be sustained until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. If deemed necessary, liquidity policy may be tightened further in order to invert the slope of the yield curve."

The Committee closely monitors recent deterioration in the inflation outlook and expectations. Inflation is likely to hover above the 5 percent target for some time due to recent tax adjustments, exchange rate developments, and elevated food prices. In order to contain the deterioration in inflation expectations and pricing behavior, the Committee implemented a strong and frontloaded monetary tightening at the interim meeting of January 28, 2014. Tight monetary policy stance will be maintained until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. 
There is a gradual slowdown in loan growth stemming from the tight monetary policy stance, the recent macroprudential measures, and weak capital flows. The data regarding the first quarter of 2014 indicate some deceleration in private final domestic demand. Meanwhile, with the help of the recovery in foreign demand, contribution of net exports to economic growth is expected to increase. Accordingly, the Committee expects a significant improvement in the current account deficit in 2014. 
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

Release Date: 25 February 2014
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING 
Meeting Date: 18 February 2014 
Inflation Developments 
1. In January, consumer prices increased by 1.98 percent, and annual inflation reached 7.75 percent. Food prices, tax adjustments and exchange rate movements were influential in this rise and core inflation indicators recorded an increase due to core goods. Meanwhile, services inflation maintained its relatively mild course. 
 
2. Annual food group inflation climbed to 10.89 percent. In January, not only fresh fruits and vegetables but also other products registered price hikes. This resulted in increased annual unprocessed food inflation despite the high base from the previous year. Meanwhile, upon price increases that spread across the group, processed food prices were up by 1.42 percent and the group’s annual inflation reached 8 percent. 
 
3. In January, despite the fall in international oil prices, energy prices increased owing to the rise in domestic fuel prices amid the depreciation of the Turkish lira. Meanwhile, in the alcoholic beverages and tobacco products group, SCT adjustments introduced pushed the tobacco products’ prices up by 7.4 percent.
 
4. Prices of services edged up by 0.93 percent, and the group’s annual inflation maintained its level around 8 percent. Seasonally adjusted data pointed to a limited rise in the underlying trend of services inflation in this period. Meanwhile, annual core goods inflation increased by about 1 percentage points to 7.12 percent. This was mainly driven by the surging prices of durable goods on the reverberations of the depreciation in the Turkish lira besides the raised SCT on automobiles. On the other hand, annual inflation in the clothing group remained on a downward trend. Core goods prices accelerated as the depreciation in the Turkish lira that started in mid-December has reflected on prices since January.
5. In sum, The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) closely monitors the recent deterioration in the inflation outlook and expectations. Inflation is likely to hover above the 5-percent target for some time due to the recent tax adjustments, exchange rate developments and the unfavorable course of food prices. 
 
Factors Affecting Inflation 
6. Recent data suggest that final domestic demand continued to increase moderately in the fourth quarter. Following the recent sharp fluctuations, the industrial production index remained steady at its November level in December. Yet, in quarterly terms, industrial production posted a modest 
quarter-on-quarter increase in the fourth quarter, which is close to the average growth rate seen since early 2012. 
7. The moderate trend in private consumption demand continued in the last quarter of the year. Production and imports of consumer goods were up 
quarter-on-quarter compared to the previous quarter. Despite hovering slightly below the averages of the previous quarter, sales of automobiles and white goods remained elevated throughout the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, investment demand was more favorable in the fourth quarter. Production of capital goods grew moderately quarter-on-quarter in the final quarter. The production of capital goods excluding vehicles, an indicator for the underlying trend, recorded a larger growth than total capital goods. Similarly, imports of capital goods increased as well. 
8. Data suggest that exports maintained their modest growth trend in the fourth quarter. In fact, the non-gold export volume index was up in the fourth quarter from the third-quarter average. The global recovery and the robust international import demand that PMI indicators point to have been effective in this increase. 
9. The increased domestic uncertainty has caused consumer confidence to slump recently. Meanwhile, automobile sales also slowed dramatically in January. Moreover, loans, particularly consumer loans, have been posting a gradually slower rate of growth. On the other hand, despite some weakening, the investment and employment sentiment in January’s Business Tendency Survey (BTS) maintained their moderate levels, while the PMI new order and production indices have no negative outlook. Against this background, the Committee envisages that private domestic final demand may decelerate in the first quarter of 2014.
10. Seasonally adjusted unemployment rates remained unchanged in November 2013. The rise in employment in this period came largely from the services sector, while construction employment increased after a flat performance throughout 2013 and industrial employment remained relatively weak. Leading indicators show no signs of additional worsening for employment and point to a moderate employment growth. In view of the expected slowdown in domestic demand, unemployment appears to be on a slightly upward trend for 2014. A smaller-than-expected global economic recovery and domestic uncertainties may remain constraint to investment and employment growth for the upcoming period. 
Monetary Policy and Risks
11. The Committee noted that credit growth has been slowing gradually due to tight monetary policy, macroprudential measures and weak capital flows. Particularly due to macroprudential measures, the growth of consumer loans is expected to slow at a relatively faster pace. Moreover, it is assessed that the recent uncertainty might cause private demand to weaken in the first quarter. Data released for the first quarter of 2014 suggest that private domestic final demand might decelerate. 
12. Recent data indicate that exports continue to grow moderately and the non-gold current account balance maintains its improvement trend. Thus, the Committee stated that the recovering external demand and the slowing private domestic final demand will help to increase the positive contribution from net exports to growth over the year. This increase may also contain the negative effects of the decelerating domestic final demand on growth. In addition, the slowdown in consumer loan growth could particularly support the current account rebalancing. Against this background, the Committee expects the current account balance to display a significant improvement in 2014. 
13. In the second half of 2013, with the high course of food prices and the external uncertainties that led the Turkish lira to depreciate, inflation increased and core inflation indicators and inflation expectations deteriorated. Recent and lingering external uncertainties coupled with the elevated domestic uncertainties caused additional exchange rate movements, which weighed on the risk of inflation exceeding the target for a protracted period. Moreover, the recent tax adjustments and the persisting unfavorable course of food prices also exacerbated the deterioration in the inflation outlook. 
14. The Committee closely monitors the recent deterioration in the inflation outlook and expectations. It is envisaged that factors affecting inflation adversely will keep inflation indicators considerably above the 5-percent target for a while. Against this background, the Committee underlined that it will not tolerate any deterioration in price stability in the medium-term. To this end, the Committee opted for a strong and front-loaded monetary tightening in the interim meeting of 28 January 2014 to prevent deterioration in the inflation expectation and the pricing behavior. The Committee judges that the current policy stance will be enough to anchor inflation expectations. The Committee indicated that tight monetary policy stance will be sustained until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook and that the liquidity policy may be tightened further if deemed necessary. 
15. The Committee monitors fiscal policy developments and tax adjustments closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance takes the fiscal framework outlined in the Medium Term Program as given. Accordingly, it is assumed that fiscal discipline will be sustained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices. A revision in the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal stance deviate significantly from this framework and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook. 
16. Maintaining the cautious stance in fiscal and financial sector policies is critical to the resilience of our economy against current uncertainties. Strengthening structural reforms that will ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability in the medium term. Steps taken in this regard will also provide more room for maneuvering the monetary policy and improve social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities permanently at low levels. In this respect, implementation of the structural reforms required by the Medium Term Program remains to be of utmost importance."

The Committee highlighted the upside risks on the inflation outlook and assessed that the strong and frontloaded monetary tightening delivered at the January interim meeting has contained the adverse impact of such risks on the medium term inflation expectations. Yet, inflation is expected to increase until June, partly reflecting base effects. Against this backdrop, inflation expectations and pricing behavior will be closely monitored and the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. 
Loan growth continues to slow down in response to the tight monetary policy stance, recent macroprudential measures, and weak capital flows. In line with these developments, the data regarding the first quarter of 2014 indicate some deceleration in private final domestic demand. Meanwhile, with the help of the recovery in foreign demand, the contribution of net exports to economic growth is expected to increase. The Committee expects that such a demand composition will support disinflation and lead to a significant improvement in the current account deficit in 2014. 
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

PRESS RELEASE ON THE MAXIMUM INTEREST RATES TO BE APPLIED TO CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS
The maximum interest rates to be applied to credit card transactions have not been changed.
The monthly maximum contractual and overdue interest rates to be applied to credit card transactions, which were set with the CBRT Communiqué No. 2013/11 on the Amendment to the Communiqué No: 2006/1 on Maximum Interest Rates To Be Applied To Credit Card Transactions published in the Official Gazette No: 28765 dated 14 September 2013 and which took effect as of 1 October 2013, are left unchanged. The rates will continue to be valid for the 3-month period starting on 1 April 2014.
Accordingly, the monthly maximum contractual interest rate to be applied to credit card transactions during the period between 1 April 2014 – 30 June 2014 is 2.02 percent for the Turkish lira, 1.70 percent for the US dollar and 1.64 percent for the Euro, whereas the monthly maximum overdue interest rate is 2.52 percent for the Turkish lira, 2.20 percent for the US dollar and 2.14 percent for the Euro.
As of 1 April 2014, the contractual and overdue interest rates to be applied by banks to credit card transactions will not exceed the above-mentioned maximum rates. Banks are free to determine their respective rates at their own discretion provided that they are below the ceiling rates. The maximum contractual and overdue interest rates, which will be valid for the 3-month period starting on 1 July 2014, will be announced by the CBRT prior to this date.
Banks in Turkey, as is the case with the banks in other countries, set the credit card interest rates higher than those on consumer loans. Therefore, the CBRT advises credit card holders to prefer consumer loans rather than personal credit cards to meet their short-term credit needs."

SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING 
Meeting Date: 18 March 2014 
Inflation Developments 
1. In February, consumer prices rose by 0.43 percent, and annual inflation increased by 0.14 percentage points to 7.89 percent. Core inflation indicators displayed an upsurge amid the depreciation in the Turkish lira. Inflation indicators are expected to remain high in the upcoming period due to the unfavorable course of the food prices and the lagged effects of the exchange rate pass-through. 
 
2. Annual food group inflation fell by 0.83 percentage points to 10.05 percent. In February, unprocessed food prices decreased due to vegetable prices. 
Nevertheless, the unfavorable outlook in unprocessed food prices excluding fresh fruits and vegetables continued, and the annual rate of price increases in this group stood at 24.21 percent. Processed food prices increased by 1.65 percent on a monthly basis amid the price increases that spread across the group, the largest increases being in the bread-cereals item. As a consequence, the group’s annual inflation climbed to 9.42 percent. Meanwhile, the rainfall rate has remained below the seasonal averages in various areas lately, leaving the upside risks to food prices brisk.
3. Prices of services edged up by 0.77 percent, and the group’s annual inflation increased by 0.38 percentage points to 8.34 percent in February. These figures indicated that the services inflation has hit the highest level since the first quarter of 2009. The seasonally adjusted data pointed to a persisting rise in the underlying trend of services inflation in this period as well. 
4. Annual core goods inflation increased by 1.28 percentage points to 8.39 percent in February. This was mainly driven by the rising prices of durable goods, particularly automobiles, reflecting the effects of the past depreciation in the Turkish lira. The seasonally-adjusted data pointed to a higher trend in the core goods inflation compared to January. Core inflation indicators registered a similar outlook as well.
5. Against this background, inflation is expected to remain on the rise in the upcoming months, partly reflecting base effects. 
Factors Affecting Inflation 
6. Industrial production increased remarkably in January compared to December. This increase owes to the recovery from December’s weak base as well as to rising export orders and improved export expectations driven by the relative pickup in external demand. Compared with the fourth-quarter average, January’s production levels are stronger. Yet, the economic activity is expected to moderate in coming months due to the repercussions of the weak domestic demand on economic activity. 
7. In recent months, global and domestic uncertainties and the resulting increase in risk premiums and exchange rates caused consumer confidence to plunge. In addition, the tightening in financial conditions has led to a slowdown in consumer loan growth rates. Available data indicate that sales of appliances and automobiles have been falling recently as well. Thus, the imports and production of durable consumer goods were significantly down in January compared to the previous month and quarter. 
8. After following a favorable trend in 2013, investment demand has lost some pace due to recent developments. Expectations for fixed capital investment fell to the lowest level since 2010, while the production of capital goods excluding vehicles, an indicator for the underlying trend of investments, dropped markedly month-on-month in January. Similarly, sales of commercial vehicles slowed down. 
9. Recent data show that exports continued to grow in the first quarter of 2014. The export volume index was up in January from both December and the fourth-quarter average. With the support of the global recovery, the robust international import demand, and the Turkish lira depreciation, exports are expected to make a positive contribution to growth in the upcoming period. 
10. In sum, recent data releases indicate that final domestic demand will lose momentum, whereas exports will limit the impact of this slowdown on growth. Against this background, the Committee expects the rebalancing to continue and the current account deficit to improve substantially in 2014.
 11. In seasonally adjusted terms, total and non-farm unemployment rates were down in December 2013 compared to the previous period. This drop in unemployment rates was mostly driven by the upsurge in non-farm employment. Employment basically increased across services and 
construction sectors. Industrial employment, on the other hand, increased only slightly and remained relatively weak. 
Monetary Policy and Risks 
12. The Committee assessed that upward risks on the inflation outlook remain important. Lagged impact of the exchange pass-through continues to exert upside pressures on core inflation, especially through core goods prices. Services inflation and other indicators regarding pricing behavior also suggest that underlying inflation rate is significantly above the target. The strong and frontloaded monetary tightening delivered at the January interim meeting has contained the potential adverse impact of the upside risks on the medium term inflation expectations. Yet, the impact of monetary tightening on inflation will be observed with some lag. In the meanwhile, inflation is expected to increase until June, partly reflecting the base effects. Against this backdrop, inflation expectations and pricing behavior will be closely monitored and the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. 
13. Loan growth continues to slow down in response to the tight monetary policy stance, recent macroprudential measures, and weak capital flows. The Committee indicated that the slowdown in loan growth can be mostly attributed to consumer loans and credit cards, noting that Turkish lira commercial loans continue to expand at a robust pace. The pronounced tightening in financial conditions observed in the first quarter suggests that the deceleration trend in loan growth will continue. The Committee members pointed that it will be useful to closely monitor the supply and demand factors driving loan market in the forthcoming period. 
14. In line with the developments in loan growth, data regarding the first quarter of 2014 indicate some deceleration in private final domestic demand. Meanwhile, with the help of the recovery in foreign demand, net exports are expected to contribute positively to economic growth. The Committee expects that such a demand composition will contain upside inflationary pressures and lead to a significant improvement in the current account deficit in 2014. 
15. The Committee stated that despite the moderate expansion in the economic activity, consumption and investment indicators show some relative weakening. The Committee members indicated that the weakening in demand indicators has not been significantly reflected in the economic activity at this point. However, as indicated in one of the risk scenarios of the Inflation Report, the risk of a marked slowdown in the economic activity through the confidence and balance sheet channels, caused by the possible persistence of existing uncertainties and elevated risk premiums, should not be overlooked. It was reminded that the Central Bank has many tools to implement countercyclical policy, should such a risk materialize. In this respect reserve requirements, reserve option mechanism and liquidity policies may be utilized, if needed. 
16. The Committee has also evaluated the possibility of paying interest to the portion of reserve requirements held in Turkish liras, in the context of the normalization of monetary policy. It was stated that, such a measure could be considered at a future date if deemed necessary. Moreover, implications of paying partial interest to reserve requirements were assessed in different dimensions, with regard to its interaction with the reserve option mechanism. In light of these assessments, it was indicated that any decision regarding the payment of partial interest to reserve requirements to be implemented in the future should be measured and limited.
17. The Committee monitors fiscal policy developments and tax adjustments closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be sustained and there will be no unanticipated hikes in administered prices. A revision in the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal stance deviate significantly from this framework and consequently have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook. 
18. Maintaining the cautious stance in fiscal and financial sector policies is critical to the resilience of our economy against current uncertainties. Strengthening structural reforms that will ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability in the medium term. Steps taken in this regard will also provide more room for maneuvering the monetary policy and improve social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels. In this respect, implementation of the structural reforms required by the Medium Term Program remains to be of utmost importance."

DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE 
Meeting Date: April 24, 2014 
 
Participating Committee Members 
Erdem Başçı (Governor), Ahmet Faruk Aysan, Murat Çetinkaya, Turalay Kenç, Necati Şahin, Abdullah Yavaş, Mehmet Yörükoğlu. 
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows: 
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been kept at 12 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been kept at 11.5 percent, and borrowing rate has been kept at 8 percent. 
b) One-week repo rate has been kept at 10 percent. 
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, while lending rate has been reduced from 15 percent to 13.5 percent.
The Committee assessed that the strong and frontloaded monetary tightening delivered at the January interim meeting has contained the adverse impact of upside risks on the medium term inflation expectations. Inflation expectations and pricing behavior will be closely monitored and the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. 
Recent decline in uncertainties and partial improvement in the risk premium indicators have reduced the need for an additional tightening in liquidity policy. Accordingly, the Committee decided to deliver a technical cut in the late liquidity window lending interest rate. 
Loan growth continues to slow down in response to the tight monetary policy stance and recent macroprudential measures. In line with these developments, the data regarding the first quarter of 2014 indicate some deceleration in private final domestic demand. Meanwhile, with the help of the recovery in foreign demand, the contribution of net exports to economic growth is expected to increase. The Committee expects that such a demand composition will support disinflation and lead to a significant improvement in the current account deficit in 2014. 
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days"

2014,Release Date: 30 April 2014,SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING,"No: 2014-27
Release Date: 30 April 2014
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING 
Meeting Date: 24 April 2014 
Inflation Developments 
1. In March, consumer prices rose by 1.13 percent month-on-month, and annual inflation increased by 0.5 points to 8.39 percent. The lagged effects of the depreciation in the Turkish lira continued to affect core inflation indicators adversely, particularly through the core goods channel. This, along with the unfavorable course of food prices, will cause inflation indicators to remain high for some time. 
2. Annual food group inflation increased slightly to 10.12 percent. In the first quarter, fruit and vegetable prices were moderate, while food prices excluding this group were substantially unfavorable. Especially processed food prices posted a sharp rise in the first three months of the year due to the depreciation of the Turkish lira and adverse weather conditions. Owing to these effects, the annual food price inflation is expected to rise further in April. 
3. Prices of services edged up by 0.65 percent month-on-month, and the group’s annual inflation increased by 0.26 points to 8.60 percent. This was largely attributed to the dramatic increase in catering prices (restaurants-hotels) caused by the developments in food prices excluding fruit and vegetables. Additionally, annual inflation in other services items excluding rents and transportation also increased. The seasonally adjusted data point to an ongoing rise in the underlying trend of services inflation in this period as well.
4. Annual core goods inflation increased by a marked 1.64 points to 10.04 percent in March. The annual inflation in durable consumer goods rising on the back of the Turkish lira depreciation reached 15 percent. Meanwhile, clothing prices recorded the highest March increase in the history of the index. This was mainly driven by cost and external demand related developments as well as the early launch of the new season. March was marked by a strong exchange rate pass-through across the core goods group. Accordingly, the seasonally-adjusted data pointed to a notable rise in the underlying trend of the core goods inflation. Thus, core inflation indicators registered a negative outlook as well.
Factors Affecting Inflation
5. According to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data for the fourth quarter of 2013, economic activity was largely consistent with the outlook presented in the January Inflation Report. In seasonally adjusted terms, GDP grew by 0.5 percent quarter-on-quarter, allowing economic activity to be more moderate in the second half of the year after a robust acceleration in the first half. Final domestic demand increased at a more rapid pace after a weak second and third quarter. Among final domestic demand components, private demand remained modest throughout 2013, while public demand followed a volatile path, thus determining the direction of domestic demand. In the fourth quarter, exports increased at a faster pace than imports on a quarterly basis, and demand components moved in the direction of rebalancing compared to the first half of the year as expected. 
6. Data for the first quarter of 2014 suggest that economic activity grew moderately. On the production side, the industrial production index remained broadly unchanged month-on-month in February after registering a monthly 1.0 percent increase in January. Thus, production was 1.7 percent higher from the previous quarter’s average during January-February and continued to grow steadily in quarterly terms. In the upcoming period, production is expected to grow further on the back of exports and the modest domestic demand. 
7. Data on spending show that private demand weakened in the first quarter due to developments in the consumption of durable goods and the private machinery-equipment. On the other hand, data on the consumption of nondurable goods and construction investments remain favorable. Among subcategories of imports of consumption goods, during January-February, imports of automobiles plunged, while imports of durable and semi-durable goods fell modestly and imports of nondurable goods continued to rise. In this period, the production of durable goods was down from the previous quarter, whereas the production of nondurable goods remained on the rise. As an indicator for machinery-equipment investments, the production of investment goods excluding transport somewhat flattened while imports of the same group declined. Moreover, data regarding construction investments show that the increase in construction investments continued. 
8. With the reduced uncertainty, the small yet discernible recovery in confidence indices and the appreciation of the Turkish lira, a recovery is expected in consumption demand. With the support of this recovery, domestic demand is expected to start growing steadily by the second quarter. Yet, second-quarter loan and imports data and BTS indices suggest that this recovery will be a moderate one.
9. Recent data show that exports continued to grow in the first quarter of 2014. The non-gold export volume index was up month-on-month in January and February and hovered above its fourth-quarter average during January-February. With the support of the global recovery signaled by recent survey indicators, the pickup in international trade and the Turkish lira depreciation, exports are expected to make a positive contribution to growth in the upcoming period. PMI and BTS export indicators hint at a similar pattern.
10. In sum, recent data releases indicate that final domestic demand will lose momentum in the first quarter, whereas exports will limit the impact of this slowdown on growth. With recent decline in uncertainties, private demand may start recovering as well by the second quarter of the year, which, however, might be curbed by tight financial conditions. Against this background, the Committee expects the rebalancing to continue and the current account deficit to improve significantly in 2014. 
11. In seasonally adjusted terms, total and non-farm unemployment rates continued to fall in January 2014. This drop in unemployment rates was mostly driven by the upsurge in non-farm employment. Employment basically increased across services and construction sectors. Industrial employment, on the other hand, increased only slightly and remained relatively weak. After having plummeted during the first months of 2014, confidence indices increased month-on-month in March. Furthermore, total employment expectations, a BTS indicator, continued to deliver positive returns despite a seasonally-adjusted monthly decline in April. 
Monetary Policy and Risks 
12. The Committee assessed the medium-term forecasts to be published in the April Inflation Report. It was noted that the main reason behind the annual consumer inflation’s overshooting of January forecasts in the first quarter of 2014 was exchange rate movements and the unfavorable course of food prices. Upon evaluating both the assumptions underlying inflation forecasts and external conditions, the end-2014 inflation forecast is revised upwards in view of exchange rates, import and oil prices, food prices and developments in underlying inflation trend. 
13. The Committee stated that loan growth rates continue to slow down in response to the tight monetary stance and the recent macro prudential measures. The slowdown in loan growth is mostly attributed to consumer loans and credit cards, while commercial loans expand at a rate similar to past years. This positive development in loan growth composition is expected to contribute to financial stability, the rebalancing process and the decrease in inflation. As a matter of fact, data regarding the first quarter of 2014 indicate some deceleration in private final domestic demand. Meanwhile, net exports are expected to contribute positively to economic growth thanks to the recovery in external demand, particularly from European countries, and real exchange rate developments. Given such a demand composition, the Committee expects that aggregate demand conditions will contain inflationary pressures and the current account deficit will exhibit a significant improvement in 2014. 
14. The Committee closely monitors inflation expectations and the pricing behavior. The slowdown in consumer loans and the weak private demand are expected to restrict the effect of the cost-push shocks on inflation in the coming period. However, lagged effects of the exchange rate movements and the unfavorable course of food prices are likely to cause inflation to remain above the target for some time. Given the elevated level of inflation, the Committee stated that it is important to prevent the negative effects on the pricing behavior and on the inflation trend. The strong and front-loaded monetary tightening delivered at the January interim meeting has contained the potential adverse impact of the upside risks on the medium term inflation expectations. Yet, considering that the positive impact of the monetary tightening will be observed on inflation with some lag, inflation might continue to increase in the short term, partly reflecting the base effects. In the meantime, the Committee will closely monitor inflation expectations and the pricing behavior and maintain the tight monetary policy stance until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. 
15. In times when negative effects on the inflation outlook are strong and uncertainties are large, the Central Bank may tighten the liquidity policy further to restrict these developments. During additional tightening, the yield curve can be inverted if necessary. The Committee indicated that the recent decline in uncertainties and the partial improvement in risk premium indicators have reduced the need for an additional tightening in liquidity policy. With the deceleration in private demand and the significant slowdown in consumer loans, the current tight monetary stance is believed to be enough to attain an inflation outlook consistent with medium term targets. In case of further deterioration in the trend of inflation or a dramatic rise in uncertainties, the Central Bank might implement additional tightening in liquidity policy. 
16. As the uncertainty about the Fed’s quantitative easing program has recently faded to a great extent and thanks to the global economic recovery, the risk sentiment across global financial markets has become more upbeat. Yet, expectations about the timing and pace of a Fed rate hike are of importance for pricing in financial markets. However, because the transmission mechanism of the interest rate channel is better known than quantitative easing and the monetary policy dependence on high-frequency data has decreased in this process, the uncertainty effect of an interest rate hike on financial markets might be more limited than that of the exit from the quantitative easing program. Hence, capital may start flowing back to emerging economies. Moreover, the ECB’s possible quantitative easing might be another supporting factor for capital flows. If this scenario materializes, the Central Bank might take steps to accumulate foreign exchange reserves. 
17. On the other hand, should there be long-lasting increases in uncertainties and risk premium; the economy may face an additional slowdown through the confidence and balance sheet channels. If such a risk materializes, the Central Bank will pursue a stabilizing policy by using its policy instruments to reduce the intermediation costs of the banks. In a scenario where it is necessary to tighten the liquidity policy, macro prudential tools might be used as a stabilizer to contain the repercussions on banking costs. Similarly, in a scenario where the external funding conditions tighten for banking sector, macro prudential policies might be implemented in a stabilizing way. The Committee pointed out the possibility of paying interest to the portion of reserve requirements held in Turkish liras in this context.
18. The Committee closely monitors developments on fiscal policy and tax adjustments with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes on administered prices in the forthcoming period. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal stance deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently, have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook. 
19. Strengthening structural reforms that will ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability in the medium term. Steps taken in this regard will also provide more room for maneuvering the monetary policy and improving social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels. In this respect, implementing the structural reforms required by the MTP remains to be of utmost importance."

CENTRAL BANK OF THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY PRESS RELEASE
The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey started to publish data on the contribution of export rediscount credits to the CBRT foreign exchange reserves on its website.
Pursuant to the CBRT regulations on rediscount which  were issued in the scope of Article 45 of the Central Bank Law, firms can obtain export rediscount credits from the CBRT through intermediary banks with a maturity of maximum 240 days, by presenting foreign exchange bills for rediscount.
Export rediscount credits are extended to firms through intermediary banks in Turkish lira equivalent of the foreign currency amount specified in the bill, which is calculated based on the exchange rate effective on the day that the credit is extended. As the repayments of these credits are made in foreign exchange, they help boost the CBRT foreign exchange reserves on the date of maturity. Export rediscount credits are extended with maturities of predominantly eight months and partly four months and shorter. Accordingly, their contribution to reserves varies depending on these maturities.
 
The contribution of these credits to the CBRT foreign exchange reserves will be published on the CBRT website;
 
Via EDDS (Electronic Data Delivery System); under the heading “CBRT BALANCE SHEET DATA”, with the title “The Contribution of Export Rediscount Credits to Foreign Exchange Reserves”, on a monthly basis covering the final data, on the second business day of that month.
These data are accessible on the CBRT website at:
http://evds.tcmb.gov.tr/cgi-bin/famecgi?cgi=$ozetweb&DIL=UK&ARAVERIGRUP=bie_rkdrk.db
 
Via the BANKING DATA link; with the title “The Contribution of Export Rediscount Credits to Foreign Exchange Reserves”, on a monthly basis covering the provisional data for the current month and the next three months, in addition to the final data published via EDDS. These provisional data will be updated weekly so as to reflect the effect of  credit utilizations with shorter-than-4-month maturities on foreign exchange reserves.
These data are accessible at: Statistics/Banking Data/The Contribution of Export Rediscount Credits to Foreign Exchange Reserves

DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE 
Meeting Date: May 22, 2014 
 
Participating Committee Members 
Erdem Başçı (Governor), Ahmet Faruk Aysan, Murat Çetinkaya, Turalay Kenç, Necati Şahin, Abdullah Yavaş, Mehmet Yörükoğlu.
 
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows: 
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been kept at 12 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been kept at 11.5 percent, and borrowing rate has been kept at 8 percent. 
b) One-week repo rate has been reduced from 10 percent to 9.5 percent. 
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been kept at 13.5 percent. 
With the recent decline in uncertainties and improvement in the risk premium indicators, market interest rates have fallen across all maturities. In this regard, the Committee decided on a measured decrease in the one week funding rate. The Committee stated that, with a flat yield curve even after this decision, the monetary policy stance will continue to be tight. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be closely monitored and the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook.
Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. In line with these developments, recent data indicate to a modest course in private final domestic demand. Meanwhile, with the help of the recovery in foreign demand, the contribution of net exports to economic growth is expected to increase. The Committee expects that such a demand composition will support disinflation and will lead to a significant improvement in the current account deficit in 2014. 
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

Release Date: 29 May 2014
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING 
Meeting Date: 22 May 2014 
Inflation Developments 
1. In April, consumer prices rose by 1.34 percent month-on-month, and annual inflation increased by 1 percentage points to 9.38 percent. This uptick in annual inflation was particularly driven by food prices. Meanwhile, the lagged effects of the depreciation in the Turkish lira continued to affect core inflation indicators adversely through the core goods channel. 
 
2. Annual food group inflation climbed to 13.15 percent amid soaring prices of fruits in April, contrary to their moderate course in the first quarter. The rise in the annual processed food inflation remained comparatively limited. 
 
3. Prices of services edged up by 0.55 percent month-on-month, and the group’s annual inflation remained flat at 8.61 percent. The persisting rise in the prices of catering services (restaurants-hotels) due to the developments in the food group excluding fruits and vegetables lost pace compared to the first quarter. Annual inflation in rents, transport and communication services exhibited a relatively mild course in this period, while other services (particularly health and education) posted rising figures. The seasonally adjusted data point to persisting high levels in the underlying trend of services inflation in this period without any further acceleration. 
4. Annual core goods inflation rose by 1.06 percentage points to 11.10 percent in April. With the effect of accumulated depreciation in the Turkish lira, the annual inflation in durable consumer goods reached 15.87 percent. In this group, price increases in automobiles and white goods decelerated in contrast to the upsurge in furniture prices. Meanwhile, clothing prices rose above seasonal averages in April and the group’s annual inflation reached 7.61 percent. April developments indicate that the effects of the exchange rate waned in some groups, yet spread across the core goods group. Accordingly, core goods became the main driver of the rise in the underlying trend of the core inflation. 
Factors Affecting Inflation 
5. Data for the first quarter of 2014 point to a moderate increase in economic activity. On the production side, following the rise in January, the industrial production index posted a slight fall in February and March. Thus, production maintained a steady trend of quarterly increase by exceeding the average of the previous quarter by 1.4 percent in the first quarter. The upcoming period is expected to witness an ongoing rise in production with the support of exports and modest course in the domestic demand. 
6. Data on expenditure side show that private demand weakened in the first quarter due to developments in the consumption of durable goods and the investment of private machinery-equipment. On the other hand, data on the consumption of nondurable goods and construction investments remain favorable. Among subcategories of imports of consumption goods, imports of automobiles plunged, while imports of durable and semi-durable goods fell moderately and imports of non-durable goods continued to rise in the first quarter. In this period, the production of durable goods was down from the previous quarter, whereas the production of nondurable goods remained on the rise. Among the indicators of machinery-equipment investments, the production and imports of investment goods excluding transport declined. Moreover, the data regarding construction investments show that the increase in construction investments continued. 
7. With the support of recovery in consumption demand thanks to reduced perceptions of uncertainty, improved confidence indices, and appreciation in Turkish lira, the domestic demand is expected to settle on a track of gradual increase starting from second quarter. Nevertheless, second-quarter CBRT Business Tendency Survey (BTS), PMI, loans and imports data suggest that this recovery will be moderate. 
8. Recent data show that exports continued to grow in the first quarter of 2014. The export volume index excluding gold rose again in March and hovered above its average in the previous quarter. With the support of the global recovery signaled by recent survey indicators, and the pickup in international trade, exports are envisaged to follow a favorable path in the upcoming period. PMI and BTS export indicators also support this outlook. 
9. In seasonally adjusted terms, total and non-farm unemployment rates declined in February 2014. This drop in unemployment rates was driven by the upsurge in non-farm employment. Furthermore, seasonally adjusted data regarding total employment expectations, a BTS indicator, maintain its trend of favorable outlook. 
10. In sum, recent data releases indicate that the private final domestic demand will follow a modest course, and with the help of the recovery in foreign demand, net exports will contribute positively to growth. It is expected that the current outlook in demand components will curb inflationist pressures and support the improvement in the current account deficit. 
Monetary Policy and Risks 
11. Owing to the significant decline in uncertainties about the Fed’s asset purchases recently coupled with the recovery in global growth, the risk 
sentiment improved across global financial markets. Along with these developments, emerging economies saw limited amounts of portfolio inflows after a long while. Risk indicators, which deteriorated in times of elevated country-specific risks in Turkey, recovered due to the waning domestic and external uncertainties. With the recent decline in uncertainties and improvement in the risk premium indicators, market interest rates declined across all maturities. In this regard, the Committee decided on a measured decrease in the one-week funding rate. It is stated that, with a flat yield curve even after this decision, the monetary policy stance will continue to be tight. 
12. The Committee closely monitors inflation expectations and the pricing behavior. The slowdown in consumer loans and the weak private demand are expected to restrict the effect of the cost-push shocks on inflation in the coming period. Moreover, thanks to the strong and front-loaded monetary 
tightening delivered in January and the recently-waned uncertainties, a considerable portion of the depreciation in the Turkish lira during the first 
quarter is reversed. This development in the exchange rates is assessed to contribute favorably to the inflation outlook. However, lagged effects of the exchange rate movements and the unfavorable course of food prices are likely to cause inflation to remain above the target for some time. In the meantime, the Committee will closely monitor inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation and maintain the tight monetary policy stance by keeping the yield curve flat until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook.
 13. The Committee stated that loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. Across subcategories, growth rates of consumer loans and credit cards exhibit a notable slowdown, while growth of commercial loans expand at a rate close to past years. The Committee assessed that this positive development in loan growth composition will contribute to financial stability, the rebalancing process and the decrease in inflation. In line with these developments, recent data indicate a modest course in the private final domestic demand. Meanwhile, net exports are expected to contribute positively to economic growth thanks to the recovery in external demand, particularly from European countries, and real exchange rate developments. The Committee expects that such a demand composition will support disinflation and will lead to a significant improvement in the current account deficit in 2014. 
14. Although having faded to a great extent, the uncertainty about global monetary policies is yet to disappear. Expectations about the timing and pace of the Fed’s rate hike are important to the pricing in financial markets. However, the transmission mechanism of the interest rate channel is better known than the quantitative easing and the monetary policy dependence on high-frequency data has decreased. As a result, it is assessed that the uncertainty effect of an interest rate hike on financial markets might be more limited than that of the exit from the quantitative easing program. Moreover, the ECB’s possible quantitative easing might be another supporting factor for capital flows. Hence, capital may start flowing back to emerging economies. If this scenario materializes, the Central Bank might take steps to accumulate foreign exchange reserves.
15. The Committee closely monitors developments on fiscal policy and tax adjustments with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes on administered prices in the forthcoming period. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal stance deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently, have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook. 
16. Strengthening structural reforms that will ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability in the medium term. Steps taken in this regard will also provide more room for maneuvering the monetary policy and improving social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels. In this respect, implementing the structural reforms required by the MTP remains to be of utmost importance."

DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE 
Meeting Date: June 24, 2014 
 
Participating Committee Members 
Erdem Başçı (Governor), Ahmet Faruk Aysan, Murat Çetinkaya, Turalay Kenç, Necati Şahin, Abdullah Yavaş, Mehmet Yörükoğlu.
 The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows: 
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been kept at 12 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been kept at 11.5 percent, and borrowing rate has been kept at 8 percent. 
b) One-week repo rate has been reduced from 9.5 percent to 8.75 percent. 
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been kept at 13.5 percent. 
Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. In line with these developments, recent data indicate to a modest course in private final domestic demand. Meanwhile, with the help of the recovery in foreign demand, exports contribute positively to economic growth. The Committee expects that such a demand composition will support disinflation and will lead to a significant improvement in the current account balance in 2014. 
The adverse impact of exchange rate developments since mid-2013 on annual inflation will gradually taper off. With the contribution of base effects, inflation is expected to decline markedly starting from this month. 
In light of these assessments and the recent improvement in global liquidity conditions, the Committee decided to deliver a measured cut in the one-week repo rate. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be closely monitored and the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. 
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

Release Date: 1 July 2014
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 24 June 2014
Inflation Developments
1. In May, consumer prices edged up by 0.40 percent month-on-month, and annual inflation reached 9.66 percent. This uptick in annual inflation was driven by the course of food and core goods prices. In this period, cumulative effects of the depreciation in the Turkish lira waned and the annual rate of increase in core inflation indicators followed a relatively flat course.
2. Annual food group inflation climbed by 1 percentage points to 14.11 percent amid soaring prices of unprocessed food group, the annual inflation of which reached 17.1 percent. On the processed food front, prices of bread and cereals continued with an upsurge, while the uptrend in other processed food products lost pace. As of May, the contribution of food prices to annual consumer inflation reached 3.4 percentage points. On the other hand, energy prices continued with a relatively favorable path with an annual increase of 4.62 percent.
3. Prices of services rose by 0.67 percent month-on-month, and the group’s annual inflation edged down to 8.52 percent in May. Annual inflation in restaurants-hotels and rents recorded an increase contrary to the decline in other sub-items of services. The seasonally adjusted data point to a downward trend, yet persisting high levels in the underlying trend of services inflation.
4. Annual core goods inflation crept up by 0.29 percentage points to 11.39 percent in May. Following the appreciation in the April-May period, prices of durable consumer goods registered a month-on-month decline for the first time since the start of the year. Meanwhile, annual inflation in core goods, excluding durable goods remained on the rise, witnessing the effects of the exchange rate with a further lag. The seasonally-adjusted data indicated a slight improvement in the underlying trend of the core goods inflation.
Factors Affecting Inflation
5. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data for the first quarter of 2014 proved broadly consistent with the outlook presented in the April Inflation Report. The public sector compensated for the fall in private sector demand, leading the final domestic demand to follow a flat course. Exports of goods and services continued to expand at a robust pace, while imports registered a quarterly decline. Thus, net exports appeared as the main driver of quarterly growth in the first quarter, and the rebalancing process among demand components continued as projected.
6. Data for the first quarter of 2014 point to a moderate increase in economic activity. On the production side, the industrial production index posted a month-on-month increase by 1.0 percent following a slight fall in the preceding two months. Thus, production maintained a steady trend of quarterly increase by exceeding the average of the previous quarter in the April. The upcoming period is expected to witness an ongoing modest rise in production with the support of exports and a rebound in the private domestic demand.
7. Data on the expenditure side exhibit a modest course in final private domestic demand in the second quarter. Among the indicators of consumption demand, the production and exports of non-durable goods rose, whereas the imports thereof declined quarter-on-quarter in April. Production and imports of durable goods recorded higher figures on a quarterly basis in April. Among indicators of consumption of durable goods, sales of automobiles displayed a flat course following a plunge in the first quarter, while the sales of white goods recorded an increase in the April-May period following an interval of two quarters. Thus, it is considered that the uptrend in the demand for non-durable goods continued in the second quarter, and that the fall in demand for durable goods may have halted. Indicators of machinery-equipment investments point to a flat course in the second quarter. Moreover, the data regarding construction investments show that the construction investments continued with a decelerating pace.
8. Owing to reduced perceptions of uncertainty, recovered confidence indices and improved financial conditions, consumption demand is projected to post better figures and final private domestic demand is expected to settle on a track of gradual increase starting from second quarter.
9. Recent data show that exports continued to grow in the second quarter of 2014 and contributed positively to growth owing also to the recovery in foreign demand. Having increased month-on-month in April, the export volume index excluding gold went above the average of the previous quarter. Due to the recent global recovery pointed by survey indicators and the improvement in world trade, exports are envisaged to support growth further in the upcoming period. However, the geopolitical developments in Iraq pose downside risks regarding the contribution of exports to growth in the second quarter.
10. The ongoing upsurge in employment since November 2013 lost pace in March and seasonally-adjusted unemployment rates followed a flat course. Industrial and construction employment paused in this period, while non-farm employment rose on the back of the services sector. Leading indicators on the second quarter point to a mild increase in employment.
Monetary Policy and Risks
11. Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. Consumer loans grew well below the historical averages in the first half of the year, while the deceleration in the growth of commercial loans remained relatively limited. The Committee stated that by limiting excessive consumption, the current growth composition of loans not only curbed inflation but also supported rebalancing.
12. In line with these developments, recent data indicate a modest course in private final domestic demand. Meanwhile, with the help of the recovery in foreign demand, exports contribute positively to economic growth. The Committee expects that such a demand composition will support disinflation and will lead to a significant improvement in the current account balance in 2014.
13. The adverse impact of exchange rate developments since mid-2013 on annual inflation will taper off. In fact, amid alleviated inflationary pressures stemming from the exchange rate, the underlying trend of core inflation indicators trended downwards particularly in durable goods for the first time after a long time in May. With the contribution of base effects, inflation is expected to decline markedly starting from this month. The Committee stated that the cumulative impact of food inflation and the exchange rate pass-through to annual headline inflation reached around 6.5 percentage points, which constitutes a considerable room for disinflation in the medium term. Meanwhile, the Committee added that the effects of the ongoing high inflation rates on the pricing behavior needed to be closely monitored.
14. The meeting also involved a discussion on the probable impact of the recent geopolitical developments on the current account balance and inflation. It was assessed that should uncertainties persist in Iraq, exports and oil prices channels may lead to a slowdown in the rebalancing process. Similarly, it was mentioned that if higher energy prices persist, it may lead to a limited impact on inflation. The Committee stated that providing a monetary policy reaction to the geopolitical uncertainties at this stage would not be appropriate; yet these developments should be closely monitored.
15. In the light of these assessments and the recent improvement in global liquidity conditions, the Committee decided to deliver a measured cut in the one-week repo rate. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be closely monitored and the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained by keeping a flat yield curve until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook.
16. The Committee closely monitors developments on fiscal policy and tax adjustments with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes on administered prices in the forthcoming period. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal stance deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently, have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
17. Strengthening structural reforms that will ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability in the medium term. Steps taken in this regard will also provide more room for maneuvering the monetary policy and improving social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels. In this respect, implementing the structural reforms required by the Medium Term Program remains to be of utmost importance."

2014,24 July 2014,SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING,"No: 2014-48
 24 July 2014
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 17 July 2014      
Inflation Developments
1.    In June, consumer prices increased by 0.31 percent and annual inflation declined to 9.16 percent. This decrease in annual inflation was driven primarily by food prices, but also by energy and services prices. In this period, the cumulative effects of the Turkish lira depreciation continued to weaken and the uptrend that started in the annual core goods inflation in early January stopped. Thus, the annual inflation in core indicators followed a relatively flat course.
 
2.    Annual food group inflation fell by 1.6 points to 12.47 percent, mainly on the back of the unprocessed food group whose annual inflation decreased by 4.4 points due to base effects, while the introduction of new fresh fruits to the index limited the decline in the group’s inflation. On the processed food front, rapid increases prevailed across all subcategories, particularly in bread and cereals, and annual inflation rose to 12.2 percent. The elevated food prices have been the main factor limiting the pace of decline in inflation. In fact, excluding the food group, the underlying consumer inflation trend has been slowing. On the other hand, the energy group continued to contribute favorably to consumer inflation with an annual increase of 4.25 percent. 
3.    Prices of services rose by 0.88 percent in June, and the group’s annual inflation edged down by 0.34 points to 8.18 percent. Annual inflation in restaurants-hotels, rents and transport were up in this period, while the decline in inflation was mainly driven by the base effect from driving school fees. Seasonally adjusted data point to a slowing yet still high underlying services inflation trend for June.
4.    Annual core goods inflation remained flat at 11.4 percent in June. Following the appreciation of the Turkish lira during April-May, prices of durable goods dropped for the second consecutive month, and the group’s annual inflation continued to decrease. Meanwhile, prices of core goods excluding durable goods, which witness the effects of the exchange rate with a further lag, remained on the rise. Accordingly, the exchange rate-driven inflationary pressures on the core goods group continued to subside. In fact, June’s seasonally adjusted data suggest a notable improvement in the underlying core goods inflation.
Factors Affecting Inflation
5.    Data for the second quarter of 2014 point to a moderate increase in economic activity. On the production side, the industrial production index declined by 1 percent in May after the 0.9 percent increase in April. The drop in May’s production was largely due to the sharp month-on-month fall in the production of capital goods. In May, the production of durable goods decreased slightly, whereas the production of nondurable goods rose, and the production of intermediate goods was flat. Thus, production remained unchanged during April-May. The upcoming period is expected to witness an ongoing modest rise in production with the support of exports and a rebound in domestic demand.
6.    Among the indicators of nondurable consumption demand, the production of nondurable goods increased quarter-on-quarter during April-May, whereas the imports of nondurable goods were down quarter-on-quarter. The production and imports of durable goods were up quarterly during April-May. Among indicators of durable goods demand, sales of automobiles were flat in the second quarter following the first-quarter plunge, while sales of home appliances registered an increase during April-May after a two-quarter slowdown. Thus, it is considered that the uptrend in the demand for nondurable goods continued in the second quarter and that the fall in the demand for durable goods may have halted. Indicators for machinery-equipment suggest that investments remain weak. Indicators for construction investments show that the increase in construction investments continued at a decelerating pace in the second quarter.
7.    With the decrease in uncertainty, the improved confidence indices and the declining volatility in the Turkish lira, consumption demand is expected to help domestic demand recover in the second half of 2014. This recovery is projected to be gradual and mild due to the tight monetary stance and macroprudential measures. 
8.    Exports continued to expand in the second quarter amid recovering external demand and contributed favorably to growth. Having increased slightly month-on-month in May, the non-gold export volume index surpassed the average of the previous quarter during April-May. Due to the modest global recovery signaled by recent survey indicators and the improving world trade, exports are envisaged to support growth further in the upcoming period. Yet, the geopolitical tensions in Iraq may pose downside risks on economic activity and the current account balance.
9.    The ongoing upsurge in employment since November 2013 lost pace during March-April and seasonally adjusted unemployment rates followed a flat course. Construction employment fell in this period, while industrial employment remained unchanged and non-farm employment rose on the back of the services sector. Leading indicators for the second quarter point to a mild increase in employment.
Monetary Policy and Risks
10.    The Committee assessed the medium-term forecasts to be included in the July Inflation Report. In the second quarter of 2014, the inflation excluding food was consistent with the April forecasts. Yet, the continued upsurge in food prices due to negative supply-side developments caused annual consumer inflation to remain above the forecast. The Committee stated that no major update was made to the assumptions underlying inflation forecasts and external conditions. Under the assumption that the upside risks to food prices are contained, the end-2014 inflation forecast of the April Inflation Report was left unchanged.
11.    Due to tight monetary policy stance and the macroprudential measures, loan growth rates remain at reasonable levels. In the first half of the year, consumer loan growth fell well below its average of recent years, while commercial loan growth was relatively more robust. The Committee concluded that this favorable growth composition of loans both contribute to the disinflation and supported the rebalancing by curbing private final demand.
12.    In line with these developments, domestic private final demand displays a modest outlook. Meanwhile, with the help of the recovery in foreign demand, exports contribute positively to economic growth. The Committee expects that such a demand composition will support disinflation and will lead to a significant improvement in the current account balance in 2014. Recent geopolitical developments, on the other hand, may pose downside risks to growth and balancing process directly due to the trade channel as well as the oil price channel. In addition, rise in oil prices may bear adverse effects on inflation.
13.    The adverse impact of exchange rate developments since mid-2013 on annual inflation is gradually tapering off. Indeed, the underlying trend of core inflation indicators has recently displayed a decline amid the alleviation of inflationary pressures led by the exchange rate particularly on durable goods. However, the high course of food prices due to supply-side developments in recent times limited the pace of decline in inflation. The committee stated that given the falling prices in international agricultural products in the second quarter, an active foreign trade policy for these products might curb upside risks to food prices.
14.    Recently, the Fed has stated that accommodative policies would be maintained for a long time and lowered the long-term interest rate expectations, which had a positive effect on the markets. In addition, the ECB reduced the policy rates and announced a new quantitative easing program, boosting the global risk appetite. These developments led to expansionary effects on global liquidity conditions, and capital inflows towards emerging economies saw a recovery. The Committee decided to deliver a measured cut in the one-week repo rate amid the fall in underlying inflation trend excluding food and improvement in global liquidity conditions. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be closely monitored and the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook.
15.    Emerging economies, including Turkey, saw an increase in portfolio inflows in recent months, reversing the outflows occurring since mid-2013. The mild global growth outlook and the favorable conditions for risk appetite are expected to further support capital flows to emerging economies in the upcoming period. Accordingly, should capital inflows accelerate; steps may be taken to strengthen foreign exchange reserves. Committee was also informed about the need for a technical change in the exchange rate composition of the Reserve Option Mechanism.
16.    The Committee closely monitors developments on fiscal policy and tax adjustments with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes on administered prices in the forthcoming period. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal stance deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently, have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
17.    Strengthening structural reforms that will ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability in the medium term. Steps taken in this regard will also provide more room for maneuvering the monetary policy and improving social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels. In this respect, implementing the structural reforms required by the Medium Term Program remains to be of utmost importance."

The adverse impact of exchange rate developments since mid-2013 on annual inflation is gradually tapering off. However, elevated food prices continue to delay the improvement in the inflation outlook. In this respect, the Committee also evaluated the possible impact of the drought and the geopolitical risks on the inflation outlook.
In light of these assessments the Committee decided to maintain the current stance within a more symmetric interest rate corridor. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be closely monitored and the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
2014,Release Date: 3 September 2014,SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY MEETING,"No: 2014-53
Release Date: 3 September 2014
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY MEETING 
Meeting Date: 27 August 2014
Inflation Developments 
1.    In July, consumer prices were up 0.45 percent and annual inflation increased by 0.16 points to 9.32 percent. This increase in annual inflation was driven primarily by prices of services, alcoholic beverages and tobacco, while the high course of food prices continued in this period. The underlying trend of services inflation remained elevated, whereas the trend in core goods continued to improve on the back of the fading cumulative effects of the Turkish lira depreciation. 
2.    Food inflation edged up to 12.56 percent year-on-year. In July, annual inflation declined to 12.1 percent in unprocessed food and reached 13 percent in processed food. Although the headline food inflation was relatively flat in this period, the annual rate of increase in food prices excluding fresh fruits and vegetables rose to 15.2 percent. This was mostly attributed to drought-related supply issues. 
3.    Down to 3.74 percent, the annual increase of energy prices continued to contribute favorably to consumer inflation. Alcoholic beverages and tobacco products added 0.12 points to annual consumer inflation due to increased prices of some cigarette brands.  
4.    Prices of services surged by 1.20 percent month-on-month, bringing annual services inflation up by 0.44 points to 8.62 percent. In this period, annual inflation was up across all subcategories of services. In particular, the annual inflation in restaurants and hotels continued to rise in line with food inflation. Therefore, the underlying trend of services inflation soared, curbing the improvement in core indices.
5.    Annual core goods inflation fell to 11 percent in July. After declining in May and June, prices of durable goods remained flat in July, driving annual durable goods inflation further down. However, annual inflation continued to rise in core goods excluding durables that respond with a lag to the exchange rate pass-through. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the underlying trend in core goods inflation continued to improve in this period.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6.    Second-quarter data point to a continued moderate growth in economic activity. On the production side, the industrial production index recovered its April rise in May and increased modestly in June. Thus, production remained flat during the second quarter. 
7.    On the spending front, domestic private final demand displays a moderate course. The production of consumer goods was higher quarter-on-quarter, whereas the imports of consumer goods were down from the previous quarter. A similar divergence was noted in the consumption demand for durable and nondurable goods. Automobile sales, an indicator for the durable goods demand, picked up moderately in the second quarter after the first-quarter plunge, and posted a rapid increase in July. Sales of home appliances, on the other hand, increased in the second quarter after a two-quarter slowdown. Thus, it is anticipated that the demand for nondurable goods registered a mild increase in the second quarter and the fall in the demand for durable goods may have halted. Meanwhile, indicators for machinery and equipment investments suggest that investments remain weak. Moreover, indicators for construction investments do not show any recovery at this point.
8.    Recent data suggest that the contribution of exports to growth may decrease in the upcoming period. The non-gold export volume index posted a monthly decline in June for the first time in a long while due to the geopolitical tensions in Iraq, Turkey’s second largest export destination, as well as due to the slowing economic activity in the euro area. These factors are likely to continue to put downside pressure on external demand for some time. In fact, leading indicators signal some slowdown in exports for the third quarter of the year.   
9.    In seasonally adjusted terms, total and nonfarm unemployment rates were higher in May 2014 than in the previous period. The rise in unemployment rates was largely due to the slowing nonfarm employment. In this period, industrial employment remained unchanged from the previous month, while construction employment declined. Moreover, the rate of increase in services employment slowed. Leading indicators for the third quarter signal no significant recovery for employment. The low levels of investment tendency suggest that a recovery in the labor market may take some time.
10.    In sum, domestic demand remains moderate while external demand loses momentum. Thus, economic activity is expected to have flattened in the second quarter after the robust quarterly growth in the first quarter. Survey indicators suggest that economic activity will remain moderate in the third quarter as well. Therefore, demand developments are not expected to put pressure on inflation in the upcoming period. Meanwhile, the improvement in the current account deficit may decelerate to some extent due to the slowdown in external demand growth. 
Monetary Policy and Risks 
11.    The Committee assessed that the recent growth rate and the composition of loans evolve in the desired direction, owing to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. Annual rate of growth in consumer loans continue to decrease, while commercial loan growth is relatively more robust. The current pace and composition of loans not only contain medium-term inflation pressures but also support the improvement in the current account balance. The Committee stated that the partial easing in financial conditions besides the decline in domestic uncertainties may affect the credit market positively in the upcoming period. Meanwhile, food prices surging amid drought coupled with the ongoing geopolitical risks may limit the increase in the consumer confidence and the credit demand in the short term.
12.    The adverse impact of cumulative exchange rate developments since mid-2013 on annual inflation is gradually tapering off. Having exceeded 3 percentage points in April, these effects are estimated to ease to around 2.5 percentage points as of July. The Committee highlighted that there is a considerable room for decline in inflation through this channel in 2015. However, it was also underlined that second round effects of the exchange rate pass-through should be closely monitored.
13.    The high course of food prices delays the improvement in the inflation outlook. In this respect, the Committee also evaluated the possible impact of the drought and the geopolitical risks on the inflation outlook. The Committee underlined that domestic food prices had recently decoupled from those abroad in a negative way. The food group has seen marked price increases since the start of the year, and no apparent correction is expected in the short term, partly due to the geopolitical risks. Given that the current elevated levels of inflation affect the medium-term expectations adversely and add on the risks to the pricing behavior, all relevant institutions’ involvement with the fight against inflation is deemed crucial for macroeconomic stability. In this scope, it was mentioned that an active foreign trade policy might be helpful in containing risks to food prices.
14.    In line with these assessments, the Committee decided to maintain the current stance regarding short-term interest rates. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be closely monitored and the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. Accordingly, the Committee reminded that the liquidity policy may be used actively when needed.
15.    The Committee highlighted that long-term interest rates had recently become less volatile amid the alleviation of uncertainties regarding global monetary policies. Coupled with unwinding domestic uncertainties, this has partially eased the need for a wide interest rate corridor. Accordingly, the Committee decided to reduce the overnight lending rate to render the interest rate corridor more symmetric.
16.    The Committee closely monitors developments on the fiscal policy and tax adjustments with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes on administered prices in the forthcoming period. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal stance deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently, have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook. 
17.    Strengthening structural reforms that will ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability in the medium term. Steps taken in this regard will also provide more room for maneuvering the monetary policy and improving social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels. In this respect, implementing the structural reforms required by the Medium Term Program remains to be of utmost importance."

Release Date: 5 September 2014
PRESS RELEASE ON THE MAXIMUM INTEREST RATES TO BE APPLIED TO CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS
The monthly maximum interest rates to be applied to credit card transactions are left unchanged.
The monthly maximum contractual and overdue interest rates to be applied to credit card transactions, which were set with the CBRT Communiqué No. 2013/11 on the Amendment to the Communiqué No. 2006/1 on Maximum Interest Rates To Be Applied To Credit Card Transactions published in the Official Gazette No: 28765 dated 14 September 2013 and which took effect as of 1 October 2013, will continue to be valid for the 3-month period starting on 1 October 2014.
Accordingly, the monthly maximum contractual interest rate to be applied to credit card transactions from 1 October 2014 to 31 December 2014 is 2.02 percent for the Turkish lira, 1.70 percent for the US dollar and 1.64 percent for the Euro, whereas the monthly maximum overdue interest rate is 2.52 percent for the Turkish lira, 2.20 percent for the US dollar and 2.14 percent for the Euro.
As of 1 October 2014, the contractual and overdue interest rates to be applied by banks to credit card transactions will not exceed the above-mentioned maximum rates. Banks are free to determine their respective rates at their own discretion provided that they are below the ceiling rates. The maximum contractual and overdue interest rates, which will be valid for the 3-month period starting on 1 January 2015 will be announced by the CBRT prior to this date.
Banks in Turkey, as is the case with the banks in other countries, set the credit card interest rates higher than those on consumer loans. Therefore, the CBRT advises credit card holders to prefer consumer loans rather than personal credit cards to meet their short-term credit needs."

Meeting Date: September 25, 2014
Participating Committee Members
Erdem Başçı (Governor), Ahmet Faruk Aysan, Murat Çetinkaya, Turalay Kenç, Necati Şahin,Abdullah Yavaş, Mehmet Yörükoğlu.
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 11.25 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 10.75 percent, and borrowing rate at 7.5 percent,
b) One-week repo rate at 8.25 percent,
c)  Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.75 percent.
Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. Exports remain supportive of balanced growth in spite of weakening global demand. 
Macroprudential measures taken at the beginning of the year and the tight monetary policy stance started to have favorable impact on the core inflation trend. Elevated food prices continue to delay the improvement in the inflation outlook. Meanwhile, declining commodity prices are expected to limit upside risks on inflation.       
Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be closely monitored and the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.

PRESS RELEASE ON THE SIXTH MEETING OF THE FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARD REGIONAL CONSULTATIVE GROUP FOR THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA
Today, the Central Bank of Jordan hosted the sixth meeting of the FSB Regional Consultative Group for the Middle East and North Africa (RCG-MENA) in Dead Sea, Jordan. 
At the meeting, the members of the RCG-MENA were updated on the FSB’s work plan and the progress made in the four core areas of financial regulatory reforms: building resilient financial institutions, “ending too-big-to-fail”, transforming shadow banking, and making derivatives markets safer. In regard to the “ending too-big-to-fail”, members discussed recovery and resolution of financial market infrastructures with particular reference to implementation challenges for the MENA region. The discussion also focused, from the MENA region perspective, on the issues in cross-border cooperation and information sharing for resolution purposes. 
Members discussed salient global macro-economic and macro-financial developments and their potential financial stability implications for the MENA region in the context of vulnerabilities in the global financial system and regional financial stability. Members also exchanged views on and shared experiences in reducing mechanistic reliance on the ratings of the credit rating agencies, and the plans for reducing such reliance. The role of supervisory capacity building for enhancing risk governance practices in financial institutions in the region was yet another theme of discussion. Members also deliberated on the impact of regulatory reforms on the long-term investments, with a focus on encouraging non-bank, market-based alternative financing mechanisms for promoting long-term investments.  
The RCG-MENA co-chairs Erdem Başçı, Governor, Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey and Riad Salame, Governor, Central Bank of Lebanon will report on these discussions at the upcoming FSB Plenary meeting. The current membership of the RCG-MENA includes financial and regulatory authorities from Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. The list of members of the RCG-MENA is accessible at: http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/about/rcgmena.pdf. 
Notes to editors
The FSB Charter stipulates that the FSB “should consult widely amongst its Members and with other stakeholders including private sector and non-member authorities. This process shall include engaging with the FSB Regional Consultative Groups and include an outreach to countries not included in the Regional Consultative Groups”[1].  
At the Toronto Summit in June 2010, the G20 Leaders endorsed such a process by calling on the FSB “to expand upon and formalize its outreach activities beyond the membership of the G-20 to reflect the global nature of our financial system”[2]. Responding to the call, the FSB established, in 2011, six Regional Consultative Groups [3] to bring together financial authorities from FSB member and non-member countries to exchange views on vulnerabilities affecting financial systems and on initiatives to promote financial stability.
The FSB has been established to coordinate at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard setting bodies and to develop and promote the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. Through the six regional groups, the FSB will be able to develop global financial policy initiatives through a more inclusive process.
The FSB is chaired by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England. Its Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland, and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.

2014,Release Date: 2 October 2014,SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY MEETING,"No: 2014-60
Release Date: 2 October 2014
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY MEETING
Meeting Date: 25 September 2014      
Inflation Developments
1. In August, consumer prices were up 0.09 percent and annual inflation increased by 0.22 points to 9.54 percent. This increase in annual inflation was driven primarily by prices of food and services groups. The contribution of food and catering services groups to annual inflation reached 4.4 percentage points in this period. The underlying trend of services inflation increased, whereas the improving trend in core goods became evident on the back of the fading cumulative effects of the depreciation in the Turkish lira.
2. Annual food inflation edged up to 14.44 percent. In August, annual inflation increased to 16.06 percent in unprocessed food and reached 13.15 percent in processed food. This increase has been determined by both supply-side constraints due to adverse weather conditions and the cumulative depreciation in the Turkish lira. Given this outlook, the group’s inflation bears the risk to remain elevated for a while.
3. Prices of services rose by 0.92 percent month-on-month, bringing annual services inflation up to 8.96 percent. In this period, annual inflation followed a rising trend across most subcategories of services. In tandem with food inflation, annual inflation in restaurants and hotels remained on the rise and reached 14.73 percent. Thus, having hovered around 8 percent since the start of 2014, services inflation rose approximately by 1 percentage points within the year. The underlying trend of services inflation continued with increasing figures, curbing the improvement in core indices.
4. Receding to 2.94 percent, the annual increase in energy prices contributed favorably to consumer inflation. However, the cumulative depreciation in the Turkish lira poses an upside risk to energy group inflation. Meanwhile, declining international energy prices in line with weakening global demand are thought to limit the upside risks.
5. Annual core goods inflation fell to 10.37 percent in August. Due to varying lags in the exchange rate pass-through among subcategories, annual inflation figures continued to decouple in sub-groups. Accordingly, annual inflation remained on the decline in durable goods, the prices of which have decreased since May, in contrast to the persisting rise in core goods excluding durables and clothing, which are affected by the exchange rate developments with a lag. Supported also by the higher-than-expected discount in clothing prices compared to recent years’ averages, the seasonally adjusted data revealed a sustained improvement in the underlying trend in core goods inflation.
6. In sum, adverse effects of the cumulative depreciation in the Turkish lira since mid-2013 are gradually waning. However, the Committee assessed that elevated food prices continue to delay the improvement in the inflation outlook.
Factors Affecting Inflation
7. Second-quarter GDP data point to sluggish economic activity compared to the outlook announced in the July Inflation Report. In this period, the increasing sentiment of uncertainty due to international developments and the slowing global growth led to a weaker-than-expected performance for consumer demand and exports, respectively. On the other hand, net exports continued to make positive contribution to annual growth.
8. Third-quarter data show a moderate quarterly increase in economic activity. On the production side, the Industrial Production Index grew by 1.8 percent in July, both month-on-month and quarter-on-quarter. However, due to shifting holidays and the automotive industry’s holiday scheme, production may experience some volatility in August and September, resulting in a more modest quarterly production growth. 
9. Data on the expenditure side point to a moderate recovery in domestic private demand in the third quarter. In July, the production of consumer goods was higher than the second-quarter average. Among indicators for the durable-goods demand, imports of durable goods declined, whereas the July-August average for the production of durable goods and the sales of automobiles and home appliances reveals a quarterly growth. The production and imports of investment goods excluding transport, an indicator for machinery-equipment investments, picked up. Among indicators for construction investments, the production of minerals decreased while their imports continued to rise. Meanwhile, data on July-August budget spending indicate that public demand might support growth in the third quarter.
10. Exports remain supportive of balanced growth in spite of weakening global demand. The non-gold export and import indices were up by a monthly 4.2 and 3.3 percent, respectively, in July. Indicators for August point to a fall in non-gold exports month-on-month due to geopolitical tensions and the automotive industry, and to a rise in non-gold imports. Geopolitical tensions and the waning global demand, particularly across Europe, are expected to put further pressure on external demand for some time. Thus, exports may provide less support to growth in the upcoming period than in the first half of the year.
11. In June, unemployment rates were higher quarter-on-quarter in seasonally adjusted terms. The rise in unemployment was largely due to a weaker non-farm employment. While labor force continued to grow, non-farm employment declined slightly during May-June because of losses in construction and industrial employment. On the other hand, services employment remains on the rise. Leading indicators for the third quarter point to a stagnant outlook for employment. The low levels of investment tendency and the moderate growth in industrial production suggest that a recovery in the labor market may take some time.
12. In sum, private demand is expected to recover modestly and gradually on the back of less tight financial conditions and waning domestic uncertainties. However, the weakening global demand, the uncertainty over global monetary policies and the lack of a strong and steady recovery in consumer and investor confidence add to the downside risks to growth.
Monetary Policy and Risks
13. The Committee stated that the recent growth rate and the composition of loans evolve in the desired direction, owing to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The annual growth rate of consumer loans remain at low levels, while commercial loan growth is relatively more robust. The current outlook in loans not only contains medium-term inflation pressures but also supports the improvement in the current account balance.
14. In line with these developments, the private sector demand is expected to follow a mild and gradual growth path after the slowdown in the second quarter. Exports, on the other hand, continue to support balanced growth in spite of the weakening global demand. Accordingly, it is believed that demand developments will not pose an upward pressure on inflation in the coming period, while supply-side factors will affect the course of inflation.
15. Macroprudential measures taken at the beginning of the year and the tight monetary policy stance started to have favorable impact on the core inflation trend. Having soared in early 2014, trend of core inflation indicators H and I have recently improved and most of the rise in inflation trend was taken back by August. Accordingly, the adverse impact of cumulative exchange rate developments on annual inflation is tapering off as well. The Committee highlighted that there is a considerable room for decline in inflation in 2015 through this channel. However, it was also underlined that second round effects and the recent volatility in exchange rates should be closely monitored.
16. Elevated food prices continue to delay the improvement in the inflation outlook. The Committee noted that domestic food prices have diverged negatively from international food prices in recent months. It is also suggested that the fall in commodity prices, driven by slowing global demand, might contain upside risks to inflation. The current elevated levels of inflation affect medium-term expectations adversely and boost risks related to pricing behavior. The Committee will closely monitor inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation and maintain the tight monetary policy stance by keeping a flat yield curve until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook.
17. Uncertainty regarding global monetary policies has continued to prevail in financial markets recently. While ending quantitative easing, the U.S. Federal Reserve stated that it would keep policy rates low for a considerable time. Moreover, the expectations of the level that policy rates will reach in the long run is lower than the pre-crisis level. In this context, the Committee was briefed on limits, interest rates and past implementations of Foreign Exchange and Banknotes Markets-Foreign Exchange Deposit Market. The European Central Bank has recently cut policy rates against the risks of economic slowdown and deflation and announced a quantitative easing program. Although such policies may lead to more capital flows into emerging markets, the volatility in capital flows persists.
18. For the purposes of financial stability, it is important to further strengthen the current healthy state of the banking sector. In this context, the Committee was informed about the preparations on remunerating the Turkish lira portion of required reserves, on a basis to encourage improving the deposit and equity ratios of the banking sector.
19. The Committee closely monitors developments on the fiscal policy and tax adjustments with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes on administered prices in the forthcoming period. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal stance deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently, have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
20. Strengthening structural reforms that will ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability in the medium term. Steps taken in this regard will also provide more room for maneuvering the monetary policy and improving social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels. In this respect, implementing the structural reforms required by the Medium Term Program remains to be of utmost importance."

2014,Inflation Developments,SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING,"SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 23 October 2014      
Inflation Developments
1. In September, consumer prices increased by 0.14 percent and annual inflation declined to 8.86 percent. The fall in annual inflation was mainly attributed to the positive outlook on core goods and energy while the contribution of food to annual inflation remained high. For the underlying inflation trend, the improvement in the core goods continues to some extent whereas the services category remains on the rise.
2. Annual food inflation fell to 13.95 percent. In September, annual inflation dropped in both unprocessed and processed food but remained elevated due to adverse weather conditions and the cumulative effects of exchange rates. However, indicators for October point to some decline in annual unprocessed food inflation.
3. Falling to 1.38 percent in September, annual energy inflation contribute favorably to consumer inflation. Having decreased due to the weakening global demand, international oil prices are expected to continue to support this outlook. Yet, the October adjustments on natural gas and electricity tariffs are likely to drive energy prices significantly higher. These hikes are forecasted to add about 0.4 percentage points to annual consumer inflation.

4. Prices of services rose by 0.9 percent in September and annual services inflation remained constant around 8.96 percent. In this period, restaurants and hotels inflation maintained its high level with 14.43 percent, while transport and rent inflation maintained their upward trend that has been accelerating in recent months. Annual core goods inflation dropped to 9.42 percent in this period. Annual inflation continued to fall in durable goods but rose further, albeit more slowly, in core goods excluding durables and clothing, which are affected by the exchange rate developments with a further lag. In line with the outlook on prices of services and core goods, underlying core inflation indicators continued to improve. 

5. In sum, elevated food prices delay the improvement in the inflation outlook, yet falling commodity, especially oil, prices, are expected to support disinflation foreseen for the next year.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6. Data for the third-quarter of 2014 show a moderate quarter-on-quarter increase in economic activity. On the production side, the industrial production index decreased by 1.4 percent in August after growing by 1.9 percent in July. Thus, during July-August, production rose by 1.1 percent quarter-on-quarter. With the support of exports, this outlook is expected to be preserved in September as well.

7. Data on the expenditure side point to a moderate recovery in domestic private demand for the third quarter after the first-half decline. During July-August, the production of durable and nondurable consumer goods and imports of total consumer goods recorded increases. Similarly, the sales of automobiles and home appliances have picked up on the back of more favorable financial conditions. Among indicators for machinery-equipment investments, the production of investment goods excluding transport rose during July-August while their imports decreased. Meanwhile, the production of minerals, an indicator for construction investments, declined whereas their imports continued to rise. Given the fall in construction employment, it is assessed that private construction investments have slowed in the third quarter. Thus, private consumer spending is expected to rebound quarter-on-quarter whereas private investment demand may continue its weak course in the third quarter. On the other hand, data on third-quarter budget spending indicate that public demand might support growth in the third quarter.

8. In August, the non-gold import index nearly flattened out month-on-month while the non-gold export index was down by 7.9 percent due to geopolitical tensions and the automotive industry’s August holiday scheme. Indicators for September point to a monthly fall in non-gold imports and to a rise in non-gold exports due to increased exports to Iraq and the pickup in the automotive industry compensating for the August decline. Hence, non-gold imports may post a slight quarterly increase in the third quarter of the year, whereas non-gold exports will remain flat. Moreover, it is assessed that weak global demand and geopolitical risks might continue to limit the contribution of net exports to growth in the final quarter.

9. In July, total and nonfarm unemployment rates were higher than in the previous period in seasonally adjusted terms. The rise in unemployment was largely due to weak outlook in non-farm employment. Yet the increase in labor force participation is marked. In this period, the downtrend in construction employment halted, while losses in industrial employment persisted. Meanwhile, services employment continued to support nonfarm employment. Leading indicators for the third quarter fail to signal a positive outlook for nonfarm employment. The low levels of investment tendency and the moderate growth in industrial production suggest that a recovery in the labor market may take some time.

10. To sum up, third-quarter data indicate that private domestic demand recovered modestly. As suggested by surveys, the moderate recovery of domestic demand may continue into the final quarter. However, a possible slowdown across European economies and geopolitical tensions may cause external demand to weaken. Therefore, economic activity is expected to grow moderately and gradually in the second half of the year. On the other hand, uncertainty over global monetary policies, the recent increase of volatility in financial markets and the weak consumer and investor confidence pose downside risks on growth. Thus, demand conditions are expected to limit the upside pressures on inflation while domestic demand developments will support the improvement in current account balance.
Monetary Policy and Risks
11. The Committee assessed the medium-term forecasts projected to be included in the October Inflation Report. Due to the negative supply-side developments, food prices remained elevated in the third quarter of 2014, which led the annual consumer inflation to exceed the forecasts presented in July Inflation Report. Upon the evaluation of assumptions underlying inflation forecasts and external conditions, given the developments in import and oil prices, food prices, energy price adjustments, output gap and the underlying inflation trend, year-end inflation forecasts for 2014 and 2015 were revised upwards.

12. Global financial markets have recently followed a volatile course. While, the Fed terminated its quantitative easing program, the timing and magnitude of the policy rate increase remained uncertain. The ECB reduced policy rates against the risks of economic slowdown and deflation and announced a new quantitative easing program through the purchase of covered bonds and asset-backed securities. Persisting uncertainties regarding global monetary policies and the downturn in global economic activity may lead to volatility in capital inflows towards emerging economies as well as their risk indicators. The Committee stated that the reduction in interest rates on the foreign exchange deposits that banks can borrow from the CBRT within their borrowing limits in the Foreign Exchange Deposit Market would support balanced growth and continuity of capital inflows towards Turkey during the normalization of global monetary policies. In addition, it is important to further strengthen the current healthy structure of the banking sector. Accordingly, the Committee stated that introducing an additional support to the core liabilities of financial institutions through remuneration of required reserves which are held in Turkish lira would spur balanced growth and domestic savings.

13. Elevated food prices delay the improvement in the inflation outlook. Unfavorable developments in food prices were mainly driven by supply conditions. Should supply conditions make no additional negative contribution in 2015, and food inflation near its averages of past years, there will be a considerable room for decline in inflation through this channel. Due to the recently-weakening global demand, falling commodity prices, oil in particular, are expected to support the disinflation process projected for 2015. In contrast to these positive developments in the inflation outlook, the current elevated levels of inflation affect the medium-term expectations adversely and boost risks related to pricing behavior. The Committee will closely monitor inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation, and maintain a tight monetary policy stance by keeping a flat yield curve until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook.

14. Growth rates and composition of loans evolve in the desired direction, owing to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. Consumer loan growth followed a weak course, while commercial loan growth was relatively more robust.  This favorable outlook of loans both contributes to disinflation and support rebalancing of the current account. Additional tightening measures will be taken should credit growth accelerate in a way that poses upside risks to inflation and aggravates financial risks by distorting the rebalancing process.

15. Recently-released data point to a deceleration in economic activity. An overall slowdown in growth in the global economy has been observed in the second and third quarters of 2014. Languishing external demand due to halting growth in the European countries, the largest export market of Turkey, besides geopolitical developments in neighboring countries limit the growth of exports. Falling commodity prices due to the weak global demand are expected to restrict growth in imports and improve the current account balance. Meanwhile, on account of the lingering volatility in financial markets and the sluggish course of confidence indices, private sector final demand does not exhibit a steady recovery. Therefore, it is expected that the projected recovery in economic activity will be gradual and aggregate demand developments will support the disinflation process. In the case of an additional slowdown in external demand and a sizeable decline in global growth rates, the decrease in commodity prices will pull inflation down. Nevertheless, domestic economic activity may witness notable adverse effects at the same time. Under such circumstances, the Committee will employ policy tools to support the economy.

16. Macroprudential measures taken at the beginning of the year coupled with the tight monetary stance have a favorable effect on the core inflation trend. Having significantly increased in early 2014, trend of core inflation indicators H and I have recently improved and most of the rise in inflation trend was taken back by the third quarter. Accordingly, the adverse impact of exchange rate developments on annual inflation is tapering off. This channel is assessed to provide inflation with a considerable room for decline in 2015. However, second-round effects and inflation expectations need to be closely monitored. In the event that additional deteriorations occur in the medium-term inflation outlook, liquidity and monetary policies would be tightened.
17. The Committee closely monitors developments on the fiscal policy and tax adjustments with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes on administered prices in the forthcoming period. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal stance deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently, have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.

18. Strengthening structural reforms that will ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability in the medium term. Steps taken in this regard will also provide more room for maneuvering the monetary policy and improving social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels. In this respect, implementing the structural reforms required by the Medium Term Program remains to be of utmost importance."

DECISION OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
Participating Committee Members
Erdem Başçı (Governor), Ahmet Faruk Aysan, Murat Çetinkaya, Necati Şahin,  Abdullah Yavaş, Mehmet Yörükoğlu. 
The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels:
a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 11.25 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 10.75 percent, and borrowing rate at 7.5 percent,
b) One-week repo rate at 8.25 percent,
c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.75 percent.
Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. Global demand remains weak, while the contribution of domestic demand to growth is increasing. However, the moderate course of consumer loans and the favorable terms of trade may contribute to the improvement in the current account balance.
Macroprudential measures taken at the beginning of the year and the tight monetary policy stance continue to have a favorable impact on the core inflation trend. However, elevated food prices delay the improvement in the inflation outlook. Meanwhile, current levels of commodity prices, in particular declining oil prices, are expected to contribute to disinflation foreseen for the next year. The Committee anticipates that, under the current monetary policy stance, inflation will decline in line with the forecast presented in the Inflation Report throughout 2015. 
Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be closely monitored and the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook.
It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance.

2014,27 November 2014,SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING,"No: 2014-70
27 November 2014
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 20 November 2014     
Inflation Developments
1. In October, consumer prices increased by 1.90 percent and annual inflation edged up by 0.10 points to 8.96 percent. The rise in annual inflation was mainly driven by the energy group due to the electricity and natural gas prices, and the contribution of food to annual inflation remained high. The relatively favorable course of underlying core goods inflation continued, whereas the services category remained on the rise.
2. Annual food inflation fell by 1.4 percentage points to 12.56 percent. This fall was mainly led by the unprocessed food group, particularly fresh fruits and vegetables, whereas annual processed food inflation increased. The seasonally-adjusted data pointed to a correction in September and October in unprocessed food prices, albeit limited, and the group’s annual inflation remained elevated. Indicators for November signal for a possible increase in the annual food inflation due to fruits and vegetables.
3. Owing to the adjustment in the electricity and natural gas tariffs, annual energy inflation rose by 3 points to 4.43 percent in October. However, the declining oil prices poses a downside pressure on the group’s inflation, particularly through the fuel and bottled gas prices. In fact, indicators for November suggest a notable fall in the annual energy inflation and sustained favorable contribution of the group to the consumer inflation.
4. Annual core goods inflation dropped by 0.5 points to 8.95 percent in October. Annual inflation, which has been on the decline in durable goods since May, recorded a decrease also in core goods excluding durables and clothing after a long time, indicating that the exchange rate effects have been quite alleviated. On the other hand, prices of services rose by 0.61 percent in October and annual services inflation edged up by 0.2 points to 9.17 percent. Annual inflation remained elevated in restaurants and hotels, and maintained the upward trend in transport services and rent groups.
5. The seasonally-adjusted data point to a sustained improvement in the underlying trend of core inflation indicators. A noticeable improvement was witnessed in core goods inflation following the first quarter, while the underlying trend of services inflation remained high.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6. Data for the third-quarter of 2014 show a more benign economic outlook than in the second quarter. Industrial production grew by 1.7 percent in September on a seasonally adjusted basis. Thus, industrial production rose by 1.5 percent quarter-on-quarter. This recovery in production is expected to continue with the support of domestic demand.
7. Data on the expenditure side point to a moderate recovery in domestic private demand for the third quarter after the first-half decline. In this period, the production of consumer goods rose on the back of durable goods, while the fall in the imports of consumer goods ended. The sales of automobiles and home appliances recovered markedly thanks to more favorable financial conditions. However, indicators for private investment demand display a weaker outlook. The production of capital goods picked up from the second quarter whereas imports of capital goods went down. 8. An indicator for construction investments, the production of minerals continued to decline, albeit more modestly, while construction employment remained weak. As a consequence, private construction investments are expected to slow slightly in the third quarter. Overall, private consumer spending is expected to rebound in this period whereas private investment demand may remain on a more moderate path.
8. Survey indicators for the fourth quarter suggest that the recovery may continue into the fourth quarter. The PMI and the Business Tendency Survey, both leading indicators for production, gave positive signals for the fourth-quarter industrial production. The domestic sales of automobiles increased in October, nearing the level in the final quarter of 2013. As an indicator for investments, the firms’ expectation for fixed-capital investments has been associated with positive signals for the past two months. Yet, it is too early to declare that this development hints at a permanent recovery for investments in the upcoming period. Meanwhile, the weak consumer confidence in October added to the downside risks on consumption.
9. The rise in total and nonfarm unemployment stopped in August in seasonally adjusted terms. After falling in previous periods, nonfarm employment rose in August, while labor force participation continued to increase. Construction and industrial employment began to rise again in line with the recent economic recovery. Meanwhile, services employment continues to grow steadily. Leading indicators for the final quarter signal a modest growth in nonfarm employment and a flattening in the unemployment rate. The low levels of investment tendency and the weak external demand suggest that the recovery in the labor market may take some time.
10. To sum up, domestic demand is expected to make more contribution to growth while economic activity is likely to recover moderately in the second half of the year. However, the uncertainty surrounding global monetary policies, the slowing yet continued financial volatility and the weak consumer confidence put downside pressure on economic activity. Against this background, demand conditions are expected to continue to limit the upside pressures on inflation.
Monetary Policy and Risks
11. The Committee indicated that the recent fall in market rates and risk premiums had an expansionary effect on financial conditions. However, the tight monetary stance and the macroprudential measures kept loan growth rates at reasonable levels. The composition of loans also continues to move in the desired direction. While the annual growth rate of consumer loans hovers around low levels, commercial loans remain relatively more robust. This loan outlook and the composition not only limit medium-term inflationary pressures but also support the improvement in the current account balance.
12. Global demand remains weak, while the contribution of domestic demand to growth is increasing. The second half of the year saw some recovery in private consumption and private machinery-equipment demand. In this period, contribution of exports to annual growth rate has moderated, largely due to the global economic slowdown. Despite this change in growth composition, the moderate course of consumer loans and the favorable changes in the terms of trade may contribute to the improvement in the current account balance.
13. The macroprudential measures adopted in early 2014 and the tight monetary stance continue to have a positive impact on the core inflation trend. Although elevated food prices delay the improvement in inflation, underlying inflation has displayed a marked decrease in core goods during recent months. Falling commodity prices, in particular declining oil prices, are expected to support the disinflation process foreseen for the next year.
14. On the other hand, the current elevated levels of services inflation and the medium-term expectations suggest that risks related to pricing behavior are still prevalent. The Committee will closely monitor inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation, and maintain a tight monetary policy stance by keeping a flat yield curve until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. The Committee anticipates that, under the current monetary policy stance, inflation will decline throughout 2015 in line with the forecast presented in the Inflation Report.
15. The meeting also involved a discussion of the importance of prudent borrowing against global risks. It was stated that capital flows to emerging markets may continue to be volatile in 2015. The ongoing uncertainty about the normalization of global monetary policies cause the global risk appetite and capital flows to be data-sensitive. The Committee emphasized that the CBRT has a rich set of policy tools to use against an earlier-than-expected policy rate hike by the Fed. Yet, Europe and Japan have announced new monetary expansion packages recently, and the economic slowdown might postpone the normalization of global monetary policies. Thus, a scenario in which global interest rates remain low for a long time while uncertainties over global economy persist gains prominence. As materialization of such a scenario would cause a surge in over-borrowing, it is crucial to support prudential borrowing to limit the accumulation of macrofinancial risks in the upcoming period. In this respect, the staff briefed the Committee about the possible measures that would encourage the extension of maturities for non-core liabilities.
16. Developments on the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes on administered prices. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently, have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
17. The Committee welcomed the development that the new Medium Term Program incorporates the fight against inflation as one of the main objectives. Moreover, it was indicated that Turkey’s growth potential would increase gradually with the implementation of the recently announced structural transformation program. Any measure to ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels."

2014,3 December 2014,Announcement of maximum interest rates for credit cards in Q1 2015,"No: 2014-73
3 December 2014
Announcement of maximum interest rates for credit cards in Q1 2015
The monthly maximum interest rates banks can charge on Turkish lira credit card borrowing in the first quarter of 2015 have been left unchanged. Meanwhile, instead of determining different rates for US dollar and euro, for all foreign exchange credit card borrowing the monthly maximum contractual and overdue interest rates are determined as 1.62 percent and 2.12 percent, respectively.
Accordingly, to be effective from 1 January 2015, for the credit card borrowings, the monthly maximum contractual interest rate is 2.02 percent for the Turkish lira and 1.62 percent for foreign exchange, whereas the monthly maximum overdue interest rate is 2.52 percent for the Turkish lira and 2.12 percent for foreign exchange.
Banks cannot charge higher interest rates than the rates announced by the CBRT for credit cards. Banks are free to determine their respective rates at their own discretion provided that they are below these ceilings. The maximum contractual and overdue interest rates for the three-month period starting on 1 April 2015 will be announced by the CBRT prior to that date.
Banks in Turkey, as is the case in other countries, charge higher interest rates for credit card borrowing than they do for consumer loans. The CBRT therefore advises credit card holders with short-term credit needs to seek a consumer loan rather than borrowing on personal credit cards.
Note:
The CBRT sets maximum interest rates for credit card borrowing under legal authority expressed most recently in the CBRT Communiqué No. 2014/5 on Maximum Interest Rates To Be Applied To Credit Card Transactions published in the Official Gazette No: 29153 dated 22 October 2014.

2014,31 December 2014,SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING,"No: 2014-78
31 December 2014
SUMMARY OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
Meeting Date: 24 December 2014     
Inflation Developments
1. In November, consumer prices rose by 0.18 percent and annual inflation edged up by 0.19 points to 9.15 percent. This rise in annual inflation was mainly driven by food prices. Meanwhile, the energy inflation declined considerably in line with the international oil prices. The underlying core goods inflation increased slightly, while the services inflation lost pace due to the favorable effects of falling energy prices.
2. Annual food inflation rose by 1.81 percentage points to 14.37 percent. This rise was led particularly by fresh fruits and vegetables, the annual inflation of which soared due to the base effect. The seasonally-adjusted data pointed to a partial correction in unprocessed food prices in the last three months. However, the unfavorable outlook that spilled over into processed food prices continued in November and inflation climbed to 13.61 percent in this group. Indicators for December signal a possible decline in the annual food inflation due to the unprocessed food group.
3. Energy prices decreased by 1.44 percent in November, and the group’s annual inflation dropped to 2.68 percent. The first-round effects of the decline in oil prices on energy prices, and consumer inflation in turn, appeared in fuel and bottled gas prices. Brent crude oil prices decreased approximately by USD 30 in the July-November period, and the direct effect of this decline through fuel and bottled gas prices on the consumer inflation was around -0.5 points in this period. Indicators for December suggest that in line with the decline in oil prices, the downward course in these two items continued, being more pronounced in fuel prices. Accordingly, the annual energy inflation is foreseen to decrease notably in December.
4. Annual core goods inflation increased approximately by 0.4 points to 9.36 percent in November. Annual inflation increased in durables and clothing, but remained on a downtrend in core goods excluding these items. Prices of services did not record a noticeable month-on-month change and the group’s annual inflation receded by 0.36 points to 8.81 percent. The decline in oil prices affected particularly fuel-related services groups positively, such as transport and package tours. This effect is projected to continue in the upcoming period.
5. The seasonally-adjusted data point to a sustained improvement in the underlying trend of core inflation indicators. The fall in the underlying trend of services inflation triggered by the items closely related to fuel prices contributed to this development.
Factors Affecting Inflation
6. Data released by TurkStat show that the GDP grew by a mere 1.7 percent year-on-year during the third quarter of 2014. On the production front, the marked yearly decline in the agricultural value-added has been a major factor in the slow GDP growth. On the expenditure front, the final domestic demand made a positive contribution to annual growth after contributing negatively a quarter ago, while net exports have been the main driver of annual growth. Among components of domestic demand, private demand has made a smaller contribution than public demand.
7. Data announced for the final quarter of 2014 point to an improved outlook for economic activity compared to the previous quarter. Even though industrial production decreased by 1.8 percent month-on-month in October, this realization stems largely from the correction of previous months and the effects of shifting holidays on seasonal adjustments. October-November data from the PMI and the Business Tendency Survey are actually signaling an increase in the fourth-quarter economic activity. Survey indicators show that expectations for the domestic market are stronger than those for exports. In this regard, with the support of the recovery in domestic demand, moderate growth in production is expected in the fourth quarter.
8. Leading data on the expenditure side point to a moderate fourth-quarter recovery in private domestic demand. During October-November, automobile sales continued to grow robustly quarter-on-quarter. Loans, on the other hand, remain on a modest growth path. Furthermore, the recovery in expectations for investment during the past three months is notable. Yet, consumer confidence has been weak throughout the last three months, suggesting that the downside risks on consumption still exist.
9. External demand indicators point to no improvement in the rebalancing process based on goods excluding gold, which ground to a halt in the third quarter. Europe’s slowing economy and geopolitical tensions have caused exports to lose some pace. However, the favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans are expected to contribute to the improvement in the current account balance.
10. In seasonally adjusted terms, total and nonfarm unemployment rates were higher in September than in the previous period. The rise in unemployment rates was caused by the increase in the ratio of nonfarm labor force to working-age population. All nonfarm subsectors, services in particular, added to employment growth. Total employment expectations, a Business Tendency Survey indicator, have moved further into positive territory during the final quarter. In this regard, nonfarm employment might see a modest increase in the final quarter. 
11. To sum up, fourth-quarter data point to a moderate recovery in economic activity. In this period, external demand remains weak, while the contribution of domestic demand to growth is at moderate levels. Yet, the prevailing signs of global economic slowdown, the uncertainty surrounding global monetary policies and geopolitical tensions put downside pressure on growth. Against this background, demand conditions are expected to support disinflation process.
Monetary Policy and Risks
12. Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and the macroprudential measures. The composition of loans also continues to move in the desired direction. While the annual growth rate of consumer loans hovers around low levels, commercial loans remain relatively more robust. This loan outlook not only limits medium-term inflationary pressures but also contributes to the improvement in the current account balance. Additional tightening measures will be taken, should credit growth accelerate in a way that poses upside risks to inflation and aggravates financial risks by distorting the rebalancing process.
13. Languishing external demand due to halting growth in European countries, the largest export market of Turkey, and geopolitical developments in neighboring countries limits the growth of exports. The fall in commodity prices, particularly in oil prices, due to the weak global demand is expected to improve the current account balance by restricting the aggregate spending on imports. Meanwhile, on account of the lingering volatility in financial markets and the sluggish course of confidence indices, private final demand contributes to growth at moderate levels. Therefore, it is expected that the projected recovery in economic activity will be gradual and aggregate demand developments will support the disinflation process. In the case of an additional slowdown in external demand and a sizeable decline in global growth rates, the decrease in commodity prices will pull inflation down. Nevertheless, domestic economic activity may witness notable adverse effects at the same time. Under such circumstances, the Committee will employ policy tools to support the economy.
14. Macroprudential measures taken at the beginning of the year coupled with the tight monetary stance continue to have a favorable effect on the core inflation trend. Accordingly, the adverse impact of cumulative exchange rate developments on annual inflation is also tapering off. Although high food prices delay the improvement in inflation, core inflation trends have displayed a marked decrease compared to the elevated levels in the first quarter. In addition, the fall in commodity prices, especially in oil prices, has shown a favorable impact on inflation. In the event that these new levels of oil prices prove to be largely permanent, this channel will support the projected disinflation process over the upcoming period.
15. Under the current monetary policy stance, the Committee anticipates that inflation will decline in line with the forecast presented in the Inflation Report throughout 2015, at a faster pace in the first half of the year. Along with these positive developments in the inflation outlook, the currently elevated levels of inflation still continue to pose upside risks to medium-term expectations and the pricing behavior. In the forthcoming period, inflation expectations, the pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be closely monitored and the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping the yield curve flat, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook.
16. Global financial markets have followed a volatile course recently. It was stated that capital flows to emerging markets may continue to be volatile in 2015. The ongoing uncertainty about the normalization of global monetary policies cause the global risk appetite and capital flows to be data-sensitive. The Committee emphasized that the CBRT has a rich set of policy tools to use against an earlier-than-expected policy rate hike by the Fed.
17. Yet, with the global economic slowdown the normalization of monetary policies might be postponed. In an environment of continued uncertainty over global financial markets and economic activity, it is crucial to support prudential borrowing to limit the accumulation of macrofinancial risks. In this respect, the Committee pointed out the downward trend in long-term interest rates at the global level. It was stated that this trend has been directing banks to use more long-term borrowing under current market circumstances. The Committee members also stated that the implementation of the measures intended for discouraging short-term borrowing by the first quarter of 2015 will offer additional benefits for financial stability.
18. Developments on the fiscal policy and tax adjustments are monitored closely with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary policy stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes on administered prices. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal policy deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently, have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook.
19. The Committee welcomed the development that the new Medium Term Program incorporates disinflation as one of the main objectives. Moreover, it was indicated that Turkey’s growth potential would increase gradually with the implementation of the recently announced structural transformation program. Any measure to ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability and contribute positively to social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels."
